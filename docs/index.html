                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/james-prev-150x150-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/james-prev-150x150-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-128705"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Studnicki</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The authors of three papers about abortion Sage retracted earlier this year have sued the publisher, alleging the company pulled the articles “for pretextual and discriminatory reasons.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, Sage <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/06/papers-used-by-judge-to-justify-abortion-pill-suspension-retracted/">retracted three articles</a> from <em>Health Services Research and Managerial Epidemiology</em> “because of undeclared conflicts of interest and after expert reviewers found that the studies demonstrate a lack of scientific rigor that invalidates or renders unreliable the authors’ conclusions,” according to the publisher’s <a href="https://perspectivesblog.sagepub.com/blog/note-from-sage-on-retractions-in-health-services-research-and-managerial-epidemiology">statement</a> at the time. Sage also removed the paper’s lead author from the editorial board of the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-publisher-retracts-studies-cited-by-texas-judge-suspending-abortion-pills-2024-02-06/">cited two of the articles</a> last year in his decision to suspend approval of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation#:~:text=Mifepristone%20is%20a%20drug%20that,of%20the%20last%20menstrual%20period).">mifepristone</a>, a drug used in medical abortions.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130152"></span>



<p>Sage’s actions “violated California contract, tort, and civil rights law,” according to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10z_WsdnfzzhJ49u0UFG7awQSomp8LB5h/view?usp=sharing">lawsuit</a>, filed Thursday in California’s Ventura County Superior Court. The authors also allege the retractions have caused “enormous and incalculable harm” to their professional reputations, and “they are now being treated as pariahs.”</p>



<p>Their lawsuit seeks to compel Sage to enter arbitration of their claims, as required by the publishing agreements the authors signed with the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawyers for the authors claim Sage has “engaged in a months-long campaign of cat-and-mouse negotiations apparently designed to delay arbitration and pressure the Authors into waiving their discovery rights as a condition of arbitrating.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage declined to comment on the pending litigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Studnicki, the lead author of the three papers, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/06/papers-used-by-judge-to-justify-abortion-pill-suspension-retracted/">previously told Retraction Watch</a> the retractions were “a blatant attempt to discredit excellent research which is incongruent with a preferred abortion narrative.” When we asked Studnicki, also vice president and director of data analytics at the pro-life <a href="https://lozierinstitute.org/adf-consovoy-mccarthy-sue-academic-publisher-for-politically-motivated-retractions/">Charlotte Lozier Institute</a>, for comment on the suit, and what he and his coauthors hoped to gain from arbitration, he referred us to the “Demand for Arbitration” attached as Exhibit J to the petition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that document, the authors allege Sage “did not articulate any scientific basis or legitimate editorial policy for retracting the Articles,” and thus breached its publishing agreements in doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retractions “were also an act of invidious discrimination,” the authors allege, as the publisher “applied inconsistent retraction standards to the Authors based on Sage&#8217;s perception of the Authors&#8217; pro-life affiliations,” in violation of California’s anti-discrimination law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The demand for arbitration states the authors are entitled to monetary relief for the harm to their reputations. “[T]he only way to make the Authors whole is to grant injunctive relief requiring Sage to comply with the plain terms of its Agreements by rescinding its retractions,” the suit states.</p>



<p><em>Health Services Research and Managerial Epidemiology, </em>is no longer accepting new submissions, according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/HME">its website</a>. A Sage spokesperson did not immediately answer our query about when and why the journal closed submissions.</p>

                <p>This coming <strong>Tuesday, October 8, 2024</strong>, the entire arXiv staff will be attending an in person all-staff meeting. Because all editorial staff will be participating in this professional development, it will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This brief change will only affect the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As the full arXiv staff gathers together for a full day of team-building and project planning, announcements will be slightly deferred.</p>
<p>As you plan your submissions to arXiv in the next few days, please be aware of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tuesday, October 8, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Monday, October 7, 2024, and before 14:00ET Wednesday October 9, 2024 will be announced on Wednesday October 9, 2024 20:00ET.</li>
</ul>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/psychedelics-from-ancient-rituals-to-modern-medicine">Psychedelics: From Ancient Rituals to Modern Medicine</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine a world where ancient shamans and modern-day scientists found a common ground towards exploring the intricacies and workings of the human mind. Psychedelics, substances known for their profound effects on consciousness, have woven through human history from their applications in sacred rituals to cutting-edge research. While the use of psychoactive substances for medicinal or spiritual practices stretches across decades, the first study investigating the effects of psychedelics in a clinical context was documented in the 20th century. Today, psychedelics are once again in the spotlight, showing promise as treatments for mental health conditions, and offering new insights into the human mind. This fascinating class of substances consists of compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, Ayahuasca, Mescaline, DMT (Dimethyltryptamine), and more! But, have you ever wondered how these substances were discovered? Well, let&apos;s dive into that.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Case of the Curious Chemist</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the bustling labs of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals in Basel, Switzerland during the late 1930s, the air was filled with scents of chemicals and the ever-present hum of scientific inquiry. Albert Hofmann, a chemist passionate about uncovering the mysteries of nature’s compounds, embarked on a journey to synthesize new substances from ergot, a fungus known for its medicinal value. What was his goal? It was to synthesize compounds that could treat migraines and circulatory distress. Meanwhile, Hofmann’s work led to the advent of LSD-25. Although initially this didn’t seem interesting to researchers and was put aside for some time, in 1943 something extraordinary happened! As the day was winding down, Hofmann accidentally absorbed a small amount of LSD-25 through his fingertips. Suddenly, his perception of the lab transformed. Colors around him became incredibly vibrant, patterns danced before his eyes. Totally unaware of the cause of this experience, he called it a <em>cosmic sensation</em>.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Intrigued by his accidental discovery, Hofmann explored the effects of LSD-25 more deliberately. Ingesting a dose higher than what he had before, Hofmann felt a sense of anticipation mixed with trepidation. Soon, unable to stay still, he embarked on a bicycle ride back home, described as an intense and enlightening journey. As he pedalled through the quiet streets of Basel, the world around him seemed to have shifted into a kaleidoscope of colors and patterns. Sounds became more profound, and his thoughts flew freely, weaving intricate connections between ideas and emotions. The mere act of riding a bicycle became an exploration of consciousness! This little trip of exploration highlighted LSD-25 as a potential substance for chemical curiosity and as a tool for understanding the workings of the human brain.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Rippling through time</strong></em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hofmann’s discovery marked the beginning of a brand-new era in both science and culture. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, psychedelics gained a ton of popularity, not only in scientific research but also within the counterculture movement. Researchers explored their potential in psychotherapy, creativity enhancement, and spiritual practices. However, societal fears and political pressure eventually led to the regulation and prohibition of these substances by the late 1980s. Thus, it wasn’t until recent years that psychedelics experienced a resurgence in scientific research, exhibiting new insights into mental health and delving into consciousness. Even though these compounds have already shown tremendous potential effects, neural circuitry and correlates underlying responses evoked by these compounds were only recently elucidated.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>How do psychedelics rewire consciousness at the neural level?</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD-25, and DMT work their magic by interacting with a specific subset of neuronal receptors, known as serotonin type 2 (5HT-2A) receptors. 5HT-2A receptors are localized abundantly in the prefrontal cortex, a brain area responsible for higher-order cognitive functions such as complex thinking and perception. Upon binding a protein called Gq/11, a signaling cascade is activated inside the neuron which subsequently triggers the phospholipase C, (PLC) enzyme. This enzyme breaks down a molecule in the cell membrane and produces inositol phosphate (IP3) and DAG. The former leads to calcium release from storage sites, while DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). These molecules work together to change the activity of a neuron by influencing how the neuron communicates with other neurons. As a result, the brain experiences increased connectivity between different regions, leading to vivid imagery, altered perception, and profound cognitive shifts that regulate the psychedelic experience.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4>Psychedelics: From recreation to therapy</h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1960s, <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>, co-founder of Apple, explored LSD-25 during his search for meaning and creativity. He described his psychedelic experience as a transformative one, claiming that exposure to psychedelics has opened up his mind to new ways of thinking and playing a pivotal role in shaping his innovative vision for technology. Jobs credited these experiences with helping him approach challenges at the organization with a unique perspective, ultimately contributing to the groundbreaking products that revolutionized the tech industry. His story beautifully illustrates how psychedelics can inspire creativity and innovation in profound ways.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highlighting a story of hope, <strong>Kari Gleiser</strong>, a patient struggling with treatment-resistant depression, found solace in psilocybin-assisted therapy. After years of battling dark thoughts, she participated in a clinical trial at Johns Hopkins University. Under the guidance of therapists, Kari’s psilocybin sessions led to profound insights and emotional breakthroughs. The once-overwhelming weight of depression was lifted, giving her a renewed sense of hope and connection. Her story is one of many that illustrate the potential of psychedelics to offer healing where traditional treatments have not worked. These stories underscore the diverse impact of psychedelics: from inspiring creativity and personal growth to providing profound therapeutic effects and relief.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As science, innovation, and medicine continue to undergo breakthroughs it becomes tremendously important for scientists, clinicians as well as policymakers in conjunction with the public to actively engage in open, informed discussions about the potential of psychedelics. With careful research and responsible applications, these substances could become valuable tools in our ongoing effort to understand and improve the human mind, offering hope to millions across the globe.</p>

<p>A physiatrist in Italy has lost four publications this year after two groups of researchers raised concerns about his research.</p>



<p>The physician, <a href="https://web.unica.it/unica/it/ateneo_s07_ss01.page?contentId=SHD30992">Marco Monticone</a>, a professor at the University of Cagliari, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/09/pain-researchers-lose-three-papers-after-cochrane-group-questioned-data/">had three papers pulled</a> in 2022, as we reported at the time. Those retractions followed a <a href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/abstract/2023/01000/investigating_the_veracity_of_a_sample_of.13.aspx">critique</a> by Cochrane researchers who analyzed data in 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) headed by Monticone.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/neil-oconnell">Neil O’Connell</a>, of Brunel University of London, lead author of the critique, told us:</p>



<span id="more-130140"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In eight trials we found serious concerns that we felt amounted to a body of evidence that warrants consideration for retraction. The 2 trials that look like outsiders were both small pilot studies (2014, 2018) with some concerns but less clear. However, after our investigation we flagged all 10 trials to the respective editors and shared our work. There is a wider question of trust when concerns are raised across multiple papers from a single author team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In February of this year, <em>The Clinical Journal of Pain </em>retracted one more of the studies flagged by O’Connell’s team, “<a href="https://journals.lww.com/clinicalpain/citation/2013/11000/effect_of_a_long_lasting_multidisciplinary_program.2.aspx">Effect of a Long-lasting Multidisciplinary Program on Disability and Fear-Avoidance Behaviors in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial</a>.” The <a href="https://journals.lww.com/clinicalpain/citation/2024/04000/effect_of_a_long_lasting_multidisciplinary_program.1.aspx">notice</a> cited the critique, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When approached for an explanation, the authors provided detailed responses; however, they were unable to provide an adequate explanation that satisfactorily addressed our concerns, which includes the veracity of the data presented in the article. The authors have been informed of the decision to retract their article from this Journal, and have published a response in the journal Pain [see “<a href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/citation/2023/04000/untrustworthiness_of_trial_data_on_spinal_pain__a.32.aspx">Untrustworthiness of trial data on spinal pain: a stigmatizing investigation to take with many a grain of salt</a>” by Marco Monticone and <a href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/citation/2023/04000/reply_to_monticone.33.aspx">the reply</a> by O’Connell and his colleagues].</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 98 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>On August 15, the journal <em>Clinical Rehabilitation </em>pulled three additional studies by Monticone:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215513519342">Task-oriented exercises and early full weight-bearing contribute to improving disability after total hip replacement: a randomized controlled trial</a>.”</li>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Sage and Clinical Rehabilitation were contacted by a reader who stated concerns about the authenticity of the data presented in these studies.

<p>The authors provided their raw, underlying data when Sage contacted them for comment. The Journal Editors believe that the core questions on the authenticity of the data from these publications have not been fully addressed and resolved.</p>



<p>Due to the unresolved questions about the authenticity of the data the Editors retract these articles.</p>



<p>M.M., E.A., and S.F. disagree with the retraction decision. All other authors did not respond to this notice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We asked Avril Drummond, editor-in-chief of <em>Clinical Rehabilitation</em>, to elaborate on the concerns mentioned in the notices and the “unresolved questions,” but she had not replied by press time. (We also pointed out that, contrary to what the notice stated, O’Connell’s critique did not include the studies retracted in August.)</p>



<p>Bolland and colleagues, whose work the notice cited, examined data with known or suspected integrity issues, including 17 RCTs by Monticone’s group. Describing Monticone’s research, their paper stated:</p>

<p>[T]he differences between trial groups were smaller than expected. Again, there were about twice as many variables as expected that only differed by one or two participants between groups, and far fewer variables than expected that differed by four or more participants between groups. Again, the overall observed distribution was markedly different from the expected distribution (P=1.5*10<sup>9</sup>).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Monticone did not respond to emails seeking comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Meanwhile, several of the studies flagged by O’Connell’s group in 2022 remain in print, as his team pointed out last year in a letter to the editor titled “<a href="https://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(23)00042-2/fulltext">Effective quality control in the medical literature: investigation and retraction vs inaction</a>.”</p>



<p>“Our team’s view is best captured by Amanda Williams in that paper,” O’Connell told us, referring to a passage that stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>What have we learned? … while error and fraud are acknowledged as widespread, some editors appear disinclined to believe that their journals are affected; and that whistleblowers may still need to pursue concerns that are editors’ responsibilities.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We contacted the editors-in-chief and publishers of two of the journals in which these papers appear, the <em>European Spine Journal</em> and the <em>European Journal of Pain.</em> A spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes the <em>European Spine Journal</em>, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We can confirm that we are aware of concerns with these papers and are carefully investigating the matter in line with our usual processes. We would be happy to provide an update once further information is available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes the <em>European Journal of Pain</em>, said: “We are investigating these concerns in accordance with COPE guidelines.”</p>

<p>A newly appointed dean at the University of Guelph in Canada has had two papers retracted for “evidence of authorship manipulation.” </p>



<p>Another article by the researcher, Moncef Nehdi, formerly of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, seems to match a paper that had its authorship advertised for sale, according to a <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/241169A9835B42B1FCFC69AD18898A#">post</a> on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nehdi told Retraction Watch he stands by his group’s work in the two retracted papers, but agreed with the retractions because he thought the investigations “raised some valid concerns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nehdi began a five-year term as dean of the University of Guelph’s College of Engineering and Physical Sciences on September 1, according to an <a href="https://news.uoguelph.ca/2024/05/u-of-g-appoints-dr-moncef-nehdi-as-dean-college-of-engineering-and-physical-sciences-2/">announcement</a> this spring. The announcement stated:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130133"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A prolific author, Nehdi has written more than 470 research publications and was listed by Elsevier and the Shanghai Global Ranking in the world’s top 60 most impactful civil engineers. Nehdi is well positioned to advance U of G’s reputation as a leader in sustainability research with his expertise in sustainable construction, artificial intelligence and machine learning in civil engineering.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The University of Guelph has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last year, two Elsevier journals retracted articles on which Nehdi was the corresponding author. The notices, which were similar, began:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief. Following receipt of a whistle-blower complaint, an investigation of this paper was conducted. The Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the scientific integrity of this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Each paper “exhibits evidence of authorship manipulation,” the notices stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice for “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950061822018487">Mechanical, thermal, durability and microstructural behavior of hybrid waste-modified green reactive powder concrete</a>,” originally published in <em>Construction and Building Materials</em> in August 2022, continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Changes in authorship were made to the paper during the review and revision process, in contravention of the journal policies on authorship changes. The journal apologises to readers for not having identified these changes at the time. Following correspondence with the authorship of this paper, questions regarding appropriate contribution of all co-authors are raised. Multiple authors admit not knowing the others and “never having collaborated”. One author identified their contribution as “XRD analysis”; none is reported in the paper. The corresponding author was unable to identify the laboratories at which all aspects of the experimental [sic] were conducted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The six authors listed on the paper are affiliated with six different universities in five countries. The article has been cited 15 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other retracted article, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221450952200273X">Alkali-activated fly ash concrete with untreated coal aggregate: Fresh- and hardened state properties</a>,” appeared in <em>Case Studies in Construction Materials</em> in December 2022. It has only been cited by its retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Seven co-authors were added to the paper during the review and revision process, in contravention of the journal policies on authorship changes,” according to the notice. It continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In the course of the investigation two issues of potential data manipulation were also identified. When raw data was requested from the corresponding author, of the initial submission [not the corresponding author listed in the published version, but still a co-author] curated data was provided. The metadata on the curated data predates the reported conduct of the study by five years. Photos of test specimens provided as ‘proof’ the study was conducted were clearly of different dimension than those reported in the paper.</p>



<p>The corresponding author of the published paper is unable to provide more clarifying information and has indicated agreement with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The 13 authors on the paper are affiliated with 12 different universities in 10 countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nehdi and his team “collaborate on research studies with international scholars when we believe that it brings a multi-disciplinary perspective to problem solving and enhances the research outcomes,” and “rely on their professionalism and work ethics,” he <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Nehdi-comment.pdf">told us</a>. “In each study, we collaborate, in good faith, and use our best judgement [sic] to ensure that the data is authentic, the scientific basis is robust, and that every co-author has significantly contributed to the work to be published.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier began scrutinizing Nehdi’s two retracted articles as it investigated all the papers of a coauthor who “was involved in data manipulation in various publications they co-authored with a reputed scholar in Europe, who is also the editor of a Q1 journal,” Nehdi told us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Nehdi’s coauthors, Arash Karimi Pour, listed at the University of Texas at El Paso, has lost 21 other papers, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dKarimipour%252c%2bArash">by our count</a>. We previously <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/07/13/engineering-researcher-who-cast-blame-on-co-author-will-soon-have-12-retractions/">reported on him</a> as a coauthor of <a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/homepage/ist12299">Jorge de Brito</a>, a civil engineering researcher and professor at the University of Lisbon with more than a dozen retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When approached about the issue, I recommended retracting both papers since I believe that retraction is better than keeping in the open literature publications that may have doubt about possible data manipulation or other ethical concerns,” Nehdi said. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>To be clear, I still believe that our work reported in both studies is sound, but I lost faith in the part of the work contributed by the said co-author, and thus I supported the retraction decisions. The partial evidence I had is that when I asked specific questions to my co-author that were conveyed to me by the journal, they did not produce consistent answers with what I have understood during the paper development and publication process. So, I reported the answers as is to the journals and thought retraction was warranted.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January 2022 an advert was placed on an Iranian Telegram channel offering authorship of a paper. The keywords are a match to this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wise included a screenshot of the advertisement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was not aware of this issue, and I have no good reason to doubt the scientific accuracy or ethical standards of the work,” Nehdi told us. “I would be interested to know more about where the information comes from regarding the paper potentially having been advertised as having authorship positions for sale. If there is reasonable doubt that the claim is true, I will take the initiative and ask the journal to retract it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Unfortunately, as very busy researchers who pursue quality work and abide by high ethical standards within an established culture of research excellence in our reputed institutions, we do not think about issues like these until they sadly happen. We have learned the hard way that collaborating with other scholars who are far away can create some vulnerably [sic]. Retracting those papers was an eye opener for me, and I personally have since been trying to learn from the experience to heighten the scrutiny of who we can collaborate with going forward and have declined numerous opportunities to collaborate on research studies for risk mitigation.</p>

<p>At the heart of any paper mill’s operations sits an unavoidable contradiction. On the one hand, paper mills must keep their operations clandestine lest they be discovered and have their clients’ articles retracted <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/30/journal-retracts-80-papers-idd-as-paper-mill-products-following-sleuths-report-undark-retraction-watch-investigation/">en masse</a>. On the other, paper mills must make themselves visible to some degree to attract new customers. For instance, advertisements for paper mills abound on services like <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/09/02/anyone-can-start-a-papermill/">WhatsApp and Telegram</a>. This contradiction makes it difficult for researchers like us who study systematic fraud to get a full sense of the scope of any paper mill’s operations. By charting the web presence of one shady business, we sought to do just that.</p>



<p>About a year ago, we began probing search engines with queries a scientist desperate for publications might make: “authorship for sale,” “call for co-authors,” “scopus-indexed publications,” “guaranteed journal acceptance,” etc. We figured paper mills would litter their pages with these phrases in a bid to be easily found by customers. Sure enough, one of our first searches directed us to the front page of the Academic Research and Development Association (ARDA), based in Chennai, India.</p>



<p>ARDA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240908085319/http://www.ardaconference.com/">presents itself</a> as a professional organization that offers services including “Conferences and Meetings”, “Journal Publications” and “Article Writing Services”. ARDA also maintains lists of indexed journals in which it can guarantee publication, along with guidelines on how long acceptance should take and instructions to limit plagiarism to a journal-specific threshold. All of these journals claim to be peer-reviewed on their own websites. Many of the titles listed on ARDA’s site are well-known hijacked journals already found on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>. Other journals, such as the <em>International Journal of Early Childhood Special Education </em>and the <em>Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative Results</em>, are favorites of authors from Saveetha Dental College, a school <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj1231">caught inflating its rankings in a large self-citation scheme</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130129"></span>



<p>We sent an inquiry about prices for publication in February 2023, for which they quoted us US$250 to US$450 per article, depending on our journal of interest.</p>

<p>In April 2023, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230412185733/https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/">ARDA began to list</a> a handful of journals from the same publisher, Technoarete Publishing, on its website. Technoarete Publishing is owned by Technoarete Group, which shares its CEO, Rudra Bhanu Satpathy, and street address with ARDA. Technoarete has several subsidiaries (e.g. the Institute for Engineering Research and Publication, or IFERP, BioLeagues, and United Innovators) that also offer publishing services on their websites, listing many of the same journals as ARDA does on its website.</p>



<p>This discovery convinced us that ARDA represents just the tip of the iceberg. By searching for other entities, first through direct links (e.g. a parent company publicly listing its subsidiaries) and then through more subtle indicators (e.g. businesses that shared the same address or phone number), we uncovered <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/arda_relationships_230621.csv">a network of associations</a> consisting of 828 distinct businesses, journals, publishers, individuals, universities, professional societies and indexing services.</p>

(R) the network itself.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Several of these businesses (such as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240613015810/https://iser.org.in/journals.php">Institute for Scientific and Engineering Research</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240713035210/https://worldacademics.net/journal.php">World Academics</a>) have websites that are almost identical in layout and function to ARDA’s, offering article writing and publication in many of the same journals. Many websites shared Technoarete’s declaration that they were the “World&#8217;s largest Non-profitable [<em>sic</em>]<em> </em>professional association registered under India Trust Act(1882)”.</p>



<p>BioLEAGUES, a Technoarete subsidiary, appears to oversee at least eight different professional societies, including the Asia Pacific Association for Dental and Oral Health (APADENTO) and the Universal Society of Food and Nutrition (USFN). Like BioLEAGUES, the websites of these professional societies also advertise publication in indexed journals.</p>



<p>These professional societies also organize conferences that give out ‘Best Paper’ awards to attending academics. Several of the award recipients publish frequently in journals including the <em>International Journal of Early Childhood Special Education</em> and the <em>Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative Results</em>, looping us back to ARDA. Until September 2024, BioLEAGUES also controlled an official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240602162838/https://www.cureus.com/channels/bioleagues">‘channel’</a> in the Springer Nature journal <em>Cureus</em>, the world’s largest medical journal by annual publication volume, which allows BioLEAGUES to appoint its own editorial officers and handle its own submissions to <em>Cureus</em>. This channel published at least 131 articles between February 2023 and September 2024.</p>



<p>Several of the websites presented themselves as dashboards where academics might find upcoming conferences, with names like Conference Next, All Conference Alert, and International Conference Alerts. Upon closer inspection, these thousands of conferences hardly appeared to be real. Many could be taking place in multiple countries on the same day, or could be one of 10 conferences organized on the same day by ‘Jeff Jones’ or ‘Emma Davis’. They could even be taking place within an active war zone; in August 2022, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220817165624/https://conferencenext.com/conferences/ukraine">Conference Next advertised</a> dozens of upcoming international conferences in Kharkiv, Ukraine amidst Russian missile strikes on the city. In fact, these websites seemed to be able to offer conferences in whatever major city users could search.</p>



<p>Our investigation also led us to IFERP, another Technoarete subsidiary which reported Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with at least 17 different universities in four countries for ‘Publications’ or ‘Journal Publications’. We located <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MOU_IFERP.pdf">one such MOU</a> between IFERP and the Bharat Institute of Engineering and Technology (BIET) in which IFERP guarantees to publish 30 to 50 papers from a conference organized by BIET in one of nine Scopus-indexed journals. The 2021 conference <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jUElO0pC5Zy1cmJtqxaP_MwuxX3GqHFh/view?usp=drive_link">wound up hosting 118 papers</a>. We found several papers from this conference that were published in the <em>Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education, </em>a hijacked journal de-indexed by Scopus effective 2020 and listed by ARDA until 2021.</p>

<p>Several businesses had <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XTXPci2ZMUXKG8OHrFZw7kOOFex49Ape/view?usp=drive_link">bulk request forms</a> for article writing and publication on their website. One stated on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wxtQBUzi9OYr_Q0jTFrD3-ofO3wFW1Ud/view?usp=drive_link">its FAQ page</a> that if a journal gets de-indexed by Scopus, it will publish the client’s article in a back-dated issue. This business also states they “offer authorship as well as multiple authorship options through our previous authors and upcoming authors who can fund themselves”. United Innovators, another Technoarete subsidiary, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240303092752/https://www.unitedinnovator.com/patent-filing.php">offers patent filing as a service</a>, suggesting this network of associations extends into other areas of the scientific enterprise.</p>



<p>In summary, for every legitimate kind of scientific activity, be it publishing articles, organizing conferences and professional societies or patenting new technologies, we found an ARDA-affiliated organization selling a fake version of that activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We sought comment from ARDA, Technoarete Group, IFERP, BioLEAGUES, and their CEO Rudra Bhanu Satpathy, but have not heard back.</p>



<p>It appears the term ‘paper mill’ may fail to fully capture the diversity and scale of activities overseen by these hydra-like conglomerates. Moreover, the high-level view of these networks that we’ve unraveled suggests an extraordinary ability to adapt and the capability for aggressive growth – a picture of a resilient enterprise. With so many functionally identical business fronts operating concurrently, those operating the network need not worry if one business is identified publicly, one professional society shuts down or one journal is de-indexed; plenty will remain to fill its place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Veteran paper mill observers will be reminded of OMICS Group, a predatory publisher that was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/22/us-court-issues-injunction-omics-stop-deceptive-practices/">ordered to pay $50 million to the US government</a> for deceptive business practices, but survives to this day through a series of <a href="https://doi.org/10.3138/jsp-2023-0095">loosely connected subsidiaries and spinouts</a>.</p>



<p>Our quest to map out a full network of associations around one particular business revealed this business was just one head on a hidden hydra, ready to sprout two more if that head was lost. If paper mills and their ilk are as tenacious and robust as this example suggests, we should not settle for half-measures that can be easily evaded. Successfully fighting them will require the kind of large-scale coordination they themselves have displayed.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cureus.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cureus-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-124583" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cureus-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cureus-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cureus-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cureus.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Web of Science, Clarivate’s influential database of abstracts and citations, has paused indexation of new content from the open-access journals <em>Heliyon</em> and <em>Cureus</em>, apparently due to concerns about the quality of their articles.</p>



<p>Indexation in WoS or Scopus, another major bibliometric database owned by Elsevier, has become an important stamp of approval for scholarly publications worldwide and can make or break a journal.</p>



<p>WoS is “making a big call here, taking aim at two of the mega-journals that have grown massively in recent years,” said <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Nick Wise</a>, a scientific sleuth and a researcher at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. “WoS appears to be one of the only organisations with the power to compel big publishers to act. I don’t think that’s a sign of a healthy academic publishing system, but it’s how things are currently.”</p>



<span id="more-130124"></span>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/mohammed-o-al-amr/">Mohammed Al-Amr</a> noted the news about <em>Heliyon</em> <a href="https://x.com/mohd_alamr/status/1840056824931737892">over the weekend</a> on X.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, which in addition to owning Scopus is also the parent company of Cell Press, the publisher of <em>Heliyon</em>, told us it is “investigating” but would not elaborate. According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/heliyon">its website</a>, “<em>Heliyon</em> considers research from all areas of the physical, applied, life, social and medical sciences.”</p>



<p>Graham Parker-Finger, director of publishing and customer success at <em>Cureus</em>, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Obviously, we are disappointed by this news and are waiting for information about why Clarivate has chosen to take this step. We are absolutely committed to the integrity of our journal, investigating all concerns that are raised with us as well as acting proactively, and we expect to be able to resolve this situation in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We have reported <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cureus/">frequently</a> on <em>Cureus</em> in the past. The journal, a Springer Nature title that prides itself on speedy publication, has drawn flak for <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/24/cureus-its-reviewing-and-its-scholarly-impact-quotient/">publishing low-quality studies</a> and hosting “channels” that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">allow questionable organizations to hand-pick their own editors</a>. Earlier this year, it <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/26/journal-retracts-more-than-50-studies-from-saudi-arabia-for-faked-authorship/">retracted 55 papers</a> from Saudi Arabia for dubious authorship.</p>



<p>Wise noted:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It is very interesting that WoS have put Cureus and Heliyon on hold on grounds of quality (if I’m reading the journal master list correctly). The Cureus ‘academic channels’ appear purpose-built to be abused by papermills, whilst no article is out of scope at Heliyon. The journals are set up so that they can never be removed from the list for publishing articles that are out of scope, as others have been previously.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lonni Besançon, an assistant professor of visualization at Linköping University in Sweden and a scientific sleuth, said he worried the fast peer-review process at <em>Cureus</em> could undermine quality. He highlighted a study of the use of <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/111851-regular-use-of-ivermectin-as-prophylaxis-for-covid-19-led-up-to-a-92-reduction-in-covid-19-mortality-rate-in-a-dose-response-manner-results-of-a-prospective-observational-study-of-a-strictly-controlled-population-of-88012-subjects#!/">ivermectin to prevent COVID-19</a> that was later <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.10.23293924v2">found to be flawed</a>.</p>



<p>“Overall, I’d say that I’m happy that [<em>Cureus</em> and <em>Heliyon</em>] are put on hold and that, perhaps, there is something that is going to be done about potentially problematic journals or groups,”<em>&nbsp;</em>Besançon told us.<em> </em>He added he was “wondering if we could have more transparency on the process and what prompted this move” by WoS.</p>



<p>A pop-up box on <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/home">Clarivate’s website</a> defining the on-hold status states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been raised about the quality of the content published in this journal. The journal is being re-evaluated according to our selection criteria; new content will not be indexed during the course of the re-evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rachel Scheer, director of external communications, academia and government, at Clarivate, told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When the evaluation is complete, the publisher will be informed of the outcome and the journal will either be removed from coverage if it no longer meets the quality criteria or remain covered if it continues to meet the quality criteria.<br><em><br></em>The freely accessible Master Journal List is updated monthly and should be considered the authoritative source for Web of Science coverage.   </p>
</blockquote>



<p>James Butcher, the author of the newsletter <a href="https://ck.journalology.com/">Journalology</a>, wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7246207958466932737/">a September 29 LinkedIn post</a> about the new developments:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We should assume innocence until we hear otherwise. We don&#8217;t know what aspects of the journals the Web of Science team is investigating. <br><em><br></em>However, other fast growing journals have fallen foul of Web of Science indexing criteria.<br><em><br></em>IJERPH (MDPI) was delisted last year [Ed: see <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fast-growing-open-access-journals-stripped-coveted-impact-factors">more coverage here</a>] for publishing articles that were out of scope and output plummeted as a result.</p>
