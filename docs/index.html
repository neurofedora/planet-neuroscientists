                A neuroscientific and philosophical exploration into the nature of consciousness, raising the fundamental question of whether consciousness is a product of the brain or exists as a distinct, separate entity. The warmth of sunlight on your face, the ache of nostalgia, the vibrant, ineffable beauty of the colour green – these private, intimate experiences are known as qualia. Everything you experience possesses a distinct phenomenological character; there is a specific way it feels to undergo...

<p>A university in Japan has suspended a fishery science professor for a month after its investigation found fabrication in a retracted paper on fish freezing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.iwate-u.ac.jp/upload/da182e51b00b76b5ce16a5275fcfb861_2.pdf">the investigatory report</a>, Iwate University scrutinized a retracted paper coauthored by six researchers at the school, including <a href="https://univdb.iwate-u.ac.jp/html/858_en.html">Chunhong Yuan</a>, a professor of fishery systems science. Following the researchers’ inability to provide the investigating committee with appropriate records of the reported experiment, the inquiry found Yuan and two unnamed coauthors – a graduate student and an individual now retired – fabricated claims about the experimental conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yuan has been suspended for one month starting December 25, according to a <a href="https://www-iwate--u-ac-jp.translate.goog/info/news/2025/12/007116.html?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">press release</a>. The university plans to administer additional training on research integrity for laboratory leaders, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133832"></span>



<p>While the report doesn’t name the retracted article, Yuan’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157525007215">only retraction to date</a> appeared in October for an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157525001139">April 2025 paper</a> published in Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Food Composition and Analysis</em>. The paper compared a novel freezing method for salmon sashimi to more traditional methods. The paper has not been cited outside of its own retraction, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The case was brought to our attention by Haklak Rockbill, professor emeritus at Ochanomizu University who <a href="https://haklak.com/">tracks and writes</a> about research ethics and misconduct<em>.</em> </p>



<p>The retraction notice states the article was retracted by the authors for concerns “regarding the verification of specific details related to the [freezing] instrument used in the study.” One of the concerns in the Iwate investigation was that the first author, identified in the published paper as graduate student Faria Afrin, said she was advised by her supervisor to record the model number of a different device from the one used in the experiment.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/yuan-chunhong.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="741" height="1024" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/yuan-chunhong-741x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-133834" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/yuan-chunhong-741x1024.jpg 741w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/yuan-chunhong-217x300.jpg 217w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/yuan-chunhong.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chunhong Yuan</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Other experimental documentation was also missing, with the report concluding that the research team had failed to make and retain proper records. Yuan was chastised for not appropriately instructing and supervising Afrin.</p>



<p>The report found Afrin intentionally committed fraud, despite being incorrectly advised by Yuan, concluding the graduate student prioritized publication based on poorly planned experiments that were inappropriately recorded.</p>



<p>Neither Yuan nor Afrin, now a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faria-a-15189a231/?originalSubdomain=jp">doctoral student at Iwate</a>, responded to our multiple requests for comment via email and LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation began in May 2025 (a month after the publication of the article in <em>Journal of Food Composition and Analysis</em> and five months before its retraction), according to the report. The inquiry was triggered by a complaint that the experimental conditions of samples which were said to have been frozen were different from what was described in the paper.</p>



<p>The university did not respond to our request for information, including questions regarding the origin of the complaint.</p>



<p>The investigation team ultimately found three of the authors committed misconduct: the first author on the paper (Afrin); former specially appointed researcher “C,” whom the report says is retired; and Yuan, who supervised Afrin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also said Yuan neglected her duty as PI. Although the report says Afrin will be disciplined, it does not detail how.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted paper included two authors from other universities: Youling Xiong from the University of Kentucky, and A.K.M. Azad Shah from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, in Bangladesh. The paper’s authors did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>

</div>


<p>Elsevier has pulled a dozen papers by a finance professor in Ireland who oversaw the review of the articles and made “the final decision” to publish them in three journals he edited, according to the retraction notices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The professor, <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/business/people/faculty-professors/blucey/">Brian M. Lucey</a> of Trinity College Dublin, and his coauthors disagreed with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?authors=brian+lucey&amp;qs=retracted">the retractions</a>, which came a few days before Christmas.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not disputing the fact that I made the final decision” to publish the articles, some of which have garnered <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Brian-Lucey-2025-retractions.pdf">hundreds of citations</a>, Lucey told us in an interview. ”What I&#8217;m disputing is that that is not prima facie grounds” for retracting them.</p>



<span id="more-133815"></span>



<p>”Because here&#8217;s the thing: Elsevier are aware of [editors publishing in their own journals] as a pretty common practice in finance and economics. We&#8217;ve given them evidence of hundreds of instances of this. And nothing has happened, which does raise the question, you know, maybe they&#8217;re going to go back and go look at all these. Presumably, they will treat everything the same.&#8221; Lucey <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EiC-Own-Journal-Publishing.pdf">shared his list</a> of such instances. It includes 240 articles, 133 of which are in <em>Science of the Total Environment</em>, which was <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-11-28/the-fall-of-a-prolific-science-journal-exposes-the-billion-dollar-profits-of-scientific-publishing.html">delisted from Clarivate’s Web of Science</a> in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/publisher-retracts-12-papers-co-authored-by-trinity-college-dublin-finance-professor/a999912496.html">first reported</a> by the Irish Independent, Lucey and his coauthors, who include several high-profile economists, have complained about the retractions to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). He told us “COPE and publishers’ guidelines say you should only retract when the science is wrong.” (In fact, <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20retraction%20is%20to%20correct,*%20Be%20freely%20accessible%20to%20all%20readers">COPE’s guidelines are more nuanced</a>, stating articles can be retracted when the “peer review or publication process was compromised,” and editors “should always make the final decision about retracting material, except in instances where the editor is compromised or has a conflict of interest.”)</p>



<p>Lucey has held top editorial positions at all three Elsevier titles involved in the retractions – the <em>International Review of Financial Analysis</em>, the <em>International Review of Economics &amp; Finance</em> and <em>Finance Research Letters</em> – but said his business relationship with the publisher ended last fall by mutual agreement. His decision to publish his own work in the journals was “the rationale given” by Elsevier for wanting to end the relationship, he said. Lucey is currently editor-in-chief at Wiley’s <em>Journal of Economic Surveys</em> and Springer Nature’s <em>Energy Finance</em>.</p>



<p>A close collaborator of Lucey’s, <a href="https://businessschool.luiss.it/en/samuel-a-vigne-2/">Samuel A. Vigne</a> of Luiss Business School in Rome, who until recently was an editor-in-chief of <em>Finance Research Letters</em> and an associate editor of the <em>International Review of Financial Analysis</em>, also has disappeared from those journals’ editorial boards, their websites show. Vigne did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>“We can confirm these papers were retracted from 19 December to 23 December 2025,” an Elsevier spokesperson told us. “We uphold the highest standards of rigor and ethics in our publishing to protect the quality and integrity of research. Editors can publish in their journals as long as they are compliant to our policies. Please refer to our <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/publishing-ethics">Publishing Ethics</a> policies for further information regarding editorial conflicts of interests. These policies usually do not apply to editorials, notes and similar types of articles.”</p>



<p>“We can’t provide further insights regarding editors’ contracts while investigations are ongoing,” the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>The retraction notices vary in the specific editorial role ascribed to Lucey, but otherwise are identically worded.</p>



<p>“Elsevier&#8217;s Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics team, with guidance from an impartial field expert acting in the role of an independent Publishing Ethics Advisor, conducted an investigation and determined that the article should be retracted,” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059056024000959">one notice states</a>.</p>



<p>”Review of this submission was overseen, and the final decision was made, by the Editor Brian Lucey, despite his role as a co-author of the manuscript,” it continues. ”This compromised the editorial process and breached the journal&#8217;s policies.”</p>



<p>Some of the articles have been cited hundreds of times. “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521918305271">Cryptocurrencies as a financial asset: A systematic analysis</a>,” for instance, has racked up 707 citations, according to Clarivate Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardtol_retracted-trading-volume-and-the-predictability-activity-7409624966788169728-7rVk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAByWXIBtsn0tXWeQa9YSfv4kSeHd4MCfrg">a post</a> about Lucey’s retractions by Richard Tol of the University of Sussex, in England, drew dozens of comments from other economists.</p>



<p>“It was about time! Anyway, publishing in these specific journals is very bad signaling &#8211; for quite a few years now &#8211; in many institutions,” wrote Fotios Pasiouras of MBS School of Business in France, who worked with Lucey on <a href="https://icmaif.soc.uoc.gr/Year/2018/papers/paper_3_209.pdf">a conference paper</a> from 2018.</p>



<p>Others offered a different opinion: “I think it’s widely understood in academia that many editors follow similar practices. Singling out one person – Brian in this case – as a scapegoat strikes me as unfair,” wrote Klaus Grobys of the University of Vaasa in Finland.</p>



<p>Until he parted ways with the publisher, Lucey helped coordinate Elsevier’s <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/subject/finance/journals-ecosystem">Finance Journals Ecosystem</a>, which allows participating journals to suggest transferring a rejected manuscript to another journal in the system without the need for resubmission and the associated cost. That system, and the editors involved, came under fire last year when a preprint suggested <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5056074">it might facilitate citation stacking</a> as a way to boost journal impact factors. The analysis in the preprint also suggested a citation ring involving Elsevier editors could be at work, according to the authors.</p>



<p>Lucey referred us to a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5056074">rebuttal</a> uploaded to the same preprint server that he and several other editors had written, and said most claims in the paper were “wrong” and “most of the interpretations were ungrounded in analysis.”</p>

<p>The flagship journal of the Royal Historical Society has retracted a paper positing that British and Canadian soldiers committed “scores” of prisoner executions against German forces during World War I. The move followed an investigation for plagiarism.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0080440125000015">The article</a>, written by historian Alex J. Kay of the University of Potsdam in Germany,&nbsp; was published online in <em>Transactions of the Royal Historical Society </em>in early February. On February 19, the co-editors of the journal received a complaint that Kay’s article shared similarities with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0968344510376466">a 2010 article</a> by Brian Feltman, a historian at Georgia Southern University, in Statesboro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal&nbsp; looked into the claims and identified several passages that “appeared to follow this source too closely in argument, content, and style, with insufficient acknowledgement,” according to a statement the Royal Historical Society shared with Retraction Watch. The group then shared the passages with external editors, who agreed with the initial findings.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133769"></span>



<p>“Following a detailed review, the editors, together with three independent and experienced journal editors, identified passages of the article which followed this source too closely in argument, content and style, without sufficient acknowledgement/reference,” the August 29 <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/transactions-of-the-royal-historical-society/article/more-prussian-than-the-prussian-battlefield-prisoner-killing-by-british-and-canadian-forces-on-the-western-front-19141918-retraction/70E0B1DB570041BBEA181336E684562B#article">retraction notice</a> states. Kay “strongly disagrees with this decision,” the notice adds.</p>



<p><em>Transactions </em>pointed to the “similarities in sentence structure, phrasing and interpretation” in various passages. Kay told us these were “all descriptive in nature; they were neither analytical nor related to conclusions or hypotheses.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kay’s work claimed to be “the first study directly to compare the actions of the British and the Canadians, the Empire’s two largest armies on the western front,” he wrote in the published paper, and, unlike Feltman’s work, to draw upon unit diaries and after-action reports. Kay cited Feltman’s work throughout — seven times in the text itself, 12 times in the footnotes — and believes that the journal’s motive for retraction may be political.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One senior colleague in Germany, far from being surprised by the journal&#8217;s actions, suggested immediately that it was likely a political decision due to the subject of British war crimes during either of the world wars still being a very touchy subject in the U.K.,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The editors reject any suggestion that the retraction was political,” the Royal Historical Society’s statement reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kay told us he learned of the complaint on April 1 in an email from the Royal Historical Society and <em>Transactions</em>, signed by the journal’s co-editors. The email included information on plagiarism as <a href="https://publicationethics.org/media/124/download?attachment">defined</a> by the Committee on Publication Ethics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even <em>Transactions’ </em>own accusation didn’t make this claim,” Kay told us. He expected that, <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/flowchart/plagiarism-published-article">under COPE guidelines</a>, the journal would have offered Kay the opportunity to correct the article. But Kay said the journal didn’t offer him the opportunity to make any corrections. “It was thus in breach of the guidelines it cited itself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cambridge University Press, which publishes the journal, “maintains a fixed version of record for all the journals it publishes. Dr. Kay was informed that the only remedies available therefore were a separate correction or a retraction. The former was neither feasible nor appropriate in this case,” the Royal Historical Society said in its statement.</p>



<p>“<em>Transactions</em> never explained why this was,” Kay added.</p>



<p>The retraction notice also gave dual submission as a reason for retraction: “At the time of its submission to <em>Transactions</em>, the article was submitted to another journal, contrary to the declaration made by the author at the time of submission.” But Kay told us that he submitted his manuscript to <em>Transactions </em>only after having received no response to his follow-up message to the first journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source of the original complaint requested anonymity and was not part of the journal’s investigation process, <em>Transactions’ </em>co-editors said.</p>

<p>Editors of a materials journal have resigned six years after the title was purchased by a publisher based in Canada, claiming the company “multiplied the number of publications while increasing prices at the expense of quality.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.iieta.org/Journals/RCMA"><em>Revue des Composites et des Matériaux Avancés</em></a> (<em>RCMA</em>) was published by Lavoisier, a French firm, until late 2018. It was then <a href="https://www.iieta.org/ojs/index.php/RCMA/about#:~:text=Focus%20and%20Scope,Peer%20Review%20Statement">purchased</a> by the <a href="https://www.iieta.org/">International Information and Engineering Technology Association</a> (IIETA) “without anyone being informed,” former editor-in-chief <a href="https://cv.hal.science/franciscollombet">Francis Collombet</a> wrote in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RCMA-resignation-email-5jan2026.pdf">a January 5 resignation email</a> signed by 22 other board members. </p>



<p>The resignation continues: “We, the members of the <em>RCMA</em> editorial board, can no longer serve as a guarantee for IIETA, which, by buying up quality journals, has multiplied the number of publications while increasing prices at the expense of quality.”</p>



<span id="more-133788"></span>



<p>Collombet, an emeritus professor at Toulouse University in France, had been editor-in-chief of the journal since 2017. Of the 22 others who resigned, <a href="https://archive.is/Oji0a/again?url=https://www.iieta.org/Journals/RCMA/Editorial%2520Board">all but two</a> were affiliated with institutions in France. The four editors <a href="https://www.iieta.org/Journals/RCMA/Editorial%20Board">still listed</a> on the journal’s website come from universities in China, Turkey, South Africa and Uzbekistan. The other editor-in-chief, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9227-0029">Changlong Wang</a>, a professor at Hebei University of Engineering in China, also remains on the journal’s masthead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collombet told Retraction Watch he did not contact Wang “nor any of the board members that IIETA appointed without consulting me” regarding the resignation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their resignation email, the former editors say a <a href="https://www.iieta.org/Journals/RCMA/Archive/Vol-29-No-5-2019">2018 special issue</a> covering a conference was the first produced by IIETA instead of Lavoisier. “This was the last time we were able to produce an issue of RCMA that made sense from a scientific and ethical point of view,” Collombet wrote. Since then, the editors have not had access to peer reviews, he said in the email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have never been asked to review anything,” Collombet told us.</p>



<p>Andrew Zhang, the managing editor at <em>RCMA </em>and <a href="https://www.iieta.org/ojs/index.php/IJHT/about/editorialTeam">several</a> <a href="https://www.iieta.org/ojs/index.php/I2M/about/editorialTeam">other</a> IIETA journals, responded to our questions, including about access to peer reviews, with a statement:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The review work has always been carried out by the editorial board, and the number of articles we publish is relatively small, which can be easily confirmed on our website. We also keep the APC low in order to support the journal’s ongoing operation. At the same time, we are working to fill editorial board vacancies, with the Co-EiC ensuring that regular publication continues as usual.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>RCMA</em> is one of seven journals IIETA purchased from Lavoisier, which was a result of the French publisher’s <a href="https://actualitte.com/article/22450/droit-justice/l-editeur-scientifique-lavoisier-demande-une-procedure-de-sauvegarde">financial difficulties</a>, <em>Actualitte</em> reported at the time. <em>RCMA </em>is the third journal from which the editorial board resigned en masse after changing hands from Lavoisier to IIETA. It joins our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">Mass Resignations List</a> as number 50, including 7 from 2025.</p>



<p>Computer scientist <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> was on the editorial board of the journal <em>Ingénierie des Systèmes d&#8217;Information</em>, another IIETA journal formerly published by Lavoisier. The editorial board resigned en masse in 2019 in protest of the acquisition, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ISI-resignation-26-sept-2019.pdf">an email we have seen</a>. Since then, he and his colleague <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Ophelie.Fraisier-Vannier/">Ophélie Fraisier-Vannier</a> <a href="https://themeta.news/linvasion-des-profanateurs-de-revue/">have been investigating</a> the Lavoisier-turned-IIETA journals and have documented trends in author affiliations toward institutions primarily in India, China and Iraq, and increases in publication volume and article processing fees. They will present their results at the World Conference on Research Integrity in May.</p>



<p>Fraisier-Vannier, a computer science professor at Toulouse University, shared stats specific to <em>RCMA</em>, including a more-than-doubling in annual publication volume since 2018, from 22.6 in the years 2001-2017 to 55.3 each year since 2018.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="270" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-1024x270.png" alt="" class="wp-image-133789" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-1024x270.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-300x79.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-768x203.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>RCMA publication volume by year, courtesy of Ophélie Fraisier-Vannier</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fraisier-Vannier told us before IIETA bought the journal in 2018, most — 85 percent — of the authors who published in <em>RCMA </em>had affiliations with French institutions. Since the journal changed hands, only 7 percent of published articles have been from researchers working in that country, with over two-third of the articles coming from Iraq, Algeria and India, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/la-revue-francaise-de-reference-en-matiere-d-intelligence-artificielle-est-elle-passee-sous-controle-chinois-7419089"><em>RadioFrance</em> covered</a> resignations at <em>Artificial Intelligence Review, </em>another Lavoisier journal bought by IIETA. Thirty-seven of its editors, including its editor-in-chief, resigned after the new publisher changed an already published issue to include three articles with authors at Chinese institutions, according to <em>RadioFrance</em>.<br></p>



<p>Last year, researchers <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/14766415">used Oxbridge Publishing House, Ltd</a>. to examine journal buyout trends. They noted the publisher bought journals indexed in Web of Science — as <em>RCMA</em> is — and scaled up publication volumes and costs while lowering academic standards, the researchers said. <a href="https://themeta.news/linvasion-des-profanateurs-de-revue/"><em>The Meta News</em> reported</a> in October journals are sold for anywhere up to half a million dollars.</p>
