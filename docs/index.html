                <p>Calcium imaging is only an indirect readout of neuronal activity via fluorescence signals. To estimate the true underlying firing rates of these neurons, methods for &#8220;spike inference&#8221; have been developed. They are useful to denoise calcium imaging data and make them more interpretable. A few years ago, I developed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5">CASCADE</a>, a supervised method for spike inference based on deep networks. I have been been <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">updating and maintaining CASCADE</a> ever since, and this maintenance work has been a starting point for several collaborations and friendly interactions during the last years (for example, check out this recent preprint on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.17.603957v1">spike inference from spinal cord neurons</a>).</p>

<p>Originally, the CASCADE algorithm was trained on a ground truth database that consisted primarily of recordings with GCaMP6. However, how will the algorithm perform on new indicators like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05828-9">GCaMP8</a>, with its much faster rise times? To address this question, I now trained CASCADE models on GCaMP8 ground truth and evaluated whether these models performed better than previous models. The short answer is &#8211; the retrained models performed clearly better:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="1024" height="625" data-attachment-id="7784" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2024/08/22/spike-inference-with-gcamp8-new-pretrained-models-available/figure-1-for-blog-august-2024-2/" data-orig-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/figure-1-for-blog-august-2024-2.png" data-orig-size="1290,788" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Figure 1 for blog August 2024-2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/figure-1-for-blog-august-2024-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/figure-1-for-blog-august-2024-2.png?w=640" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://gcamp6f.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/figure-1-for-blog-august-2024-2.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7784" style="width:497px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>I&#8217;m currently in the process of dissecting this improvement: Is it due to differences in rise times, different non-linearities or other differing properties of the two indicator families? The results of these analyses turned out to be more fascinating than I expected and therefore take more time to understand and analyze, but I&#8217;m planning to have this analysis written up within the next 3-6 months.</p>



<p>In the meantime, however, feel already free to use the new CASCADE models specifically trained with and for GCaMP8 &#8211; they really make predictions better! (And please only apply these models to GCaMP8 data; the previous models are still better for anything with GCaMP6!)</p>



<p>You will find the <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/Pretrained_models/available_models.yaml">new models for CASCADE</a> as usual in the list of available pretrained models. For example, instead of the GCaMP6-trained model <code>Global_EXC_30Hz_smoothing25ms</code>, indicate the GCaMP8-trained model <code>GC8_EXC_30Hz_smoothing25ms_high_noise</code> to infer spike rates with the <code>predict()</code> function of CASCADE.</p>



<p>A technical note: These models are pretrained on all available GCaMP8-ground truth, mixing together GCaMP8f, GCaMP8m and GCaMP8s. This procedure results in more robust models due to the larger ground truth database, but absolute inferred spike rates are slightly biased due to the different spike-event fluorescence amplitudes for the three indicators (-30% underestimate for GCaMP8f and GCaMP8m, +60% overestimate for GCaMP8s). In the near future, CASCADE will also include models specific for each of those indicators. These models will probably be slightly less robust but will provide less biased spike rates. However, if you are not specifically interested in very precise absolute spike rates, I would for now recommend the general GCaMP8 models that are already available. They are not only robust and very powerful but also provide a good rough estimate of absolute spike rates.</p>

<p><em>JAMA Pediatrics</em> has retracted a controversial 2023 paper on the incidence of long COVID in children after the authors discovered a raft of “coding” errors in their analysis that greatly underestimated the risk of the condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article – a research letter titled “Post–COVID-19 Condition in Children” – was written by a group of researchers in Canada led by Lyndsey Hahn, of the University of Alberta, in Edmonton. It has been cited eight times, according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, and garnered <a href="https://jamanetwork.altmetric.com/details/154354403">significant attention</a> on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/incidence-of-long-covid-strikingly-low-in-children-alberta-researchers-find-1.6975858">mainstream</a> and social media sites, including by critics who said the authors fatally botched the definition of long COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the authors, the incidence of long covid in kids was “strikingly low”, occurring in just 0.4% of young patients. Symptoms of infection in kids typically resolve within two weeks, they added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But those reassuring findings hinged on several errors in the analysis that made the incidence of long COVID in children look less than a third of what the researchers should have reported.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129866"></span>



<p>Per the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2822489">retraction notice</a>, signed by senior author <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/searchresults?author=Piush+J.+Mandhane&amp;q=Piush+J.+Mandhane">Piush Mandhane</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Since publication, we have identified methodological (analytical) errors in our original report that impacted our estimate of the prevalence of post–COVID-19 condition (PCC) in children and adolescents and our reported associations between pre- and post–COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One coding error led to the miscategorization of children for whom data were missing to be considered asymptomatic. Another error led to the exclusion of 15 children because of a mistaken date cut-off.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In addition, we originally reported a study sample of children between 8 and 13 years of age. We subsequently identified participants with COVID-19 (cases) who were recruited between 1 and 7.49 years and 14.5 and 19 years of age. These participants were included in the original PCC analysis. We had concluded that the incidence of PCC was 0.4% (1/271). In correcting these errors, we found that the incidence of PCC was 1.4% (4/286).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The researchers also identified coding errors affecting their analysis of symptoms before and after infection, and in the duration of fevers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In correcting these errors, we found that pre–COVID-19 headache, fever, and fatigue were associated with post–COVID-19 symptoms of the same. However, pre–COVID-19 cough, rhinitis, and sore throat were not associated with post–COVID-19 symptoms of the same.</p>

<p>The notice concludes with an apology to the readers and editors of the journal, and states all seven authors agreed with the decision to retract the work.</p>



<p>Blake Murdoch, of the University of Alberta Health Law Institute – which you may recognize as the same university as the authors of the article – was co-author of a January 2024 <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2814314">letter to <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em></a> pointing out several flaws in the Hahn paper. Murdoch told us he and his colleagues were glad to see the retraction. With a caveat: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>No, this does not address the concerns we raised, these are in fact additional errors! Dr. Mandhane&#8217;s retraction note chalked it up to coding errors, which certainly seem to exist, but there is no mention of the basic errors in the manuscript we laid out in our letter, such as changing the definition of PCC between the Introduction and Methods as I discuss in an&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/BlakeMMurdoch/status/1752105777136066715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">old tweet thread</a>. Also, the study authors’ response letter to us seemingly attempted to claim they used components of a definition of long covid that was not published until after the study was completed. …</p>



<p>Perhaps the authors are attempting to save face by focusing on the coding errors rather than the egregious and obvious methodological problems, such as claiming to use the WHO definition of PCC but then inventing their own.</p>

<p>Mandhane did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>The retraction is the latest of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">more than 400</a> involving papers about COVID-19, by our count.</p>

<p><em>There once was a drug named Krebiozen;</em></p>



<p><em>It came from below the horizon.</em></p>



<p><em>It used to be said, by patients now dead,</em></p>



<p><em>Now what do we put our reliance on?</em></p>



<p>&#8211;Limerick attributed to University of Illinois president George Stoddard and University of Illinois provost Coleman Griffith, both of whom would lose their jobs over Krebiozen</p>



<p><em>It is a story that resonates with the present: A 1950s cancer treatment hoax that showed &#8220;charges of conspiracy, elitism, and un-Americanism directed against the educational, scientific, and medical establishment are nothing new; neither is uncritical news coverage of what turns out to be quackery.&#8221; We&#8217;re pleased to share an adapted excerpt from Matthew Ehrlich&#8217;s </em><a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p088117">The Krebiozen Hoax:&nbsp; How a Mysterious Cancer Drug Shook Organized Medicine</a><em>, out today. </em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On March 26, 1951, one of America’s most respected scientists called a meeting at Chicago’s Drake Hotel to make a dramatic announcement: he and a Yugoslavian refugee doctor had found a drug that showed great promise in treating cancer. The scientist was Andrew Ivy, vice president of the University of Illinois (U of I) and designated spokesperson for medical ethics at the Nazi war crimes trials in Nuremberg. Time magazine had gone as far as to pronounce him “the conscience of U.S. science.” Ivy’s Yugoslavian collaborator was Stevan Durovic, said to have discovered the new drug in Argentina after the Nazis forced him to flee his homeland. The drug itself was called Krebiozen, a name that was supposed to connote “cancer suppressor” or “regulator of growth.”</p>



<span id="more-129854"></span>



<p>Krebiozen’s unveiling electrified people around the world. Cancer sufferers and their loved ones deluged the U of I with thousands of calls and messages begging for the drug. One doctor opined that “Krebiozen may be one of the greatest, if not the greatest” discoveries in medical history. But other representatives of organized medicine were immediately suspicious. Virtually none of them had ever heard of Stevan Durovic or his brother Marko, who had followed Stevan to Chicago to promote Krebiozen. Stevan had never published in a scientific journal. The Durovics refused to reveal even to Andrew Ivy precisely how the drug was made, other than that it involved stimulating the immune systems of horses and extracting their blood. Rather than using the conventional means of announcing a new scientific discovery&#8211;through academic venues subject to rigorous peer review&#8211;Ivy had staged the equivalent of a product launch, inviting prominent politicians from Chicago and downstate Illinois along with wealthy benefactors and members of the press. Moreover, although Ivy denied any advance knowledge of it, that meeting had been promoted through a sensational news release: “The battle of medical science to find a cure for cancer achieved its realization today.” Within months, the American Medical Association (AMA) announced that its review of patient case histories had shown Krebiozen to be worthless; later, U of I president George Stoddard asserted that there was no such thing as Krebiozen.</p>



<p>Ivy and the Durovics fought back. They accused the AMA of conspiring with powerful business interests to kill Krebiozen after failing to seize control of it. Illinois lawmakers, some of whom despised Stoddard because of his liberalism and seeming highhandedness, began a lengthy set of hearings on the conspiracy charges and the state university’s possible complicity in suppressing the drug. Stoddard and U of I provost Coleman Griffith were ousted from their administrative posts. In the following years, the controversy spread beyond Illinois as groups formed across the country championing Krebiozen. Movie star Gloria Swanson raised money for the drug; environmentalist Rachel Carson took the medicine to try to fight her cancer. Pro-Krebiozen demonstrators (some wearing badges saying, “I need Krebiozen to live!”) were arrested outside the White House and bodily hauled out of federal offices. Along with members of Congress, they lobbied fiercely for what they called a “fair test” of the drug. Nevertheless, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which had just been granted expanded powers, declared that Krebiozen did nothing to stop cancer. Ivy and the Durovics were indicted on charges of defrauding people who had paid nearly ten dollars per ampule of the drug. After a nine-month trial in Chicago that ended in early 1966, the defendants were acquitted, with the verdicts tainted by accusations of jury tampering. Then Krebiozen sank back below the horizon, to be replaced by other unproven remedies purported to treat cancer and other medical ills.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The Krebiozen saga shows that charges of conspiracy, elitism, and un-Americanism directed against the educational, scientific, and medical establishment are nothing new; neither is uncritical news coverage of what turns out to be quackery. And Krebiozen was in fact quackery: it displayed all the characteristics that historian James Harvey Young identified as being typical of medical fraud. Krebiozen’s sponsors exploited the fear of painful surgery and radiation to promote a nontoxic wonder remedy that they maintained was the scientific key to treating cancer. They insisted that the full details of the drug’s composition and production were a business secret. Proponents of the drug frequently compared Andrew Ivy to Louis Pasteur and other visionaries whose scientific breakthroughs were initially scorned by mainstream medicine. Krebiozen’s backers also charged that the AMA had conspired to crush the drug, charges similar to those previously leveled by such cancer quacks as Norman Baker and Harry Hoxsey. Evidence suggested that after Stevan Durovic was unable to win support for a hypertension medicine that he called “Kositerin,” he rebranded the exact same concoction as a cancer medicine called “Krebiozen”&#8211;a rebranding to adjust to circumstances. The medicine was advertised via such means as a pulp magazine trumpeting the miraculous results that cancer patients had experienced: “Doomed to die&#8211;they still live!” The drug’s supporters declared that they stood for health-care freedom, continually vexing the AMA, the FDA, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In time, according to bank records introduced at the fraud trial, Krebiozen became a multi-million-dollar enterprise.</p>



<p>The Krebiozen story was not bereft of good intentions or good ideas. Before his involvement with the drug, Andrew Ivy was the last person whom anyone would have compared with the likes of Baker or Hoxsey. Instead, he was much more like Linus Pauling, the later proponent of vitamin C as a cancer therapy. Ivy was widely acknowledged as a distinguished scientist with impeccable academic credentials. Few people suggested that he promoted Krebiozen just to get rich, in contrast with Stevan Durovic, who would be accused by the US government of extracting a vast sum of money out of the country and depositing it into overseas accounts. Ivy always would insist that he wanted only to get an impartial test of the hypothesis that he said he had developed out of the existing scientific literature: that people carried within them a natural cancer inhibitor, most likely a hormone produced by the reticuloendothelial system. (Krebiozen’s supporters said that cancer patients needed the drug to manage their conditions just as diabetics needed insulin to manage glucose levels.) Subsequent cancer research has suggested that in some ways, at least, Ivy was on the right track. Scientists have discovered the existence of tumor-suppressor genes. Studies have linked insulin and other hormones to the metabolism of cancer. And one of the most promising new areas of research and treatment&#8211;immunotherapy&#8211;harnesses the body’s natural defenses against cancer.</p>



<p>What is more, Krebiozen users were not all hapless dupes. Many of them had felt abandoned by mainstream medicine or, as in the case of Rachel Carson, had been misled by their doctors about the gravity of their conditions. For them, Krebiozen seemed a rational choice. “I’m not expecting miracles,” said Carson of Krebiozen. “As far as I’ve been able to learn it will do no harm, so what do I have to lose?” If people subsequently decided that the drug did not work for them (as turned out to be the case with Carson), they simply could stop taking it. Other cancer patients and their loved ones were convinced that Krebiozen was the one thing keeping them alive.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In the end, though, Krebiozen turned out to be a hoax, regardless of whether it was planned as such. The medicine always would remain a secret remedy that was never scientifically shown to be effective. Stevan Durovic blocked efforts by federal agencies to witness the drug’s manufacture from start to finish. Patient records intended to demonstrate Krebiozen’s efficacy never met the standards set by the NCI to justify a clinical test of the drug. Eventually, Durovic and Ivy would alienate some of their most steadfast allies after they repeatedly failed to uphold their promises for Krebiozen. Still, the hoax persisted for years&#8211;so many people wanted so fervently to believe that the drug worked.</p>

<p>A physiology journal has retracted two papers after an institutional investigation found a heart researcher falsified data and figures in the articles.</p>



<p>A committee at the Ohio State University found <a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/internal-medicine/govindasamy-ilangovan-phd">Govindasamy Ilangovan</a>, an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at the school, <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007_RET">falsified figures </a>and <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00395.2006_RET">reused</a> data, according to the retraction notices published in <em>Heart and Circulatory Physiology, </em>a journal of the American Physiological Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two papers, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00395.2006">Heat shock protects cardiac cells from doxorubicin-induced toxicity by activating p38 MAPK and phosphorylation of small heat shock protein 27</a>,” and “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007">HSP27 regulates p53 transcriptional activity in doxorubicin-treated fibroblasts and cardiac H9c2 cells: p21 upregulation and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest</a>,” first appeared nearly 20 years ago. They have received 132 citations in total, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The notices detail how Ilangovan repurposed and relabelled Western blots from both published and unpublished works. One of the figures also was “inaccurate” due to “addition of false bands” in a Western blot, but the notice did not explicitly attribute the problems with the figure to Ilangovan.</p>



<span id="more-129837"></span>



<p>Anonymous commenters posted their <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/116BFBC578099B09D10B777DC40ECF">concerns</a> on PubPeer about Western blot bands in both papers. Elisabeth Bik built on one such comment by <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/30837B45AD3BECCB0774FC414D201B">pointing out</a> “identical” and “remarkably similar” lanes of in multiple Western blot figures.</p>



<p>One of the papers received a <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007_COR">corrigendum</a> in 2021 over a figure “published incorrectly” in the original paper. The investigation found that Ilangovan falsified the updated figure in the corrigendum, and the original “was inaccurate because of the reuse and relabeling” of a Western blot. Ilangovan did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ohio State requested the two retractions, Chris Booker, the university’s director of media and public relations, told Retraction Watch. A spokesperson for the journal declined to comment on the retractions due to “confidentiality policies and privacy considerations.”</p>



<p>The university has also requested the retraction of one additional article and is waiting for the journal to respond, Booker told Retraction Watch, but did not specify which article. The only other article of Ilangovan’s with comments on PubPeer is “<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05C0671222DAAB88141BC447719CA6">Heat shock factor-1 knockout enhances cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and multidrug transporter (MDR1) gene expressions to attenuate atherosclerosis</a>” in <em>Cardiovascular Research</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The research misconduct process at Ohio State includes concurrence by university officials and an appeal by the respondent. We cannot comment further until the process is complete,” he said.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/ardemp/status/1748087857414361289">In a post on Twitter</a>, he compiled a list of 13 rules on how to do science. I strongly agreed with some aspects, disagreed with others (after all, Ardem is a scientist in a slightly different field), and felt inspired to share some thoughts about his list. I&#8217;m writing these comments also because I&#8217;m curious what I will think about my current ideas in 10 or 20 years from now. Here&#8217;s the list:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-eef9b06f222a259eeeca85df570a8e49">1. Don&#8217;t be too busy (Rule #1: No excuses. If you&#8217;re too busy, you&#8217;re not being creative).</h4>
</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;d subscribe to this statement 100%.</p>



<p>As a PhD student, I had only few fixed responsibilities. Every couple of months, I started a new side-project, learned a completely new experimental technique, a new programming language, read about a new field of computational neuroscience, etc. 7 years ago, <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/news-events/articles/news.html?news=362">I gave an interview</a> about this creative process for my science. I believe that these deep dives into unknown territory are necessary for creativity. Creativity is often a combination of two influences from two different fields; in the simplest case, it&#8217;s just the application of a certain domain to another &#8211; let&#8217;s say, the use of a fancy cooking technique for the improvement of an immunohistochemistry method. Such a knowledge transfer requires not only focused work on the target method (immunohistochemistry), but also a deep knowledge about the other field (fancy cooking), which requires time, an exploratory spirit &#8211; and an appreciation for the fact that time spent understanding one domian can always be beneficial for another domain.</p>



<p>I noticed for myself that the available time that I have for such digressions became less once I became a PI, and it will become worse over time in the future. But I hope to maintain conditions in the future that won&#8217;t prevent me from staying creative!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-45635c6ba888cfce6eb7b4991ea6a5c5">2. Learn to say no (related to #1).</h4>
</blockquote>



<p>That&#8217;s a very commonly given advice, but few people seem to follow it. &#8220;Saying no&#8221; is not only about focusing on one&#8217;s own projects and tasks, but also about saying no to the inner voices and the peer pressure. <em>You need to publish in Nature.</em> No, you don&#8217;t; don&#8217;t lose yourself while trying. <em>You need to finish your PhD with 30.</em> No, everybody at their own pace! <em>You need to have &gt;3 PhD students. </em>No, one may be just enough for some situations. <em>You need to become a professor within 5 years.</em> No, you don&#8217;t. Life outside academia has many things to offer.</p>



<p>For some people, learning &#8220;no&#8221; only seems applicable to requests from other people. But learning to say &#8220;no&#8221; to the internal voices &#8211; which are often only the internalized voices of other people, be it peers, parents or professors &#8211; can be even more important to free the mental resources for doing creative work and for doing real science.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I don&#8217;t fully agree with that one for my field of science. In basic systems neuroscience, the relevant question is &#8220;how does the brain work&#8221;, and it cannot be approached within 5-10 years. In the meantime, from my own perspective, it seems to make more sense to find small islands of mechnistic understanding and curious observations (for example, I could pick <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan3846">behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8">centripetal integration in astrocytes</a> as starting point phenomena) and continue to work from there bit by bit, even though it&#8217;s not yet clear how these questions can be answered within 10 years.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>That&#8217;s good advice! I should do that more often.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Very good advice again.</p>



<p>I think it is very beneficial to invest a lot of energy trying to kill a project as early as possible. For example, trying to find a critical flaw in a conceptual idea before implementing it in a tedious series of experiments, and then realizing that the data cannot be analyzed properly.</p>



<p>For example, a typical situation at the beginning of an experimental systems neuroscience project is the design of a behavioral task for an animal. Will it be possible to extract the desired mental states from the acquired data, or will these states be confounded by movement or arousal of the animal? These are questions that need to be considered before, not after the experiment.</p>



<p>It happened to me already 3 times that I stopped my main scientific project (1x during my PhD, 1x during my postdoc, 1x as junior PI) because I convinced myself by theoretical arguments or by some analyses that it would not work out. And it happens much more often for smaller project.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m very skeptical about this piece of advice. Maybe I&#8217;ll think differently in 20 years. But at the moment, I have the impression that those who stay in a field and try to figure out the little details are my real scientific heros. If you&#8217;ve found a real effect, you should go for it fully and not drop it for the newest hot stuff. Otherwise, one risks joining a new field where the open questions only seem interesting from outside, the typical &#8220;hype train&#8221;.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-dc59c03dc8ecfb05a9cd2a31148ce7e9">7. Ask for help &#8211; don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel.</h4>
</blockquote>



<p>As somebody who built several microscopes and data analysis pipelines from scratch, I can agree only very reluctantly. I learnt so much from reinventing these wheels! And I would be a much worse scientist without.</p>



<p>I still remember my first year of physics studies, when I did not know of any sort of theoretical neuroscience. Back then, I tried to develop a weird form of math that can deal with neuronal connectivity and dynamics. Only a year later or two, I stumbled across Dayan &amp; Abbott&#8217;s famous <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262041997/theoretical-neuroscience/">Theoretical Neuroscience</a> and learned that matrix algebra is a great and existing tool for that. But I still wonder what kind of math I would have come up with if I&#8217;d been more gifted for it and if I&#8217;d had more time without Dayan &amp; Abbott.</p>



<p>However, I also noticed that several extremely skilled scientist-tinkerers like <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/systems-neuroscience/why-and-how-we-need-to-professionalize-neuroscience/">Jakob Voigt</a> and Spencer Smith (I was unable to find his blog post on this topic) turned into advocates of professional infrastructures later during their careers, advocating against the repeated reinvention wheels.</p>



<p>I still cannot decide whether the established black box button-press infractructure are more error-prone, or the code written from scratch by a very smart PhD student. From the perspective of a PhD student, it is probably better to write and build everything from scratch, because you learn more and know what is going on. From the perspective of the PhD student&#8217;s supervisor, however, it is better if an existing and tested infrastructure is used, because otherwise there is no efficient way to make sure that the results obtained by the PhD student are valid. Maybe these two different perspective are also the reason why some people change their mind once they are professors.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I have a hard time agreeing with this rule. My best collaborations have been with people who were technically stronger than me. Collaborations with people who have only limited understanding and, in particular, limited appreciation for the skills that I bring into a collaboration, can be quite painful.

<p>I noticed that senior PIs often do not have anybody (not a single person!) who tells them with all honesty when they are wrong. If such a condition is combined with a narcisstic personality of the senior PI, things can become really bad and embarrasing. I do not yet know how exactly to prevent this from happening, because it seems to happen to the best scientists, and it seems particulary common for men (less so for women according to my observations).</p>

<p>I also think that reduction of anxiety is indeed important (related to #1 and #2). But I don&#8217;t have a recipe on how to reach such a state. From my own and very limited experience as an observer, the level of anxiety seems to be relatively stable for a given person within academia, independent of the position. I happen to be one of those persons who are not very anxious in general. The reason for this lack of anxiety is maybe that I&#8217;m not afraid of leaving academia, because I&#8217;m sure I would find another interesting job as well, and because my family does not have any ties with academia. But first of all, it&#8217;s probably a personality trait which I owe primarily to my genes and to my parents &#8211; and I&#8217;m grateful for that!</p>

                Air temperatures in July 2024 were fractionally cooler than in July 2023, probably because of a waning El Niño. But don’t expect things to be much cooler in coming years.

<p>When Sam Payne reviewed a paper in March for Elsevier’s <em>BioSystems</em>, he didn’t expect to come across a figure he had created in his research. He quickly scrolled through the rest of the paper to find more figures, all copied from his work.</p>



<p>“It’s so blatant,” Payne, an <a href="https://biology.byu.edu/sam-payne-lab">associate professor of biology</a> at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, <a href="https://x.com/byu_sam/status/1765837386158641173">posted on X</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the journal rejected the paper at Payne’s recommendation, he worried the authors would try to publish elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I had imagined they would just keep submitting it to new journals until it got accepted, because it was so brazenly plagiarized that they clearly didn&#8217;t care,” Payne told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Months later, Payne’s worry was justified. The <a href="https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.202300351">paper</a>, by researchers at First Moscow State Medical University, in Russia, appeared in Wiley’s <em>Proteomics </em>in May.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129834"></span>



<p>While the figures are obviously copied from his work, Payne says the text of the article also has been lifted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It seems like what happened is they just took sections of the manuscript and pushed it into an AI chatbot and said ‘summarize this for me,’ and then it came back with a reworded version,” Payne told us.</p>



<p>The corresponding author, Tatyana Degtyarevskaya, did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Payne’s <a href="https://x.com/byu_sam/status/1817943851673227317">posts</a> on X about the whole experience received over 3 million views.&nbsp; They spurred Wiley to “immediately” initiate an investigation in accordance with Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines, said a spokesperson for Wiley, who told us the publisher will retract the article.</p>



<p>“This calls for a much better peer review system. Like we have to do better. We have to check figures for plagiairism [sic] &#8211; as has been strongly advocated for by [Elisabeth Bik]. I know it will be hard. But this appears to be our reality,” Payne <a href="https://x.com/byu_sam/status/1817946739438911635">tweeted</a> in the thread.</p>



<p>Payne said he is brainstorming ways journals could combat chatbot-aided plagiarism, when it’s not obvious the text is a direct match: “This will be happening a lot I think, unless [they] do some real serious effort to prevent it.”</p>



<p>Update, 8/16/24, 1800 UTC: The plagiarizing paper has <a href="https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.202470135">now been retracted</a>. Most of the authors say they had nothing to do with the paper: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The above article, published online on May 3, 2024 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the journal Editor-in-Chief, Lucie Kalvodova; and Wiley-VCH GmbH. The retraction has been agreed due to a major unattributed overlap between the figures and figure legends of this article (Figures 2–7) and another article previously published elsewhere by a different group of authors [1]. Such publishing practice is against the journal&#8217;s policy and Wiley&#8217;s Best Practice Guidelines on Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics. The co-authors, I. Popova, T. Degtyarevskaya, D. Babaskin, and A. Vokhmintsev, stated that they did not participate in the writing and submission of the article and gave no consent for publication. E. Savelyeva remained unresponsive.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Marine biologist Jorge Fontes captured the winning photograph. Jorge works at Okeanos-UAc, Institute of Marine Sciences, and is involved in a project to study the impact of fishing on the largest animals in the oceans.  &#8220;The world&#8217;s largest fish, the whale shark, is a gentle giant found in warm tropical and subtropical waters globally,&#8221; explains Fontes. &#8220;It likes to eat plankton, which it filters through its wide mouth. During warm summers, many adult whale sharks gather near the Azores. However, because these waters are not very productive in the summer, there isn&#8217;t much plankton for them to eat. Instead, the slow-moving whale sharks feed on snipefish, herded into tight groups at the surface by large schools of speedy bluefin and smaller tropical tunas, leading to a feeding frenzy. With the baitfish gathered together, the whale sharks use powerful suction to fill their huge mouths with food. This feeding partnership between sharks and tunas is rare elsewhere but common in these islands when both are present. To better understand this unique behaviour and the impact of local tuna fisheries, we have tagged whale sharks with advanced trackers (equipped with accelerometers, cameras, and sensors to measure location, pressure, and temperature)&#8221;. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryan Wagner, a conservation biologist in the School of Biological Sciences at Washington State University, won best in category for &#8220;Research in action&#8221;. &#8220;A single mosquito bite can kill a Kiwikiu, one of the most endangered birds in the world, with only 130 remaining. Following the introduction of mosquitoes in the 1800s, which carry deadly avian malaria, native Maui birds have found refuge on the high, cold slopes of the Haleakala volcano. However, as climate change warms the islands, mosquitoes have reached previously inaccessible elevations, killing birds. In 2024, the Maui Forest Birds Recovery Project (MFBRP) made the difficult decision to catch several pairs of Kiwikiu to create a captive population. As shown in the photo, medicine administered by ornithologists provides a boost of electrolytes and protein to strengthen the bird for a quick helicopter flight to the Maui Bird Conservation Center. There, it will be treated for malaria and join a captive breeding program to help save the species from extinction&#8221;, explains Ryan. </span></p>

<p>The runner-up of the ‘Research in action’ category was Brandon Güell, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Florida International University. High phosphorus levels from agricultural and stormwater runoff is harming the Everglades&#8217; unique wildlife by affecting plant diversity and triggering algae blooms. To address this issue, the state and federal governments are funding the largest ecosystem restoration project in the world. Here Güell&#8217;s colleague, Dr. Janelle Goeke, is conducting research to understand the role of fauna in phosphorus dynamics and exploring the potential of managing fish populations as a restoration tool.</p>

<p>The winner of the &#8216;Relationships in nature&#8217; category captured an Arctic Skua mimicking the flight pattern of a Black-legged Kittiwake in an attempt to steal it&#8217;s fish. The photo was submitted by Alwin Hardenbol, a postdoctoral researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Alwin comments, &#8220;This behavior, where one animal deliberately takes food from another, was observed from a boat near Vardö, Norway. Arctic Skuas often exhibit this type of behavior, known as kleptoparasitism, in large numbers. While in Norway, I observed Humpback whales bringing fish to the surface, which the Kittiwakes and other gulls caught. The Skuas then attempted to steal the fish from them.

<p>Martha Charitonidou, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Ioannina, submitted the runner-up for this category. &#8220;Unlike the majority of Ophrys orchids, which produce flowers imitating female insects, Helen&#8217;s Bee orchid is the only species in this genus known to use shelter mimicry as its pollination strategy,&#8221; Charitonidou explains. &#8220;Helen&#8217;s Bee orchid is one of the most easily recognizable members of the genus Ophrys due to its large flowers with a specialised, burgundy-coloured petal (labellum), which in the bee visible spectrum looks like a black hole on the ground that a bee would use to seek shelter. As shown in this photo, male Eucerini bees can be seen crawling into Helen Bee orchid flowers in search of shelter during early morning or late evening hours.&#8221;</p>

A concerned freeloader: A non-pollinating fig wasp uses its specialised ovipositor to deposit eggs inside a fig. Attribution: Abhijeet Bayani</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dr Abhijeet Bayani, a biologist from the Indian Institute of Science, captured the winning image for the &#8216;Life close-up&#8217; category. Fig trees, crucial in tropical ecosystems as they provide food for many animals throughout the year, have evolved to have flowers inside their fruit. The only way a fig can be pollinated is with the help of minuscule fig wasps, which burrow inside and lay their eggs within. The relationship between figs and fig wasps is highly interdependent &#8211; both rely on each other to complete their life cycles, making it a classic example of co-evolution. The female wasps enter the fig, lay eggs, pollinate it and eventually die within the fig.  Once the eggs hatch, the male wasps mate with the newly hatched female wasps and create an exit tunnel for the females to leave and locate new figs. Some fig wasps are essential for pollinating the figs, while others, like the non-pollinating wasp captured in Dr Abhijeet Bayani&#8217;s winning photo, have evolved a specialised ovipositor to cheat the fig, which is used to bore through the surface of the fruit from the outside and deposit eggs inside. Their offspring then develop inside the safety of the fig, seemingly without benefiting the fig tree itself.</p>

Inside a dinosaur bone: Unlocking the life history of Megapnosaurus. Attribution: Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Professor Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, a palaeontologist from the University of Cape Town, submitted the runner-up for &#8216;Life close-up&#8217;. Using a microscope, Chinsamy-Turan demonstrates how fossilised bones can provide valuable information about long-extinct species. Chinsamy-Turan explains, &#8220;When viewed under a petrographic microscope, this image of a thin section of a femur of Megapnosaurus, a predatory dinosaur from Southern Africa, reveals important information about the biology of this ~190-million-year-old animal. The large black areas once contained blood vessels, nerves, and other connective tissue, while the smaller black specks are the spaces in which bone cells were once located. After death, organic tissue decomposes, and the empty spaces are infilled with sediment and minerals. The vibrant colours visible in the image provide insight into the organisation of the apatite, which is the mineral component of bone that survives fossilisation. In life, collagen and apatite are intimately associated, and although collagen is no longer present, the overall arrangement of the apatite suggests that the bone was deposited rapidly.&#8221; Studying the microstructure of fossilised bone can provide valuable insight into the life history of dinosaurs and other extinct vertebrates. This can include details about the sex, growth rate, presence of disease, and the potential impact of environmental factors on the growth of the extinct animal.</p>

<p>A team of physicists has retracted a paper from <em>Science</em> after they discovered mistakes in their data and statistical analysis when following up on their work.</p>



<p>The paper “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau1949">A room-temperature single-photon source based on strongly interacting Rydberg atoms</a>” published in 2018, garnered 117 citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Of these, 97 citations came after the authors corrected the paper in 2020 to adjust for updated calibrations, which they said did not affect the conclusions of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This correction was unrelated to the reasons for retraction, said corresponding author <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/press/experts/Prof.-Tilman-Pfau/">Tilman Pfau</a>, a professor of physics at the University of Stuttgart in Germany.</p>

<p>The now-retracted paper described a way to generate single photons on demand at room temperature rather than in extremely cold conditions. The approach could have “various applications in quantum information processing and communication,” the authors wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the retraction notice, after a recent internal reevaluation of the data, the authors “detected mistakes in data filtering and statistical calculations in one of the study’s figures.” The authors reevaluation of the data does not support the study’s conclusions, hence the retraction, the notice stated.</p>



<p>The authors found the errors in their previous data analysis while working on an update to the experiment, but with more advanced equipment, Pfau said.</p>



<p>“While analyzing this new data we realized that we did subtle mistakes in the analysis and the filtering of the ‘old’ data,” Pfau told Retraction Watch. He added that the experiment’s low coincidence rate, an important factor in quantum analysis, was “not enough to draw conclusions with sufficient confidence in retrospect.” All authors agree with the retraction, he said.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Science </em>said it’s encouraging “to see examples like this where authors uncover an error and work quickly to correct the record.” <a href="https://www.science.org/content/author/holden-thorp-phd">Holden Thorp</a>, the editor in chief of the <em>Science</em> family of journals, has previously <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade3742">expressed his desire</a> to change the retraction process, such as implementing a two-step process to speed up retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pfau said his team handled the case as transparently as possible: “In order to avoid such mistakes in the future we will intensify our training in the statistical analysis of data and will also publish alongside with future papers, the original data and the analyzing scripts.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/bridging-the-gap-ruth-dobson">Bridging the Gap: Ruth Dobson</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We are back with our series Bridging the Gap! For each post, we are interviewing women in neuroscience to discuss the gaps and the health inequalities relating to different areas of neuroscience, as well as the exciting new research that is attempting to bridge these gaps. For our new article, we talked with Professor Ruth Dobson, consultant neurologist and researcher at the Wolfson Institute for Population Health, Queen Mary University of London. In our interview, Professor Dobson shared with us her experience working on Multiple Sclerosis and her interest in equality and diversity within this field.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_801428aeba6a4af0b1059001fa663eda~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_774,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Professor Ruth Dobson, consultant neurologist and researcher at the Wolfson Institute for Population Health."></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, with no definitive cure. It is estimated that there are more than 30,000 people with MS in the UK alone, and over 2.8 million people diagnosed worldwide. Disease onset is usually between 20 to 40 years of age and the most common symptoms include, but are not limited to, difficulty walking, fatigue, blurred vision and spasms (</span></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">see our post for MS Awareness week </span></span><u><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/womeninneurouk/p/C6E9jNwtN0N/?locale=nl&hl=af&img_index=1" target="_blank">here</a></span></span></u><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">). Any of these symptoms can occur in relapses or progressively worsen over time; either way, it can significantly impact quality of life. However, it is noteworthy that MS is also a highly heterogeneous disease, with symptoms and health outcomes varying across individuals. For example, in women, MS is three times more prevalent than in men and tends to develop at a younger age, significantly impacting female patients’ lives. Additionally, this disease was considered to affect mostly white people, however studies have suggested that it is more common in Black and Asian individuals than previously thought and it also tends to develop earlier and more aggressively in these populations (1,2). These disparities are driven, not only by genetic and environmental factors, but also by individual and structural social determinants - such as health care access, race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status. Still, little is known about their true effects on MS outcomes and how they potentially contribute to health disparities in MS. It is fundamental to address these issues to understand and treat the different developments of MS and its symptoms in people. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">With her work on multiple sclerosis, Professor Ruth Dobson advocates for the necessity of removing biases in clinical and research practices and collecting real-world data that reflect the diversity of MS patients, their experiences and their unmet needs.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you tell me a bit about your background and your path to studying multiple sclerosis?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I am a clinician and, during my neurology training, I did a PhD looking at multiple sclerosis (MS), investigating why people develop MS and the risks of MS in people without a diagnosis. I think, during this experience, I really caught the ‘bug’ for research; I started really enjoying it and I decided I actually wanted research to be part of my career going forward. However, when I finished my PhD, it was quite hard to combine everything, so I went back to my clinical training, completed it and became a consultant neurologist. I then had the opportunity to move back to research and I have remained in it ever since, even though I still do clinical work. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What research projects are you working on at the moment?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have a few projects, but in particular I am interested in inequalities. In terms of gender-based inequalities, I am working on pregnancy and MS. Multiple Sclerosis does not only affect more females than males, but it also tends to be diagnosed at an earlier age in the former, affecting people when they could be thinking about pregnancy and family planning. So I do quite a bit of work on drug safety and pregnancy and approaches to minimise the harm to both mother and baby. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I also conduct a project on how menopause can impact MS and the causes of MS during the life course. On the other hand, in terms of the wider social determinants of health, I do some research building on my PhD work, but in particular looking at MS in people from different ethnicities and backgrounds. I am interested in exploring the pathways of MS risks, not just in a single population but across multiple ones, investigating how social determinants of health might influence things like diagnosis and access to disease modifying therapy, have an impact on MS outcomes, and look at how the safety profiles of disease modifying therapies may change over time and with the background. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">You mentioned equality. How did you become interested in specifically exploring equality and diversity within MS research?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I work in East London, so diversity is what I see every day in my clinical work. In a way, we are very lucky with MS because we have all of these drugs that can work very well. However, not everyone has equitable access to diagnosis, specifically an early diagnosis, and medication, and that is a really big determinant of long-term health outcomes in all populations. It stems from the fact that someone’s background can be associated with a preconception in clinical care about the likelihood of them having MS, which then impacts downstream. You see it in the clinics, where, in an NHS service that is incredibly strained and struggles massively with capacity, people that had generally good or high social determinants of health were able to advocate for themselves, navigate healthcare services, and access treatments more promptly and report problems. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Looking at research and treatments in MS, what would you say are some of the most impactful disparities?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As mentioned before, I think a lot of disparities actually come down to how easily people can navigate and access the healthcare services and manage to stay in the system. It can be very challenging, especially when you have a disease that may leave very little physical signs but quite a lot of impact. We see again, and again, and again people with MS who visited health services multiple times before receiving a diagnosis, who felt they were not believed or trusted and had to keep banging on the door. So, I would say differences in accessing and navigating the healthcare system influence MS outcomes. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are so many other challenges that people face, but I think that categorising people, according to factors they have potentially no control over, is not always very helpful. Instead, we should try to think more about how the services operate. For example, virtual appointments: for somebody who has low income, or poor access to the internet, and lives in digital poverty, accessing a video appointment is a massive barrier to healthcare. These sort of structural barriers that exist within the NHS may affect one group more than others and impact different health outcomes. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What can mitigate, in terms of research and clinical practices, such disparities?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think we need to understand what the barriers are, and also start from the idea that one single design of healthcare is not going to work for everyone. From a research perspective, we should investigate, using both large data and individual qualitative work, what the structural barriers that people face actually are, how these manifest, what harm they can potentially cause and where they do so along a pathway. It is also important to enter this work with an open mind, without preconceptions of what characteristics can lead people to face barriers, but keeping in mind that they do not act independently. There is an incredibly complex web of different factors and aspects that can also be very situational and depend on the particular condition. Also, in terms of healthcare, I think that, to design services that better address disparities, there should be a range of solutions impacting different factors. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Do you see changes in practices that are moving towards these  directions? And is there anything in particular that you see happening in the field of MS that particularly excites you?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it is very challenging for things to be happening with the NHS being so strained. However, there is an increasing research interest in the role of inequalities in health outcomes. What is interesting and fills me with hope, is the fact that if you go back 5 years, there was almost nothing happening in this area, but now it has become a major research priority and that brings the potential for translation into impact. </span></span></p>

<p>The article, ‘Culturally-informed for designing motorcycle fire rescue: Empirical study in developing country’, <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/14/6/065222/3297649/Culturally-informed-for-designing-motorcycle-fire">published in June in <em>AIP Advances</em></a>, overwhelmingly cites the work of Muhammed Imam Ammarullah, a lecturer at Universitas Pasundan in West Java, Indonesia, sometimes without obvious relevance to the text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An anonymous tipster came across the soon-to-be retracted paper on Google Scholar, then alerted the editors at <em>AIP Advances </em>in June to the strange citation pattern. The journal investigated, but didn’t acknowledge a problem with the excessive citations to Ammarullah’s work in their initial response to the complaint. Instead, they identified issues with six other, unrelated citations, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129814"></span>



<p>During the initial investigation, the publisher found the authors added those six references at the request of a reviewer. The references “do not appear to enrich the discussion of the results presented,” a representative from the journal wrote in an email to the tipster. But the journal found “no clear evidence of coercion to include those references by the part of the reviewer or handling editors,” although the investigation “did reveal gaps” in the journal’s guidelines for including citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we asked about the 53 citations, the publisher said they had decided to pull the paper because they found those citations were also “unrelated to the subject discussed in the text.” The authors have not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Other papers follow the same pattern. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Scientific sleuth</a> Nick Wise has flagged 13 <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/search?q=ammarullah">articles</a> on PubPeer with an unusually high number of citations to Ammarullah’s work “shoehorned” into the text, he said. Of the 13 flagged papers, two authors of two separate papers responded to our questions. Both said an anonymous reviewer added the citations during the review process. </p>



<p>Hamed Nosrati, co-author of “Artificial Intelligence in Regenerative Medicine: Applications and Implications,” <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37754193/">a paper in <em>Biomimetics</em></a> which Wise <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/12C65CFC5C8C69B0350D69BC7791AE#1">flagged</a>, said an ethical specialist at the journal contacted him after Wise’s comment appeared on Pubpeer. According to Nosrati, after a review, an academic editor concluded that the references included didn’t affect the article’s overall readability or main conclusions. </p>



<p>Kuppalapalle Vajravelu, corresponding author of “Effects of Stefan blowing on mixed convection heat transfer in a nanofluid flow with Thompson and Troian slip,” <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10407782.2023.2261626">another paper citing Ammarullah</a>, also <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/06635A5E67B4BA34F7AC9E38693078#1">flagged on PubPeer</a>, said an anonymous reviewer suggested the citations to “improve the quality of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>References can be a “grey area,” the journal’s editor, John Abraham of the University of St. Thomas, said in response to our questions, “because while topic areas may seem different, there are often subtle overlaps that justify inclusion.” Taylor and Francis, the paper’s publisher, said they were looking into the concerns.</p>



<p>Wise doesn’t see a common denominator among the papers that cite Ammarullah’s work without clear relevance. “They’re all different authors, different countries, different institutions,” he said, which could be evidence the common thread is “much deeper and worse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">Citation manipulation</a>, whether <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01532-w">coerced citations</a>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/vendor-offering-citations-purchase-latest-bad-actor-scholarly-publishing">buying citations</a>, or <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-dark-world-of-citation-cartels">citation rings</a> – groups of researchers who agree to cite each other’s work – <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2012/04/10/emergence-of-a-citation-cartel/">isn’t new</a>, but has become easier to detect and attracted more attention recently. Extreme cases demonstrate how far the practice can go. Wise was involved in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-easy-it-fudge-your-scientific-rank-meet-larry-world-s-most-cited-cat">a recent experiment</a> that garnered Larry, a feline, more than 100 citations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ammarullah, who has not responded to our request for comment, has tallied <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XE_oxj0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">more than 1,200 citations</a> since the start of 2023 and is listed as an author on 53 publications in that timeframe. Clarivate’s Web of Science recently named one of his articles published in an MDPI journal <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements/3891">a “hot paper”</a> – a title given to publications that rack up enough citations to place them in the top 0.1% of papers in a particular field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/mysteries-of-psilocybin">Mysteries of Psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                <p><br /></p>
<p>From the rock art found in the Sahara Desert to the mushroom stone statues of Mesoamerican civilizations, artefacts throughout human history suggest that psychoactive mushrooms were used in religious and spiritual ceremonies across different cultures. The earliest proven use of these mushrooms can be traced back to prehistoric times, with evidence found in several archaeological and anthropological contexts. Rock paintings in the Sahara Desert, dating back to around 7000-5000 BCE, depict people with mushrooms sprouting from their bodies, potentially symbolising their ceremonial or ritualistic use. Stone carvings depicting mushrooms discovered in various locations in Central America and Mexico suggest that Mesoamerican civilizations, especially the Maya, used these mushrooms in similar contexts approximately 6000 years later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Spanish chronicles from the 16th century describe &quot;teonanácatl&quot;, Aztec for &quot;god&apos;s flesh,&quot; widely believed to be mushrooms used for healing and spiritualism​. In ancient China, the &quot;Divine Farmer&apos;s Classic of Materia Medica&quot;, an ancient text on agriculture and medicinal plants, references the use of fungi with possible psychoactive properties for similar benefits​. Additionally, Indian sacred texts dating back to 1500 BCE describe a sacred religious drink, Soma, which is believed to contain extracts from psychedelic mushrooms​​. Ironically, despite this long history, research into their therapeutic value is still in its early stages even thousands of years later. These &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; contain a molecule, psilocybin, responsible for the spiritual journey that connects the human to &quot;divine&quot; realms.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chemically named 4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin is metabolised in the body to its active component, psilocin which interacts with the serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2AR) in the brain. Serotonin is an essential neurotransmitter responsible for various activities such as mood regulation, sleep, appetite, social behaviours (sex and aggression), memory, and learning. Psilocin mimics serotonin’s function in the brain and behaves as a partial agonist at serotonin receptors, hence contributing to a psychedelic experience. Due to these effects of psilocybin on mood regulation, research is being conducted on its potential to treat mood disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Several psychological disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, death/disease-related anxiety, depression, treatment-resistant depression, major depressive disorder, smoking, and alcohol and tobacco addiction, are observed to involve dysfunctional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN). The DMN is a network of brain regions active when the brain is at rest or engaged in unfocused tasks such as daydreaming and mind-wandering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Studies conducted to understand the overall effects of psilocybin on the brain show that it &quot;desynchronizes&quot; brain activity, drastically altering the interaction between different brain regions. Psilocybin significantly impacts the DMN and the anterior hippocampus, which alters one’s sense of time, space, and self. Other significantly impacted areas include regions in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, connected to the DMN. This reduced functional connectivity between these regions can persist for weeks and is thought to correlate with increased neuroplasticity, thus contributing to the therapeutic effects of psychedelics.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although clinical trials assessing the efficiency of psilocybin-assisted therapy are limited, a small study among patients with addiction showed promising results. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants who took psilocybin had a significantly lower percentage of heavy-drinking days over 32 weeks compared to those who took a placebo. Additionally, the prevalence of smoking abstinence was 80% at 26 weeks and 67% at 52 weeks for those who received psilocybin. Another study on patients with major depressive disorder found that psilocybin-assisted therapy led to significant and sustained positive effects with minimal adverse events. Moreover, randomised controlled trials on patients with anxiety and related disorders demonstrated that psilocybin improved well-being, life satisfaction, and mood immediately after administration and up to six months post-treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, though psilocybin has been consumed throughout history for its psychedelic effects, current research suggests that it is especially effective in a psychotherapeutic setting, where patients can alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression and addiction due to actual changes in brain connectivity. While these findings are promising, there remains a need for more extensive research to fully understand and harness the potential of psilocybin-assisted therapy.</p>
