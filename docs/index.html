                The funding agency aims to cap “indirect costs” in biomedical research grants. But this behind-the-scenes work is crucial to making research happen.

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sedimentology-cover-feb2025.png"><img decoding="async" width="650" height="854" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sedimentology-cover-feb2025.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131067" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sedimentology-cover-feb2025.png 650w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sedimentology-cover-feb2025-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>The chief editors of the journal <em>Sedimentology</em> have resigned, along with nearly a third of its associate editors, as the society running the title amended its publishing contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The International Association of Sedimentologists (IAS), a scientific society based in Belgium, owns the journal and contracts with Wiley to publish it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAS had run an operating deficit since its 2021-22 fiscal year, and began discussing “legal, financial, and strategic considerations” in October 2023, according to a letter from IAS acting president Daniel Ariztegui to its members. These moves included changes to the handling of manuscripts and copy-editing at <em>Sedimentology</em> and an amendment to the society’s contract with Wiley.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131066"></span>



<p>The journal’s chief editors and many associate editors opposed the changes, and resigned their positions, according to a February 10 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adam-mcarthur-7457a725_calling-all-sedimentologists-below-activity-7294636701442846720-8AuL/">letter</a> Adam McArthur of the University of Leeds posted on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These are quite extraordinary and troubling times in the IAS,” McArthur, one of the resigning editors, wrote in his post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We, like the [contributing editors] who resigned, believe that the move to a Wiley-led model, and the loss of all internal editorial assistance is extremely detrimental to the future of <em>Sedimentology</em>,” the resignation letter stated, citing changes to the role of the journal’s longtime editorial office manager.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter also faulted the IAS leadership for its decision-making process:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>More consultation was appropriate, and a wider base of consent should have been built before actions were taken. Had it been so, the situation where all the Chief Editors for <em>Sedimentology</em> have resigned because they felt that their positions had become untenable would not have arisen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McArthur has not responded to our queries, nor have the four <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241012184521/https://www.sedimentologists.org/about-ias/about-the-association/editors/">former chief editors</a> of the journal.</p>



<p><em>Sedimentology </em>joins our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">Mass Resignations List</a>, which documents walkouts and resignations at nearly two dozen journals since 2023.</p>



<p>Ariztegui responded to the resignations in a February 8 letter to members also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-j-g-reijmer-47921925_the-ias-side-of-things-ugcPost-7295082462672551936-YVt9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAA4i8PMB-MyL-FVAwrEPoG3MwLLDIk4Ssg0">posted on LinkedIn</a>. He referred to “a misunderstanding or misstatement of the facts” in the resignation letter from the associate editors, which he said had been sent by 12 of the journal’s editors. Twenty-six associate editors remain on the journal’s <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13653091/homepage/editorialboard.html">editorial board page</a>, down from 39 on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230715052951/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13653091/homepage/EditorialBoard.html">archived version</a> of the page from 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Sedimentology</em> is not and will not be in the future a ‘Wiley-led’ journal,” Ariztegui wrote. According to his letter, the society’s leadership had voted to amend its contract with Wiley to have the publisher provide “secretarial support” to the journal’s editorial board and run the ScholarOne website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAS owns <em>Sedimentology</em> and appoints all its editors, who are unpaid and operate “without influence from Wiley,” Ariztegui told Retraction Watch in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This fundamental structure remains unchanged,” he wrote to us. “The only modifications involve Wiley handling the transfer of manuscripts to the Chief Editors and managing copy editing post-acceptance—a process aimed at streamlining operations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ariztegui noted another journal the IAS owns, <em>The Depositional Record</em>, operates with a similar model. “The adjustments being made to <em>Sedimentology</em> align with this model while ensuring that IAS remains in full control of editorial decisions,” he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contract between IAS and Wiley comes up for renewal in 2028, and the IAS can give 12 months notice if it decides not to renew, he said. “All changes proposed and approved by the Council of Management, in accordance with the association statutes, have been implemented to address the IAS budget deficit and ensure alignment in the operations of all journals owned by the association,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the editorial office manager, Elaine Richardson, Ariztegui told us she “is not being dismissed,” although McArthur’s LinkedIn post said her position “has been terminated.” She has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are in the process of negotiating a new service agreement, and hopefully she will continue to provide copy-editing services for the IAS,” Ariztegui told us. “This has been clearly communicated in our previous statements.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ariztegui’s letter to IAS members went into more detail on the reasons for changing the role, namely to comply with Belgian and European law on self-employment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also defended the IAS decision-making process as in line with “good governance,” but noted most of <em>Sedimentology</em>’s chief editors stopped engaging in discussions in October 2024, “as they disagreed with the proposed changes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We recognize that communication between the Council of Management and the Associate Editors of <em>Sedimentology</em> could have been more frequent and effective,” Ariztegui told us. “Additionally, adjustments to the management structure may have contributed to communication challenges.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 2017 paper coauthored by Nobel laureate Thomas Südhof has been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “Conditional Deletion of All Neurexins Defines Diversity of Essential Synaptic Organizer Functions for Neurexins,” was published in <em>Neuron </em>in May 2017 and has been cited 145 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00074-1">retraction notice</a>, issued February 11, states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We, the authors of this publication, have decided to retract the paper because we found that the images in Figure 1D and Figure S4B contain aberrations that cannot be explained, and the original data for these figures are missing. Raw data for the other components of the paper are available, and their reanalysis confirmed the conclusions of the paper. We would like to thank M. Schrag for bringing these image aberrations to our attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-131061"></span>



<p>The article was the subject of a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F7C42C356B2E7049FDB68A434EF4F8">lengthy PubPeer thread</a> initiated in April 2024 by Lulu Y. Chen, the paper’s lead author and, at the time, a postdoc in Südhof’s lab at Stanford University. Chen wrote that she “discovered I inadvertently duplicated a panel” in one of the paper’s figures, and she was “posting this finding preemptively.” In the months following, several sleuths, including Elisabeth Bik and Matthew Shrag, noted issues with other figures in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The Transmitter </em><a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/retraction/second-paper-from-lab-of-nobel-prize-winner-to-be-retracted/">reported in August</a> that an update <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/sudhoflab/integrity---pubpeer.html">on Südhof’s website</a> stated the authors had requested a retraction of the article. (Note: Retraction Watch cofounder Ivan Oransky is the editor-in-chief of <em>The Transmitter</em>.) The article has been cited seven times since August.</p>



<p>When <em>Neuron </em>issued the retraction notice this week, Bik posted the text of it, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Of note, the authors&#8217; wording of &#8220;we found&#8221; and &#8220;can not be explained&#8221; seem not reflect what was discussed above on this thread. It is also remarkable that only Dr. Schrag is thanked for bringing this to the authors&#8217; attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction is the second for Südhof. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28erratum+or+correction%29+AND+%28thomas+sudhof%29&amp;filter=datesearch.y_5">Several corrections</a> on his papers have also been issued recently, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nobel-winning-neuroscientist-faces-scrutiny-data-discrepancies-papers"><em>Science </em>reported in May</a>, with many other papers <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Thomas+Sudhof">flagged on PubPeer</a>. A regularly updated <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/sudhoflab/integrity---pubpeer.html">page on Südhof’s website</a> details the concerns and actions taken to investigate.</p>

<p>When scientists face critique of their published work, they should be proactive in responding to the issues and to questions about it from the public and the media, says <em>Science </em>editor-in-chief Holden Thorp <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw5838">in an editorial</a> in the Feb. 14 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“In an age of growing, intense attacks on science, silence can be detrimental to both public trust and the careers of scientists who are under scrutiny,” writes Thorp and coauthor Meagan Phelan, communications director for <em>Science</em>. “For better or worse, journalists, social media professionals, and the public may take a response of ‘no comment’ as a concession that the critics are correct, so forthright communication about research questions is more urgent than ever.”</p>

<p>The editorial goes on to advise researchers to discuss any integrity inquiries with their institution, but to make their own decisions when it comes to discussing the issues openly with the media. In <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/some-guidance-authors-engaging-media">an accompanying blog post</a>, Thorp and Phelan give tips on steps to take when questions arise about the integrity of a published paper, including pointers on how to prepare for a conversation with reporters. (In the interest of transparency: Retraction Watch cofounder Ivan Oransky provided Phelan feedback on the tips at her request.)</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to be partnering with foremost scientific sleuth <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/about/">Elisabeth Bik</a> on a new way to support scientific integrity: The Elisabeth Bik Science Integrity Fund.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/eye-for-manipulation--a-profile-of-elisabeth-bik-65839">Bik</a> is a renowned science integrity advocate and microbiologist who investigates and exposes research misconduct, including image duplication and data manipulation, to uphold transparency and ethical standards in scientific publishing.</p>



<p>The Fund, launched with the proceeds of <a href="https://award.einsteinfoundation.de/award-winners-finalists/recipients-2024/elisabeth-bik">Bik’s Einstein Award</a>, will provide financial resources to Bik and other sleuths and collaborators, as well as provide funding for training programs, grants, or awards for science integrity advocates. Plans also include funding educational or outreach initiatives promoting transparency and accountability in scientific research. Based on a fiscal sponsorship model, and leveraging our experience in nonprofit development and administration, Bik will have full direction over the Fund’s resources.</p>



<span id="more-131033"></span>



<p><strong>“</strong>This Fund is a great chance to help science integrity advocates work better together to ensure research misconduct<strong> </strong>is exposed and addressed,” said Bik. “Keeping science honest takes a team effort, and with this support, I want to bring together even more sharp-eyed sleuths to keep research on the right track.<strong>”</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are delighted to partner with Bik, whose work has been so crucial to efforts to clean up the scientific record, to provide administrative support as well as a way donors can support her efforts and earn a tax deduction,” said Ivan Oransky, cofounder of Retraction Watch and executive director of The Center For Scientific Integrity, Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit organization. “We see the Fund fitting extremely well with our efforts at Retraction Watch and the Retraction Watch Database, as well as the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/02/introducing-the-retraction-watch-sleuth-in-residence-program/">Retraction Watch Sleuth In Residence</a> program. We are grateful that Bik has chosen us as a partner and can’t wait to see how much more impact the Fund will allow her to have.”</p>

<p>Two papers on a novel approach for flood prediction have been retracted for “substantial overlap” between the works. The authors, including <a href="https://www.dituniversity.edu.in/faculty/debopam-acharya/80">Debopam Acharya</a>, dean of the School of Computing at DIT University in Uttarakhand, India, are contesting both retractions.</p>



<p>The articles, published in 2023, are “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-023-15298-w">FLOODALERT: an internet of things based real-time flash flood tracking and prediction system</a>,” which appeared in&nbsp; <em>Multimedia Tools and Applications</em>, and “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12040-023-02172-4">An IoT-based system for monitoring and forecasting flash floods in real-time</a>,” from <em>Journal of Earth System Science.</em> They have been cited seven and five times, respectively.</p>



<p>The articles were retracted after a concerned researcher, who also reached out to Retraction Watch, emailed each journal about problems with the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131050"></span>



<p>Similarities between the publications include the authors’ proposal of a “novel technique” to “estimate river discharge based on sectional area and flow of the river,” the proposed architecture for data collection and prediction, and proposed mobile application for “real-time monitoring.” A comparison of the two documents shows much of the content, including the figures and most of the text in the introduction, results, discussion and conclusion, is shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Nature, the publisher of both journals, replied to our request for comment by reiterating the retraction notices, which were nearly identical for the two papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article because it contains substantial overlap in text and figures with two previous publications,” the December 2024 notice in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12040-024-02479-w"><em>JESS</em></a> reads. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-20460-z"><em>MTA</em> notice</a> references overlap with “another published article” but not the figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acharya told us in an email the authors are “challenging” the retractions.</p>



<p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9499-6851">Anurag Barthwal</a>, a researcher at Apeejay Stya University in Haryana, India, and the corresponding author on the articles, said the papers were retracted because “they have some overlapping text, images and a table, in the literature review and hardware architecture sections. It happened because of the mistake of research scholar [sic].”</p>



<p>The <em>MTA </em>manuscript was received Oct.13, 2022, three months after authors submitted the <em>JESS</em> manuscript, on July 18, 2022. Both papers were revised and accepted after a different article on the topic was published in <em>IEEE Sensors Journal (IEESJ)</em> by the same authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That paper, “<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9966518">FLOODWALL: A Real-Time Flash Flood Monitoring and Forecasting System Using IoT</a>,” was submitted Oct. 8, 2022, and published November 29. It has been cited 14 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Springer papers bear similarities with this one, including the authors’ “novel approach” for estimating river discharge. Although the <em>IEESJ</em> paper shares fewer similarities with the Springer papers than they do with each other, our analysis concluded it has the same proposed architecture. Tables 2, 3, and 4 as well as figures 2, 4, 5 ,6, and 8 of the paper are the same as at least one of the Springer papers.</p>



<p>“As the submissions deal with different problems related to flash floods, there was no intention to commit misconduct,” Barthwal said. “The [JESS] paper proposed only an architecture, no analysis or prediction. Other papers have different proposed models for analysis and solution approaches.”</p>



<p>In an email seen by Retraction Watch dated March 15, 2024, Marco Jose Da Silva, associate editor-in-chief of <em>IEESJ</em>, told the sleuth who emailed him the “parallel submission to different journals is obviously unethical. However, we at IEEE Sensors Journal were the first to publish the content and could not know about the parallel submissions. Therefore, the authors’ misconduct occurred with their submissions elsewhere, and IEEE is not in a position to address their misconduct.”</p>



<p>However, Carlos Ruiz Zamarreño, the journal’s associate editor-in-chief for publication integrity, had a different take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From “my point of view there is a clear misconduct of the authors with multiple submissions of the same work to different journals,” Zamarreño wrote in an email to editor-in-chief Zeynep Celik and seen by Retraction Watch. He noted that although the <em>IEESJ</em> article was published first, the manuscript was actually accepted after the authors submitted their manuscript to <em>JESS.</em> He stated IEEE publication principles dictate authors should disclose if the article was under consideration by any other journals. Zamarreño suggested the authors at least be notified of the policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celik, Zamarreño, and Silva forwarded our request for comment to Francine Tardo, an IEEE spokesperson. Tardo told us in an email the journal “previously reviewed this paper and we have nothing more to add at this time.”</p>



<p>Acharya said IEEE has “already written to us agreeing to our comments, that the work is original. We strongly believe that the others [sic] works will also be treated that way.” He also urged us not to write about the case: “If you or anybody write about this issue that is pending a decision between the author and the journal authorities, we will be forced to take appropriate actions against such writeups.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Science </em>is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/science/arseniclife-felisa-wolfe-simon-retraction.html">finally considering retracting a 2010 paper</a> claiming the discovery of a bacterium that could substitute arsenic for phosphorus in its chemical makeup. “We feel the best thing to do would be to retract the paper,” the journal’s editor-in-chief Holden Thorp told the <em>New York Times</em> in an article published Tuesday. </p>



<p>The article follows up with Felisa Wolfe-Simon, the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1197258">lead author of the work</a> who withdrew from science and public life after the intense spotlight from the work’s initial splash led to damaging criticism. She has recently gone back to the lab and in 2024 received a NASA exobiology grant.  </p>



<p>Retraction Watch readers may recall that <em>Science </em>published numerous technical comments and two studies refuting the original work. In 2012, David Sanders — who would later become <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">well-known as a sleuth</a> — said in our pages that the “only responsible action on the part of<em> Science</em> would be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/07/09/despite-refutation-science-arsenic-life-paper-deserves-retraction-scientist-argues/">to retract the original article</a>.”  He <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/01/21/why-one-biologist-says-its-not-too-late-to-retract-the-arsenic-life-paper/">called again for the retraction in 2021</a>.</p>



<span id="more-131043"></span>



<p>Also in 2012, we asked <em>Science </em>whether the journal had asked the authors if they wanted to retract the article. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/07/10/science-has-not-asked-for-a-correction-or-retraction-of-arsenic-life-paper-and-why-situation-is-unlike-xmrv-cfs/">They told us at the time</a>: “Except in rare cases, corrections, clarifications, or retractions should ideally be initiated by the original research authors.” </p>



<p>The <em>New York Times </em>article indicates the journal has had a change of heart. And yesterday Thorp linked to the article <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7295065626295828481/">on his LinkedIn page</a>, writing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Science initially published a large set of technical comments and the two failed replications but did not retract the paper. That was consistent with the norms at the time. As this paper continues to be discussed prominently, Science is of the view that the paper should be retracted. We have not done so yet, because we are working with the authors to ensure that they have every opportunity to understand our position and to make any additional arguments.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stay tuned.</p>

                <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Happy International Day of Women and Girls in Science! The 11th February 2025 marks the tenth anniversary of the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, but what is this day all about?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly declared the 11th February “International Day of Women and Girls in Science”; a day to raise awareness and promote equal access for women and girls in science and a day of celebration of the many successful women studying and working in science (1,2). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite progress in increasing the representation of women and girls in science, there remains a significant gender gap in the number of women in scientific disciplines around the world (1,3,4). Women only account for around one third of scientific researchers worldwide, with female representation decreasing in higher career stages, such as tenured positions (1,3,4,5). Additionally, women are credited less than men, their contributions are less likely to be recognised and they are often given smaller research grants than their male counterparts (3,6). This International Day of Women and Girls in Science, we would like to recognise some inspirational women in science, past and present, to raise awareness of the gender disparities that still exist in science today and to suggest some solutions for decreasing gender bias and inequity in science.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We are sure you will have heard of some of the trailblazing female scientists of our past: </span></span><u><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/marie-curie/biographical/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Marie Curie</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> and her pioneering work on radioactivity, </span></span><u><a href="https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/about/facts-figures/dr-rosalind-franklin/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Rosalind Franklin</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> and her contributions to the discovery of the DNA double helix, and </span></span><u><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/unveiling-the-legacy-of-rita-levi-montalcini-a-trailblazer-in-neuroscience" target="_blank"><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Rita Levi-Montalcini</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> and her discovery of nerve growth factor. However, as we are Women in Neuroscience UK, for this International Day of Women and Girls in Science we wanted to highlight some of the amazing women in neuroscience whose names often go largely unmentioned. We would like to acknowledge that there are so many incredible women in (neuro)science that we cannot possibly highlight them all, but we have chosen to focus on a few female neuroscientists who we find inspiring! </span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Maria was one of the first women to graduate from a medical degree in Russia. She conducted ground-breaking work in the field of sleep deprivation. Her work inspired much of the subsequent research into sleep, and her book, “Sleep as one Third of Human life: its physiology, pathology, hygiene, and psychology” has been translated into English, French, German and Italian. Maria challenged the idea that sleep was the absence of brain activity and instead proposed that the brain was in a different state of activity.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Prior to her work on sleep, Maria studied alcohol fermentation and confirmed the “chemical” hypothesis of fermentation. These findings were later replicated by Eduard Buchner who, despite being aware of Maria’s work, did not cite her findings or credit her. Buchner won the Nobel Prize for this discovery, while Maria received no recognition. Unfortunately, this was not an uncommon occurrence for women in science in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  </span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Laura was a pioneering doctor, surgeon, nurse and researcher who challenged societal norms and expectations by pursuing careers typically seen, at that time, to be “for men”. Her work spanned multiple fields and she published papers on muscle spindle fibres, ovarian diseases, tuberculosis and spinal nerve fibres. Laura worked as one of only two women in Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s laboratory. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In 1912 when the Balkan War began, Laura volunteered as a nurse; although she was certified, and had practiced, as a general practitioner, women were not allowed to serve as physicians. When the First World War was declared, Laura became the first female Australian doctor to serve in the wartime medical effort. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Cécile was the first woman to be nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and across her lifetime received an incredible 13 Nobel Prize nominations. Despite this, Cécile was never awarded the Nobel Prize, and to this day women are overlooked for academic prizes and recognition. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Cécile began medical school at age 18, despite only 6% of medical doctorates being awarded to women at that time. She continued to push boundaries and societal expectations, working in a laboratory in Berlin, despite most of the medical faculty being opposed to women studying. For much of her career, Cécile worked with no salary, simply because she was female. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Cécile, who worked with her husband Oskar Vogt, contributed heavily to the field of neuroanatomy. They identified that the motor and sensory cortices were functionally distinct areas of the cortex, provided insights into the organisation of the thalamus and the basal ganglia, and identified structural differences in the striatum in disorders like Huntington’s disease. In the 1920s, Cécile stated publicly that nothing in her research supported a difference between the brains of men and women. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite the immense difficulties of making it as a woman in science in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, what these women, and many others, achieved was remarkable. These incredible female neuroscientists paved the way for future women to succeed in science. We would like to highlight some inspiring women who work in neuroscience today, and who have had incredible achievements. Again, we cannot possibly highlight all the extraordinary women that work in (neuro)science but have chosen to feature a few women we find inspiring. </span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">May-Britt pioneered research into the neural basis of spatial orientation and memory. She won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2014, alongside Edvard Moser and John O’Keefe, for their discovery of place and grid cells. These cells allow us to orient ourselves in space, with place cells forming a map of our location and grid cells providing a coordinate system for positioning ourselves and pathfinding. May-Britt currently works as a Professor at the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. </span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Brenda is considered to be a founder of clinical neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience. She has made major contributions to our understanding of memory, language and linking brain structure to brain function. Brenda worked with the famous patient “</span></span><u><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2649674/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">HM</span></span></a></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">” and discovered that our brains do not have one singular memory system, but multiple systems. Notably, Brenda is still researching today, aged 106.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">We hope that sharing the successes of these trailblazing women in neuroscience inspires you to pursue whatever career path you wish to follow. We are grateful that the opportunities for women in science are improving and have progressed since the times of Maria, Laura and Cécile. However, we still have a long way to go. WiNUK aims to inspire, connect and advocate for gender equity in neuroscience and we stand against gender-based biases and discrimination, which unfortunately still remain in science. ​</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>What gender inequity and gender biases are there in science?</strong></span></span></u></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women are underrepresented in tenured positions, in the top research institutes and in scientific agencies, such as the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the European Research Council (1,3). This has a plethora of effects: less women in higher positions means there are less female role models, less female mentorship and less females in recruitment and hiring, all of which perpetuates the cycle. Additionally, women are underrepresented as first and last authors in publishing, relative to the proportion of female scientists and there are gender differences in citation numbers (3). In scientific funding, women typically gain fewer grants and smaller amounts of funding than men, particularly at later career stages (3). Another major gender inequity is family planning and childcare; pregnancy, childbirth, nursing and childcare take time, as well as mental and physical resources, and women are disproportionately affected (3).  </span></span></p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/neurosurgical_review.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="158" height="209" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/neurosurgical_review.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131027"/></a></figure></div>


<p><em>Neurosurgical Review</em> has begun retracting scores of commentaries and&nbsp; letters to the editor after getting inundated by AI-generated manuscripts. At the top of the affiliations list: Saveetha University in Chennai, India, an institution that, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">as we reported with <em>Science</em></a> in 2023, engages in aggressive self-citation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At publication time, <em>Neurosurgical Review</em> had retracted 129 papers so far this year. The journal, a Springer Nature publication, paused acceptance of letters to the editor and commentaries last fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December we reported in another <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/shoddy-commentaries-quick-and-dirty-route-higher-impact-numbers-are-rise">collaboration with <em>Science</em></a> that <em>Neurosurgical Review </em>paused accepting commentaries and letters to the editor last year after getting overwhelmed by submissions that appeared to be generated using large language models (LLMs).&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131025"></span>



<p>“A number of articles have been retracted, but our investigation is still ongoing, and further editorial action will be taken as appropriate,” Sverre Klemp, an executive publisher at Springer Nature, told us.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/search?query=%22Hethesh+Chellapandian%22+%22Sivakamavalli+Jeyachandran+%22">notices</a> for the new retractions state:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. An investigation by the Publisher found that a number of articles, including this one, that comment on research published in the Journal were submitted over a short space of time and show strong indications that the text was generated by a large language model (LLM) without proper disclosure by the authors. These articles are therefore in breach of the Journal&#8217;s editorial policy and are being retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Klemp told us the journal is continuing to investigate, but declined to share additional information.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Of the retracted commentaries, 87 were written by researchers from Saveetha and 35 of them were written by two researchers at Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Hethesh Chellapandian and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2368-0518">Sivakamavalli Jeyachandran</a>, according to the <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/saveetha_Jeyachandran_email.pdf">email</a>, Jeyachandran told us he disagreed with the retractions. He called the decision to retract his articles because he didn’t disclose the use of LLMs “highly troubling. … Retractions are meant for serious misconduct — fabricated data, plagiarism, or harmful misinformation — not procedural oversights that do not impact the scientific record.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jeyachandran said the retracted articles were commentaries, not studies, with “no instances of data fabrication, plagiarism, or breaches of journal policy. If journals begin retracting publications simply over undisclosed AI assistance, the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable practices become increasingly unclear.”</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10143/submission-guidelines">author submission guidelines</a> for <em>Neurosurgical Review</em>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Use of an LLM should be properly documented in the Methods section (and if a Methods section is not available, in a suitable alternative part) of the manuscript. The use of an LLM (or other AI-tool) for &#8220;AI assisted copy editing&#8221; purposes does not need to be declared. … In all cases, there must be human accountability for the final version of the text and agreement from the authors that the edits reflect their original work.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Saveetha and its dental school have been the subject of allegations of citation stacking, as well, as we reported in&nbsp; a 2023 <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">collaboration with <em>Science</em></a>. Citation stacking happens when researchers include unnecessary citations to bolster metrics, including self-citation. Following our investigation, retractions increased for authors affiliated with the institution.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/21524382"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21524382/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>



<p>In 2024, journals retracted at least 80 papers from Saveetha authors. The retractions from <em>Neurosurgical Review</em> attributed to researchers at the university bring the 2025 total to 90, less than six weeks into the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January, Saveetha was among the schools identified as engaging in “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/10/bibliometrics-universities-publication-metrics-authorship/">questionable authorship practices</a>” in a study published in January in <em>Quantitative Science Studies</em>, including a 100% growth in research output from 2019 to 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A retraction for Saveetha researchers in another journal, <em>Heliyon CellPress</em>, highlighted one such practice — citation stacking. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844025003810">retraction notice</a>, issued January 30, for the 2024 paper “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844025003810">MPPT efficiency enhancement of a grid connected solar PV system using Finite Control set model predictive controller</a>” stated the article was retracted at the request of the editor-in-chief:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An investigation conducted on behalf of the journal by Elsevier&#8217;s Research Integrity &amp; Publishing Ethics team found a significant increase of citations to papers published by the author, Ayodeji Olalekan Salau, between the original submission and the revised version of this article. In summary, zero papers by the author were cited in the original version of the article. This increased to ten papers in the revised version of the article. The investigation also found phrases that make some passages in the article difficult to parse. The authors were requested to explain the use of these passages of text but were unable to do so. The Editor has lost confidence in the findings of the article and has determined that it should be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An Elsevier spokesperson told us the retraction followed an “audit of articles published in Heliyon” and that the investigation into the journal was “still ongoing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the notice stated both authors disagreed with the retraction, Girma Alitasb, the co-author, told us in an email he “respect[s] the journal’s decision.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alitasb, a researcher for Debre Markos University in Ethiopia, said he was “not involved in any intentional citation manipulation. During the revision stage, my focus was solely on addressing the reviewers&#8217; comments, and I was unaware that additional citations were added. These changes were made by the corresponding author without my approval.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salau did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/10/vegetative-electron-microscopy-fingerprint-paper-mill/">As a nonsense phrase of shady provenance makes the rounds, Elsevier defends its use</a></h4>

              
                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vem-main-rev.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="720" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vem-main-rev.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131015" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vem-main-rev.png 1000w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vem-main-rev-300x216.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vem-main-rev-768x553.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The origin of the phrase?</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The phrase was so strange it would have stood out even to a non-scientist. Yet “vegetative electron microscopy” had already made it past reviewers and editors at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cvegetative+electron%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5">several journals</a> when a Russian chemist and scientific sleuth noticed the odd wording in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-022-23253-9">a now-retracted paper</a> in Springer Nature’s <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ludicrous phrase is what sleuths call a “fingerprint”: an offbeat characteristic found in one or more publications that suggests paper-mill involvement. Today, a Google Scholar search turns up <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cvegetative+electron+microscope%E2%80%9D+OR+%E2%80%9Cvegetative+electron+microscopy%E2%80%9D&amp;btnG=">nearly two dozen articles</a> that refer to “vegetative electron microscopy” or “vegetative electron microscope,”  including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669023016692?via%3Dihub">a paper</a> from 2024 whose senior author is an editor at Elsevier, Retraction Watch has learned. The publisher told us it was “content” with the wording.</p>



<p>Searching for such clues is just one way to identify the hundreds of thousands of <a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224">fake papers analysts say are polluting the scientific literature</a>, as we reported in an investigation published last month in <em>The Conversation</em>. And the tale of “vegetative electron microscopy” shows how nonsense phrases can enter the vocabulary of researchers and proliferate in the literature.</p>



<span id="more-131004"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After spotting the term, the Russian chemist, who goes by the pseudonym “Paralabrax clathratus” on PubPeer, left <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8AF14503BCD28365A0C945BA3AF188#2">a comment</a> about it in November 2022 on the online forum. He also mentioned the finding to fellow fraud buster Alexander Magazinov, a software engineer in Kazakhstan, who ran a Google Scholar search on the term and got several hits, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22vegetative+electron%22+and+%22magazinov%22">some of which</a> he flagged on PubPeer. Most of the articles included authors from Iran.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7C9F0CCD493B1129135A3A918B0AAB#4">one of his PubPeer comments</a>, Magazinov speculated the phrase could have originated through faulty digital processing of <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/br.23.1.1-7.1959">a two-column article</a> from 1959 in which the word “vegetative” appeared in the left column directly opposite “electron microscopy” in the right (the paper shows up in a Google search for “vegetative electron microscopy”). Perhaps an AI model had picked it up and spit it back into machine-generated text that was since plagiarized in other papers by the same Iranian network of fraudsters, Magazinov elaborated in an interview.</p>

<p>The term, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-04-02/one-of-the-worlds-most-cited-scientists-rafael-luque-suspended-without-pay-for-13-years.html">mentioned</a> in passing in a story from 2023 in the Spanish newspaper <em>El País</em>, was later incorporated into the Problematic Paper Screener. This automated tool <a href="https://theconversation.com/problematic-paper-screener-trawling-for-fraud-in-the-scientific-literature-246317">combs through 130 million articles</a> every week with nine detectors searching for new instances of known fingerprints, the improper use of synonyms to evade plagiarism detectors, and the misuse of generative AI. Guillaume Cabanac, a computer scientist who developed the program and a coauthor of our investigation in <em>The Conversation</em>, has posted <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7E79C63A6C566C67D6B46715F8B906#2">a list of 78 papers</a> the tool has flagged in Springer Nature’s <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em> alone.</p>



<p>Cabanac’s list includes the article the Russian chemist had first stumbled on, which was published in 2022. According to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8AF14503BCD28365A0C945BA3AF188#1">a PubPeer post</a> by sleuth Nicholas Wise of the University of Cambridge in England, the paper, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-022-23253-9">Photodegradation of ibuprofen laden-wastewater using sea-mud catalyst/H2O2 system: evaluation of sonication modes and energy consumption</a>,” matched an authorship ad in Farsi posted to the messaging platform Telegram in 2022. Its authors counted several researchers in Iran as well as Rafael Luque, a controversial and hyperprolific Spanish scientist who was <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-04-02/one-of-the-worlds-most-cited-scientists-rafael-luque-suspended-without-pay-for-13-years.html">suspended from his institution</a> that same year.</p>



<p>Springer Nature <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-33075-6">retracted</a> the paper in 2024 after an investigation “found a number of articles, including this one, with a number of concerns, including but not limited to compromised peer review process, inappropriate or irrelevant references, containing nonstandard phrases or not being in scope of the journal.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">No other work containing the term has been retracted so far. But an <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/5/1799">article</a> coauthored by Luque <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/12/2841">has been corrected</a> to remove “irrelevant citations,” and to change “vegetative electron microscopy” to “scanning electron microscopy” and “extracellular cells” to “extracellular membrane,” according to the Swiss-based publisher MDPI.</p>



<p>Luque did not answer emails seeking comment. Neither did the corresponding author of the retracted article, Mohsen Omidvar of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, in Iran.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Elsevier is defending the use of the odd wording, which appeared in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669023016692?via%3Dihub">a paper</a> from February 2024 in the journal <em>Industrial Crops and Products</em>. The work, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669023016692?via%3Dihub">Agricultural wastes: A practical and potential source for the isolation and preparation of cellulose and application in agriculture and different industries,</a>” purportedly used “vegetative electron microscopy” to study the structure of bacterial cellulose derived from date syrup.</p>



<p>A spokesperson told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>During our investigation, the Editor-in-Chief confirmed that ‘vegetative electron microscopy’ is a way of conveying ‘electron microscopy of vegetative structures’ so he was content with the shortened version to be used.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As pointed out by Magazinov <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0F56B4CFC4FCC378C905F7D28CE46F/#1">on PubPeer</a>, the senior author of the paper is Vijay Kumar Thakur, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240531093054/https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/industrial-crops-and-products/about/editorial-board">a special content editor</a> at <em>Industrial Crops and Products</em> with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22+Vijay+Kumar+Thakur%22">a long record on PubPeer</a>. Thakur, who is head of the Biorefining and Advanced Materials Research Centre at Scotland&#8217;s Rural College, in Edinburgh, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Magazinov also said in his PubPeer comment that the paper contained “<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0F56B4CFC4FCC378C905F7D28CE46F/#2">massive self-citation</a>” by two of the authors, both based in Iran, an allegation the publisher said it was still investigating.</p>



<p>As for Elsevier’s explanation of “vegetative electron microscopy,” Magazinov told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>So, we are learning that bacterial cellulose is a kind of &#8220;vegetative structure&#8221;. They are taking a piss without even pulling their pants down, aren&#8217;t they?</p>
</blockquote>
