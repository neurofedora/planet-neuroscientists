<p><strong>X-rays of the brain in thin cross sections </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/x-rays-brain-thin-cross-sections"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 1, 1973</p>



<p>A new [device], already hailed by some physicians as the most important advance in X-ray diagnosis since its original development, promises to give a detailed new look at the inner brain.… The EMI device produces detailed information about a particular region of the brain with relatively little radiation exposure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h3>



<p>That device was the first X-ray computed tomography, or CT, scanner. Today, the technology lets doctors and researchers peer inside not only the human brain, but also other organs, bones and even blood vessels. CT scanning has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scan-50-years-anniversary-first-image-medicine-physics">also become a useful tool in other areas of science</a>, from archaeology to zoology (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 44</em>). For instance, the technology helped reveal why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">pumpkin toadlets are clumsy hoppers</a>: Their inner ears may be too small to maintain good balance (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 5</em>). Sharper images made by a “<a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/newsroom/two-monumental-milestones-achieved-ct-imaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photon-counting</a>” CT scanner — approved last year by the U.S. Food and Drug A­dministration — could help resolve other mysteries too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newborn-baby-music-pain-heel-pricks-mozart">A classical lullaby helped reduce newborns’ pain during heel pricks</a></h4>

              
                <p>The soothing tones of a classical lullaby may help to relieve the pain newborns can feel from routine medical procedures. The mellifluous method could be a beneficial addition to other pain-easing tactics.</p>



<p>In a randomized clinical trial at a hospital nursery, newborns received a sugar solution — a standard method to lessen pain — before a heel prick. Around half of the infants also had a classical lullaby playing from speakers near their beds before, during and after the procedure. The lullaby group <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-023-02746-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scored lower on a newborn pain scale</a> at the time of the prick and after, compared with the group that only got sugar, researchers report August 29 in <em>Pediatric Research.</em></p>





<p>“Since they gave sucrose, it’s hard to say yes, music by itself would help,” says Mallory Perry-Eaddy, a pediatric intensive care unit nurse and a nurse scientist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. But combining music with other pain-relieving methods “could be really useful.”</p>



<p>Until fairly recently, the medical community did not believe newborns experienced pain. But over the last several decades, studies have revealed that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4402596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infants do perceive pain, and they may be more sensitive to painful stimuli than adults are</a>. Enduring repeated pain-inducing procedures without pain-relief treatment can have lasting neurological consequences for infants, including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncpneuro0984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a heightened perception of pain</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s very important that we do try to stay on top of [pain] prior to procedures,” says Perry-Eaddy, rather than just trying to alleviate pain afterwards.</p>



<p>Heel pricks and shots are among the routine procedures newborns have soon after birth that can cause pain. The heel prick produces a few drops of blood for tests, including to check for certain disorders. Generally, for minor procedures like a heel prick, doctors and nurses turn to pain-reducing methods that don’t involve medication, says Saminathan Anbalagan, a neonatologist at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx, N.Y. Among these methods are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6570422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skin-to-skin contact between a parent and an infant, breastfeeding</a> and giving a newborn a sugar solution.</p>



<p>At Anbalagan’s hospital, the sugar solution combined with any of the other non-pharmacological approaches is the standard protocol, he says. He and his colleagues wanted to study music as another potential option that could be easily implemented and is cost-effective.</p>



<p>The research team randomly sorted 100 infants born at Lincoln into a lullaby and a no-music group. For the lullaby group, <a></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2cksmXWj_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the song “Deep Sleep”</a> from <em>Bedtime Mozart: Classical Lullabies for Babies</em> began playing 20 minutes before the heel prick and continued for another five minutes after. The researchers assessed pain with a neonatal infant pain scale that considers newborns’ facial expressions, whether they cry, their breathing patterns and other signs. The pain scale ranges from 0 to 7.</p>



<p>During the heel prick, the no-music group had an average pain score of just under 7. But serenading the infants with a classical lullaby reduced the score to below 5. After that peak, the overall score steadily dropped for both groups in the next five minutes, with the lullaby group continuing to score lower.</p>



<p>More research is needed to better understand neonatal pain and determine the most effective ways to relieve it, including the optimal combination of methods, Anbalagan says. But “<a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/137/2/e20154271/52762/Prevention-and-Management-of-Procedural-Pain-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven and safe therapies are currently underused</a> for routine minor, yet pain procedures,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Along with investigating the effectiveness of music as a pain-relief method, Anbalagan and his colleagues sought to bring awareness to newborn pain with their study.</p>



<p>“While the misconception [about newborns and pain] has faded, it continues to be a common way of thinking in some health care settings,” he says. “Why some hospitals don’t have protocols for pain relief from minor procedures in neonates remains puzzling.”</p>

<p>A preprint about millipedes that was written using OpenAI&#8217;s chatbot <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> is <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3257909/v1">back online</a> after being withdrawn for including made-up references, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, fake references and all, is also under review by a journal specializing in tropical insects.</p>



<p>“This undermines trust in the scientific literature,&#8221; said <a href="https://snm.ku.dk/english/staffsnm/staff/?pure=en/persons/52118">Henrik Enghoff</a>, a millipede researcher at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, in Copenhagen, who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/07/publisher-blacklists-authors-after-preprint-cites-made-up-studies/">first spotted problems</a> with the preprint, as we reported last month.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127813"></span>



<p>He and others said the case had caused a stir among researchers studying millipedes and centipedes, collectively known as myriapods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The myriapodological community is alert and closely following this matter,&#8221; said Carlos Martínez, a centipede taxonomist and a research associate at <a href="https://www.senckenberg.de/en/">Senckenberg Society for Nature Research</a>, in Frankfurt, Germany. &#8220;I have also taken a personal interest in stopping this spurious manuscript from polluting the scientific record.&#8221;</p>



<p>The paper <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202306.1339/v1">first appeared</a> on Preprints.org in June. It came to Enghoff’s attention after he received an email from ResearchGate notifying him that his work had been cited. The citations were botched, he found, and some papers he was supposed to have written didn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>&#8220;This was so obvious that it had to be caught,&#8221; Enghoff told Retraction Watch. &#8220;But there could be subtler cases where something is published that is completely fictitious but won&#8217;t be detected.&#8221;</p>



<p>After learning of the fake references, staff at the preprint server, suspecting the involvement of a chatbot, pulled down the article and blacklisted its authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The manuscript had also been submitted to MDPI&#8217;s journal <em>Insects,</em> but had been rejected, Enghoff said a colleague told him.</p>



<p>According to a Danish newspaper following up on Retraction Watch&#8217;s reporting, the preprint&#8217;s corresponding author, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7310-8085">Kahsay Tadesse Mawcha of Aksum University in Ethiopia</a>, <a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/2023-30/ideer/tusindben-paa-afveje">admitted to using ChatGPT</a> to produce the manuscript.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mawcha reportedly explained that he wasn&#8217;t “good at using AI” and had since realized that ChatGPT was &#8220;not recommended&#8221; for writing scientific articles.</p>



<p>Then on August 25, Mawcha <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3257909/v1">posted</a> an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Mawcha-2023-preprint-v.2.pdf">updated version</a> of the paper to the preprint server Research Square. Two days later, an email appeared in Enghoff&#8217;s inbox alerting him that his work had been cited. It was déjà vu: Mawcha, who now appeared as the sole author of the manuscript, had deleted the made-up papers by Enghoff in the reference list, but the Danish researcher&#8217;s work again was being cited for something off-topic, Enghoff said.</p>



<p>What’s more, the revised preprint&#8217;s reference list still mostly consisted of fictitious papers, according to Leif Moritz, who has studied myriapods at the Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity Change, in Bonn, Germany.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I personally find most worrying is that many of these made-up references suggest that millipedes have a more negative effect as pests on crops than is actually true,&#8221; Moritz told Retraction Watch. &#8220;This in turn might not only lead to a negative perception of these animals in the public but also to misguided decisions by policy makers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mawcha did not respond to a request for comments.</p>



<p>Asked if Research Square was aware of the manuscript’s troubled history, Mark Brewin, an editorial specialist at the company, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our retraction alert feature is currently in for repairs, so meanwhile we&#8217;re endeavoring to catch these manually. Under the circumstances, our editorial team will look into this case and take appropriate action on the preprint.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On August 30,&nbsp; the preprint <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3257909/v1">website</a> said Mawcha&#8217;s paper, titled &#8220;From Beneficial Arthropods to Soil-Dwelling Organisms: A Review on Millipedes in Africa,&#8221; was being reviewed by the <em>International Journal of Tropical Insect Science</em>. But the following day, after we contacted Research Square, all mention of the journal had disappeared from the website.</p>



<p>Ritter Atoundem Guimapi, an editor at the journal, told Retraction Watch he and his colleagues were aware of the issues related to the manuscript and were &#8220;handling the case accordingly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Martínez, the centipede expert at <a href="https://www.senckenberg.de/en/">Senckenberg Society for Nature Research</a>, said he had emailed Mawcha and asked him to stop trying to publish &#8220;his AI-generated manuscript.&#8221; He also contacted the <em>International Journal of Tropical Insect Science</em>, he said, as well as the African Association of Insect Scientists and Ethiopia’s embassy in Germany.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-melting-dipole-arctic-oscillation">Arctic sea ice may melt faster in coming years due to shifting winds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A flip-flopping, yearslong pattern of winds helps control the fate of the Arctic’s sea ice — by regulating how much of the Atlantic Ocean’s relatively warm, salty water sneaks northward into the Arctic Ocean.</p>



<p>From 2007 to 2021, winds over North America and Eurasia were circulating in such a way that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh5158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they reduced the influx of warmer Atlantic water into the Arctic</a>, researchers report in the Sept. 1 <em>Science</em>. That helped slow the rate of sea ice loss during that time period — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">even as atmospheric warming ramped up</a> (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>). But that grace period may come to an end within just a few years. When the winds shift back, enhanced “Atlantification” of the Arctic may speed up sea ice loss, by giving an extra oomph of warming from below.</p>





<p>“This phase has lasted about 15 years. We’re about at the end,” says physical oceanographer Igor Polyakov of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “The sea ice will be responding. There’s a great possibility for this rapid change in the system.”</p>



<p>Earth’s busy, interactive layers of ocean and atmosphere feature many different regional and global patterns that toggle between two different phases over years to decades, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">El Niño</a> and La Niña phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (<em>SN: 6/15/23</em>).</p>



<p>The Arctic Dipole is a smaller-scale, regional pattern of winds that is having a global impact, Polyakov and colleagues suggest. To assess its influence, the researchers compared atmospheric wind patterns since 1979 with trends in summer ice extent and thickness gathered from satellite, airplane and shipboard surveys over that time frame. A clear relationship emerged, they say.</p>

<p>From 1979 to 2006, the Arctic Dipole was in a “negative” phase, with winds rotating counterclockwise over North America and clockwise over Eurasia. That brought more Atlantic water into the Arctic via the Fram Strait, a narrow strip of ocean between Greenland and Norway’s Svalbard archipelago. During that time period, summertime sea ice extent shrank rapidly from year to year, vanishing at a rate of about 1 million square kilometers per decade.</p>



<p>The year 2007, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-warming-noaa-report-card-2020">a record-breaking year for Arctic sea ice loss</a>, marked the end of this “negative” phase of the Arctic Dipole (<em>SN: 12/9/20</em>). From then until 2021, the rate of sea ice loss across the entire Arctic slowed, shrinking by only about 70,000 square kilometers per decade — largely due to atmospheric warming,</p>



<p>That’s not to say that the ice has recovered. It remains at a very low extent compared to the historical record. Human-caused global warming has ramped up heating across the region and created feedback loops that enhance sea ice loss: Melting sea ice exposes more ocean surface to the sun, warming that surface water, in turn enhancing ice melt. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the current, “positive” phase of the Dipole has helped put the brakes on the dramatic rate of Arctic sea ice loss — for now, Polyakov says. Less Atlantic water flowing in through the Fram Strait means the waters of the Arctic Ocean remain stratified — tightly layered, with the less-dense, colder, fresher Arctic water sitting on top of the warmer Atlantic waters like a lid on a pot.</p>



<p>That’s been protecting the sea ice from melting from below, says Thomas Rippeth, a physical oceanographer at Bangor University in Wales who was not involved in the new study. Whether another switchover in the Arctic Dipole is about to occur, shifting winds and encouraging more warm waters to flow northward, isn’t yet clear, Rippeth says. “This paper is telling us what to look for — that’s why it’s an important piece of work.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-cold-human-ancestors-population-crash-dna">Extreme cold may have nearly wiped out human ancestors 900,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human ancestors nearly died out between around 930,000 to 813,000 years ago in an evolutionarily pivotal population bust, a contested new study concludes.</p>



<p>This potential winnowing of human ancestors into a barely sustainable number of survivors coincided with a period of extreme cold and extended droughts in Africa and Eurasia, previous geologic evidence indicates.</p>



<p>If the new DNA-derived scenario holds up, relatively few survivors of the Stone Age big chill may have evolved into a species ancestral to <em>Homo sapiens</em>, Neandertals and Denisovans, say population geneticist Wangjie Hu of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and colleagues. Previous analyses of DNA extracted from ancient fossils estimate that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03244-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this common ancestral species</a> appeared between around 700,000 and 500,000 years ago.</p>





<p>Not too long before that, members of the human genus,<em> Homo</em>, weathered a roughly 117,000-year-long freeze while maintaining an average of 1,280 individuals capable of breeding, the researchers report in the Sept. 1 <em>Science</em>. That number of our evolutionary precursors <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj9484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproduced just enough to stave off extinction</a>, they say.</p>



<p>Before the onset of the harsh climate, the number of potential breeders in the same ancestral population had totaled between 58,600 and 135,000 individuals, the team estimates.</p>



<p>Hu’s team devised a new statistical method to estimate the timing and sizes of ancient breeding populations using patterns of shared gene variants in human populations today. The modern genetic data came from 3,154 people in 10 African populations and 40 European and Asian populations. Hu’s group obtained that information from two scientific databases of human DNA.</p>



<p>The scientists calculated the expected diversity of these modern variants based on hypothetical ancient population histories, some of which included periods of drastic declines in numbers of breeding adults. A population crash among human ancestors that lasted from about 930,000 to 813,000 years ago best accounted for the genetic variation in the analyzed data, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>Africans displayed much stronger genetic evidence of an ancient population crash than non-Africans did, the scientists found. A depleted population of human ancestors probably lived in Africa starting around 900,000 years ago, although Eurasia cannot be excluded as a home region for those survivors, the team says.</p>



<p>As that diminished population began to rebound, its members <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-human-evolution-habitat-migration">may have evolved into <em>H. heidelbergensis</em></a>, Hu’s group suspects (<em>SN: 4/13/22</em>). Some researchers regard <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> as an ancestor of Denisovans, Neandertals and <em>H. sapiens </em>that first appeared around 700,000 years ago in Africa and Eurasia. But other scientists say that fossils assigned to <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> contain too many skeletal differences to qualify as a single <em>Homo</em> species.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj9484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comment published with the new study</a>, archaeologist Nick Ashton &nbsp;and paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer provisionally accept the new estimate of an ancient population crash among human ancestors.</p>



<p>Even so, an increasing number of fossil discoveries suggest that groups in the <em>Homo</em> genus occupied various parts of Africa, Asia and Europe between roughly 900,000 and 800,000 years ago, during the newly proposed population crunch, say Ashton and Stringer, both of the Natural History Museum in London. Populations unrelated to later <em>H. sapiens</em> that lived on those continents may somehow have survived severe global cooling better than groups related to people today, they suggest.</p>



<p>DNA from ancient <em>H. sapiens</em>, Neandertals and Denisovans will help to clarify when and where ancient population crashes occurred, Ashton and Stringer say.</p>



<p>Hu and colleagues’ report raises the possibility that ancestral human populations temporarily suffered a steep drop in numbers and formed small groups that rarely mated with each other, says population geneticist Aaron Ragsdale of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>





<p>But confirmation of the new findings must come from genetic studies that account for ancient fluctuations in population density, geographic range and interbreeding as well as population size, Ragsdale says.</p>



<p>Because estimated sizes of ancient breeding populations often downplay actual population numbers, “it’s a stretch to say that ancestral human populations were close to extinction,” he says.</p>



<p>Population geneticist Stephan Schiffels of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany sees no reason to accept the new study’s conclusions. Interconnected ancestries among ancient <em>Homo</em> groups and statistical uncertainties in determining their genetic ties obscure any molecular signals of population collapses that occurred nearly 1 million years ago, Schiffels contends.</p>



<p>“The suggested precision in dating events like this [proposed ancient population crash] is not possible,” he says.</p>



<p>Present-day human DNA analyzed in the new study has been studied and modeled for years by other investigators, none of whom have cited any signs of such an ancient, steep population decline, Schiffels says.</p>



<p>But severe climate shifts could potentially have pushed human ancestors and other species close to or over the brink of extinction, says population geneticist and study coauthor Ziqian Hao of Shandong First Medical University in Jinan, China. In the Aug. 10 <em>Science</em>, another team — including Ashton and Stringer — described ancient climate reconstructions indicating that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf4445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a previously unrecognized cold phase in Europe led to sharp declines in hominid numbers about 1.1 million years ago</a>.</p>



<p>Hu and colleagues plan to incorporate ancient hominid DNA and a larger sample of present-day human DNA, especially from Africa, into further analyses of ancient population ups and downs.</p>

<p>Marc Tessier-Lavigne, whose <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/19/stanford-president-resigns-over-manipulated-research-will-retract-at-least-3-papers/">resignation</a> as president of Stanford University becomes effective today, is retracting two papers from <em>Science</em> following an institutional investigation that found data manipulation in multiple figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both articles, “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1058445">Hierarchical Organization of Guidance Receptors: Silencing of Netrin Attraction by Slit Through a Robo/DCC Receptor Complex</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1059391">Binding of DCC by Netrin-1 to Mediate Axon Guidance Independent of Adenosine A2B Receptor Activation</a>,” were published in 2001, when Tessier-Lavigne, the corresponding author, was at the University of California, San Francisco. They have been cited well over 600 times in total, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. </p>



<p>Anonymous users on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BFCF07AC5A957DB7E8950B448CB6CB#1">posted</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/59C3359E71EED451E01AF46CFDC0BC#1">concerns</a> about potentially manipulated images in the papers as early as 2015. Reporting by <em>The Stanford Daily</em> in <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/29/stanford-presidents-research-under-investigation-for-scientific-misconduct-university-admits-mistakes/">November 2022</a> spurred the university to <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/stanford-is-investigating-its-own-president-over-research-misconduct-allegations">launch an investigation</a> into several of Tessier-Lavigne’s papers, how he responded when others identified issues in his articles, and the culture of his lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university <a href="https://boardoftrustees.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/07/Scientific-Panel-Final-Report.pdf">published the final report</a> last month, finding that four of the five papers it reviewed on which Tessier-Lavigne was a principal author contained “apparent manipulation of research data by others.” Tessier-Lavigne, the investigation committee concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127800"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>did not have actual knowledge of the manipulation of research data that occurred in his lab and was not reckless in failing to identify such manipulation prior to publication.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The two <em>Science</em> papers were among those in which the panel identified manipulated data. In a <a href="https://tessier-lavigne-lab.stanford.edu/news/message-stanford-community">statement</a> posted to his lab website on July 19, the same day as the report was published, Tessier-Lavigne wrote that he planned to retract the articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne did not respond to our request for comment, nor did Elke Stein, the first author on both papers. The notices state Stein, who is the only other author besides Tessier-Lavigne on one of the papers, did not agree with either retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Tessier-Lavigne was aware of the issues raised on PubPeer, according to the investigation report. In 2015 he submitted corrections for the two papers to <em>Science</em> that attributed the issues to a software phenomenon called “tiling” rather than data manipulation. In fact, the panel members wrote in the report:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Tiling does not explain the underlying image manipulations in at least some of the figures to which the explanation was intended to apply.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Due to an error,” the journal did not publish the corrections, Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the <em>Science</em> family of journals, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/stanford-investigates-potential-misconduct-president-s-research">acknowledged</a> to the journal’s editorially independent news division.</p>



<p>After June 2016, Tessier-Lavigne did not follow up about the corrections that were never published, Stanford’s report stated. Instead, it described times he “failed to decisively and forthrightly correct mistakes in the scientific record.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2021, scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/59C3359E71EED451E01AF46CFDC0BC#14">posted a comment</a> on PubPeer pointing out the journal’s apparent lack of action on concerns raised about one of the papers and added a few findings of her own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her comment prompted Tessier-Lavigne to draft an email to <em>Science</em> asking about the status of the two corrections, according to the report, but he never sent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne told the investigation panel he “has a practice of drafting many e-mails to see how they read but only sends a portion of them and that he concluded the communication was unnecessary,” according to the report. The panel wrote that his decision not to follow up on the corrections “was insufficiently attentive to the continuing need to correct the scientific record.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2022, after the <em>Stanford Daily</em> story drew attention to the issues with the papers, <em>Science</em> published <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.adg2852">editorial expressions of concern</a> for both articles, signed by Thorp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notices acknowledged and described the 2015 corrections that were never published, and alluded to “additional concerns.” Thorp wrote that the journal was not proceeding with the corrections, but “alerting readers to the concerns while the authors and the authors’ institution investigate further.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The retractions, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk1517">posted</a> <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk1521">today</a>, recap the papers’ history of publication, corrections that never appeared, and expressions of concern. Both notices state that an institutional investigation “is complete and has identified further issues, including manipulation of data-containing portions” in multiple figures, “undermining confidence in the paper’s conclusions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tessier-Lavigne signed both notices, and wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I regret the impact of these issues on the scientific community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Author retractions, such as Tessier-Lavigne’s, make up the bulk of the retractions <em>Science</em> has published in the last six years, a journal spokesperson told us – 14 of 16 issued since 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After receiving an author’s request for retraction, the spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The role of the journal is to evaluate the request and make a decision based on various considerations, including the validity and seriousness of the concerns raised. At <em>Science</em>, we follow guidelines for retractions set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) to help ensure that the retraction process is fair, transparent, and consistent across different publications. For any retraction request by an author, we need to confirm that the retraction request aligns with COPE guidelines. In the event of an author retraction request, <em>Science</em> also reaches out to all authors of the paper to determine whether they agree to authorship of the retraction. In cases where there has been an institutional investigation, <em>Science</em> is guided by committee recommendations as well. Upon its decision, the journal must prepare to communicate openly with its readership about the retraction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bik, who raised new concerns about one of the <em>Science</em> papers on PubPeer in 2021 and evaluated the potential issues in Tessier-Lavigne’s publications for Theo Baker, the Stanford student journalist who broke the story, told us she had not expected the two papers would be retracted:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I expected that the issues that had been raised on PubPeer would perhaps not be rising to the level where <em>Science</em> would think it necessary to retract after so many years, but they did.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“In the past, both parties dropped the ball,” she said of Tessier-Lavigne and <em>Science</em> failing to publish the agreed-upon corrections. “I think now they’re making up for it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expressions of concern like the ones <em>Science</em> published after Baker’s story are a “very good and underused method to flag a paper when under investigation,” Bik said.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>From that point on I think the whole retraction process has been handled well by the journal. At least compared to other journals.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bik credited “the bravery of the student-run newspaper” for shining a light on the concerns an anonymous person raised back in 2015:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It’s only because of coverage by the news that these things have finally been addressed. They should have been addressed a long time ago.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-egypt-jars-complex-mummification-balms">Ancient Egyptian jars hint at complex mummification balms</a></h4>

              
                <p>­­Jars holding the innards of an ancient Egyptian noblewoman from roughly 3,500 years ago contain hints of one of the most complex mummification balms of that era, a new study shows.</p>



<p>About 120 years ago, the remains of a woman named Senetnay were found entombed among pharaohs and esteemed nobles in Egypt’s Valley of Kings. Such an honored burial was rare. Inscriptions on vessels in the tomb indicate she not only was a wet nurse to the pharaoh Amenhotep II, but also remarkably close to him.</p>





<p>An analysis of the jars that held her remains <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-39393-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seem to confirm her importance</a> and hint at the extent of ancient trade routes and the intricacies of mummification practices, researchers report August 31 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In ancient Egyptian mummification, the viscera would be removed from the body and placed in separate jars along with a balm meant to preserve the organs. To find out exactly how Senetnay’s innards were preserved, archaeological chemist Barbara Huber and colleagues conducted a panel of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/egyptian-mummy-chemical-mixtures">chemical analyses</a> of the residue in the jars that once held her lungs and liver (<em>SN: 2/1/23</em>).</p>



<p>While most other embalming fluids from her era contained simpler mixes of fats, oils and sap, Senetnay’s remains were preserved in a rich blend of substances, the team found. The residue hinted at oils, fats, beeswax, tree resins, the tarlike bitumen and, in a possible first, the sap from larch trees, which grew in the mountains in the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>“We were lucky because we identified one of the richest, most complex mummification balms ever found … especially for this early time period,” says Huber, of the Max Plank Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.</p>



<p>Some of the ingredients may have come as far away as Southeast Asia, the team suggests. This hints that Egyptians may have had certain far-reaching trade routes up to a millennium earlier than previously thought.</p>



<p>The far-flung and diverse ingredients, Huber says, imply that little expense was spared in Senetnay’s preservation, reinforcing her status as a valued member of the pharaoh’s entourage.</p>

<p>A former researcher at the University of Utah has filed for a temporary restraining order against the U.S. government agency that last week barred her from receiving federal funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ivana Frech – formerly Ivana De Domenico – “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly falsifying and/or fabricating” images in three different papers whose work was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-de-domenico-ivana">according to the Office of Research Integrity (ORI)</a>. ORI barred Frech from receiving federal funding for three years starting on August 21, making no mention of whether she agreed to the sanctions.</p>



<p>But on August 29, Jackson Nichols, an attorney representing Frech, filed for a temporary restraining order against the Department of Health and Human Services. The <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2023cv02530/259201">complaint in the case is under seal</a>, and the summons refer only to a “suit to enjoin further action by U.S. government agency” under the Administrative Procedure Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Nichols nor Frech immediately responded to Retraction Watch’s request for comment about the goals of the lawsuit, but the filing is consistent with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/08/13/are-you-liable-for-misconduct-by-scientific-collaborators-what-a-recent-court-decision-means-for-scientists/">others aimed at blocking such debarments</a>.</p>



<p>The case dates back to at least 2012, when Frech and colleagues retracted two papers from <em>Cell Metabolism</em>. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/05/23/authors-retract-two-cell-metabolism-papers-after-data-were-inappropriately-removed-from-the-laboratory/">we reported at the time</a>, <a href="https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/jerry-kaplan">Jerry Kaplan</a>, the senior author of those papers, said “the data were lost when an employee, who was dismissed, discarded lab notebooks without permission.” That employee – who was not a co-author of the paper – was a technician, Kaplan said. “This occurred prior to the identification of errors in the manuscripts and was reported at that time to the University authorities.”</p>



<span id="more-127791"></span>



<p>Asked about the apparent discrepancy between those comments and the ORI placing blame on Frech, Kaplan tells Retraction Watch: “I now think the ORI report was accurate.”</p>



<p>More papers were <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/06/06/two-new-corrections-for-utah-group-that-retracted-two-cell-metabolism-papers-for-missing-notebooks/">corrected that year</a>, and Frech and Kaplan <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/07/01/scientists-whose-papers-were-retracted-and-corrected-leave-university-of-utah/">left the university in 2013</a>. That year, the <em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56676417-78/lab-kaplan-papers-research.html.csp">reported</a> that the university had investigated the case and issued a scathing <a href="http://retractionwatch.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/utah-report.pdf">report</a> in which it said it “could not determine by a preponderance of the evidence that these items were the work of Dr. DeDomenico.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it said that there was misconduct “based on reckless disregard of accepted practice, a finding heavily influenced by the number of departures from established norms over an extended period.” Utah, as required by the assurance agreement governing its acceptance of federal funds, notified the ORI of its findings.</p>



<p>In 2014, the group <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/06/former-university-of-utah-researchers-one-guilty-of-reckless-disregard-have-another-paper-retracted/">retracted another paper</a> from <em>Cell Metabolism</em>. And the ORI said it would request the retraction of a fourth paper, this one <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580708002396">published in 2008</a> in <em>Developmental Cell</em>.</p>



<p>Grants with Frech’s name on them totaled in the millions of dollars while she was at Utah, although she was not principal investigator on all of them. She <a href="https://internalmedicineiowa.org/2018/12/03/december-2018-ivana-frech/">appears to have served</a> as lab manager for Frank Zhan at the University of Iowa for <a href="https://openpayrolls.com/employee/ivana-frech-4285">at least four years</a>. Zhan told a medicine department blog in 2018: “She emphasizes the importance of academic integrity and best lab practices, creating a positive lab culture.”</p>



<p>Update, 8/31/23, 1900 UTC: An HHS spokesperson tells us that Frech missed a deadline to request a hearing in front of a judge about the sanctions:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Under the Public Health Service Policies on Research Misconduct, at 42 C.F.R. Part 93, ORI may make findings of research misconduct and propose administrative actions and notifies a respondent in a charge letter. If debarment is proposed, the charge letter serves as a notice of proposed debarment and is cosigned by the HHS debarring official. The respondent then has 30 days to contest the findings and proposed administrative actions by requesting a hearing in front of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) with the HHS Departmental Appeals Board, or the findings become final. ORI may settle a research misconduct proceeding at any time with a voluntary agreement when it is in the best interests of the Federal government and the public health or welfare. In this case, ORI issued a charge letter, and the respondent did not request a hearing with an ALJ within the 30-day period prescribed by regulation, so the research misconduct findings and proposed administrative actions became the final HHS actions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wegovy-ozempic-treat-addiction">The weight-loss drug Wegovy may also help treat addiction</a></h4>

              
                <p>A class of powerful drugs can dramatically change people’s body weight. But one of the drugs&#8217; most alluring jobs may happen in a spot that’s harder to see: the brain.</p>



<p>Some people taking drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic, two brand names for the drug semaglutide, have reported surprising — and welcome — side effects: Their constant thoughts about food quiet; their desire for alcohol diminishes; their need for nicotine dissipates. </p>



<p>These reports point to the possibility that these drugs, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for type 2 diabetes and obesity, may be repurposed as desperately needed treatments for substance use disorders. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic-strokes-heart#faq">[See also:&nbsp;<strong>Semaglutide FAQ</strong>&nbsp;]</a></p>





<p>That hope sounds like a long shot. But the idea has merit, some researchers think, and that conclusion isn’t based solely on anecdotes. Semaglutide’s potential to reduce a person’s drive for alcohol, tobacco and even opioids comes as no surprise to some addiction researchers, who have been studying earlier cousins of semaglutide for their role in reward-seeking.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s safe to say that the degree of clinical and anecdotal evidence that’s come out recently is fairly unprecedented,” says Christian Hendershot, a clinical psychologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. “So that’s a reason for some optimism and for really wanting to move this area of clinical research forward.”</p>



<p>Hendershot and others are quick to point out that more studies, particularly on large numbers of people, need to be done. What’s more, there are existing medicines that have been proven to help with addictions. But the potential of semaglutide and its relatives as addiction treatments, he says, is real.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Semaglutide and related drugs change addictive behaviors in mice and rats</h4>



<p>One recent study on the potential for semaglutide to curb addiction looked at rats and mice that had already developed excessive alcohol drinking behavior. The experiments were designed to mimic binge drinking and alcohol dependency in people. Rodents that were subsequently dosed with semaglutide <a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/170671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drank less alcohol</a> than rodents that weren’t, addiction physician-scientist Lorenzo Leggio and colleagues reported online May 16 in <em>JCI Insight</em>. Similar <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00207-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results</a> were published June 7 in <em>eBioMedicine</em> by researchers at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.<br><br>Mice on semaglutide also drank less sweet nonalcoholic liquids and unsweetened calorie-rich liquids. That general dampening of consumption wasn&#8217;t a surprise, “because this medication is approved already for obesity, for its ability to reduce appetite and food intake,” says Leggio, of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Baltimore.</p>



<p>Parts of the brain that help drive eating behavior, such as the nucleus accumbens, overlap extensively with the drive to use alcohol or drugs, Leggio says.</p>



<p>These drugs could also help curb opioid addictions, says behavioral neuroscientist Patricia “Sue” Grigson of Penn State College of Medicine. Brianna Evans, a researcher in Grigson’s lab, and colleagues found that liraglutide, a close relative of semaglutide, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923022002210?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced heroin seeking</a> in certain tests of male rats. Those results were published in 2022 in <em>Brain Research Bulletin</em>.</p>



<p>A preliminary study by the same researchers may help explain why — patterns of brain activity change.</p>



<p>Usually, when a rat is looking for a drug, nerve cells in two areas of its brain are active: the outer layer of the nucleus accumbens, which is involved with rewards, and the locus coeruleus, which is involved with withdrawal. That’s not the case for rats on liraglutide that were seeking fentanyl. In these rats, liraglutide seemed to reduce activity in both brain regions, the researchers found. The team expects to present these unpublished results in November at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Washington, D.C.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Several human trials are underway — and researchers are “very, very cautiously optimistic”</h4>





<p>Grigson and her colleagues have nearly finished a clinical trial of liraglutide in people being treated for opioid use disorder at the Caron Treatment Center in Wernersville, Pa. The study is small: Only nine people have completed it, and 16 people are partially done. And the study was short, with participants receiving liraglutide for just 19 days. The results are still blinded, so neither the researchers nor participants know who got liraglutide, or whether it showed an effect.</p>



<p>Other trials are also underway. Hendershot is involved in two trials with semaglutide: one for smokers and one for heavy drinkers. And Leggio is embarking on a clinical trial assessing alcohol use as well.</p>



<p>He and other addiction researchers feel collectively energized, Leggio says. “In my professional life so far, I don’t recall any time like this time,” where scientists have had such intriguing and potentially promising ways to influence addictions.</p>



<p>Although he sees the promise, he’s also been working in the field of addiction long enough to know that some ideas just don’t pan out. “This will not be the first time that we were feeling strongly about something, and we were not correct,” Leggio says. “If we already knew that semaglutide worked, there would be no reason to do the clinical trials.”</p>



<p>That idea is echoed by Andrew Saxon, an addiction psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. The potential for this family of drugs to help with substance use disorders is plausible, says Saxon, whose work hasn’t been focused on semaglutide and drugs like it.</p>



<p>&#8220;There’s encouraging information there,” he says. That said, “I do think that we’ve been repeatedly disappointed by medications that look great in animal studies but don’t pan out that well in humans.&#8221; Overall, he’s “very, very cautiously optimistic,” he says. “But we need to do the studies.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next?</h4>



<p>One of the powerful aspects of these drugs is that they seem to affect lots of different parts of the body, the brain included. That’s because the drugs are designed to mimic the hormone GLP-1. As a result, the drugs can affect the many nerve cells in the brain that respond to GLP-1, either directly or indirectly, Grigson says.</p>



<p>While researchers have some clues about how GLP-1 and its copycats work, scientists don’t know the full details of how nerve cells, and the brain networks they form, are affected. There are still lots of basic questions, including whether semaglutide and its relatives get directly into the brain or exert their effects from other parts of the body.</p>



<p>If the drugs do work to reduce addictions, they, like any medication, won&#8217;t be useful for everyone. Side effects include nausea, digestive trouble and headaches. And while some people are happy to have weight loss as a side effect, some aren’t. People who are underweight, for instance, might not want to take this class of drugs.</p>



<p>This buzzy moment may be overpromising, but researchers won’t know for sure where else the drugs might shine — and where they fall short — until a lot more work is done. Nigel Greig, a neuroscientist who focuses on drug development, is studying drugs that mimic GLP-1 as a possible treatment for Parkinson’s disease. There are hints that the drugs can influence inflammation in the brain, and perhaps stave off brain decline.</p>



<p>Like other researchers, he’s circumspect. “Certain classes of drugs pop up. And when they pop up at the right time, they can do anything and everything,” says Greig, of the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore. “In the end, they won’t do as much as people hope, like every class of drugs. But they do look very intriguing.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/platelet-pf4-aging-brain-longevity">Three ways of rejuvenating aging brains may work via the same protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>A single molecule may play a central role in rejuvenating aging brains, albeit in different ways, new research suggests.</p>



<p>Studies of three different techniques for combating the cognitive decline that accompanies aging found that they all increase levels of a protein called platelet factor four, or PF4, in mice. This in turn improved the animals’ cognitive performance and improved biological signs of brain health, three research groups report August 16 in <em>Nature Aging, Nature</em> and <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>&#8220;PF4 may be an effective factor, and this kind of work will help bring it toward a therapeutic agent&#8221; for age-related cognitive decline, says bioengineer Michael Conboy, of the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>One of the research groups, led by neuroscientist Dena Dubal, of the University of California, San Francisco, was studying klotho, a hormone linked to longevity. The group’s previous studies showed that injecting the hormone into mice boosted cognition, but since klotho molecules are too large to cross the blood-brain-barrier, the researchers concluded that the hormone must act on the brain indirectly via a messenger.</p>



<p>To search for this intermediary, Dubal’s team injected mice with klotho and measured changes in protein levels in the animals’ blood. Levels of platelet factors increased, and PF4 changed the most, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Platelets are a type of immune cell known for their role in wound healing and clotting, and they release proteins called platelet factors into the blood. “My first reaction was, what do platelets have to do with cognitive enhancement? This is crazy,” Dubal says.</p>



<p>Another UCSF team, led by neuroscientist Saul Villeda, had previously shown that blood plasma from young mice rejuvenated the brains of elderly mice. When they looked at how young plasma differed from old, Villeda’s team found it contained much more PF4.</p>



<p>Chatting over coffee, the two scientists shared what they were working on. “We had both, through our independent studies, converged on PF4,” Dubal says.</p>



<p>Soon after, Tara Walker, a neuroscientist at the University of Queensland, Australia, contacted Villeda. Walker’s team had found that exercise boosts PF4, and that delivering PF4 directly to mice’s brains spurred new nerve cell growth, called neurogenesis, in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory. “We said, ‘OK, we need to start having meetings,’” Villeda says.</p>



<p>The new studies all show that PF4, on its own, improves cognition in mice. Walker’s team found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39873-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">injecting PF4 into mice’s bodies also enhances</a> neurogenesis, and that this is required for the cognitive benefits they saw. Dubal’s team found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00468-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PF4 also enhances neural connections in the hippocampus</a>.</p>



<p>Villeda and colleagues were interested in the immune system. “More and more research is pointing toward a link between the immune system, cognitive decline and diseases like Alzheimer’s,” Villeda says. Injecting PF4 into old mice returned their body’s immune systems to a more youthful state, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06436-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowering levels of inflammatory proteins and reducing inflammation in their brains</a>, the team found.</p>



<p>PF4 is a promising new player, but it is one part of a complex puzzle. “These discoveries greatly advance our understanding by unraveling one factor,” says neuroscientist Lida Katsimpardi, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who was not involved in the work. &#8220;We always want to know the full puzzle, but understanding each factor fills in a piece.&#8221;</p>





<p>Katsimpardi studies GDF11, a protein with similar restorative effects, that she and her colleagues have linked to calorie restriction. How big a part any of these proteins play is not yet clear. “This is the question we all have every day,” Katsimpardi says. “Is this the molecule? Or do you need more?”</p>



<p>The main limitation of the new studies is that few findings in mice translate into safe and effective therapies in people. But in humans, as in mice, PF4 declines with age, and human PF4 also improves cognition in mice, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Dubal and colleagues also published a study in July in <em>Nature Aging</em> showing that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00441-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">klotho improves cognition in aging monkeys</a>, whose brains are much more similar to ours, though whether that improvement involves PF4 is not known. “It might be klotho that makes it to humans, or it could be PF4, or both,” Dubal says. “But it&#8217;s important to have multiple shots on goal.”</p>



<p>Ways of fighting brain aging that scientists already know work, such as exercise and calorie restriction, are often not an option for those most in need. “We know exercise is great, but you can&#8217;t do it because you&#8217;re frail. Same with calorie restriction,” Villeda says. Research like this aims to discover how these activities rejuvenate the brain and to identify molecules that mimic their effects.</p>



<p>The researchers plan to start testing treatments based on PF4 in humans within the next few years, Villeda says, but it will be important to watch for side effects. Future studies will also need to pin down exactly how PF4 acts in the body and brain, and whether it should ultimately be part of a therapeutic cocktail, Conboy says.</p>

<p>On July 21, Derek Woollins received an email asking that an article be withdrawn from a journal he supposedly helped edit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But although Woollins was listed on the journal’s website as a member of its editorial board, he had never even heard of the publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Woollins, a professor of synthetic chemistry at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, later learned that he is also listed on the editorial board of other journals from the same publisher – &nbsp;Scholars Research Library – again, with no involvement in any of them. (Some academics have even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/26/frankly-abusive-more-questions-about-the-journal-that-stole-an-authors-identity/">found themselves</a> listed as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/24/how-many-times-can-a-journal-be-hijacked/">editors in chief</a> of journals they have nothing to do with.)</p>



<p>Woollins told us:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127786"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This publisher is behaving in an unethical and misleading way.. sadly if this is how the editorial board is convened it seems unlikely that the published articles can be properly peer reviewed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article Woollins was contacted about, “<a href="https://www.derpharmachemica.com/pharma-chemica/the-effect-of-aromatherapy-with-the-essential-oil-of-orange-on-pain-and-vital-signs-of-patients-with-fractured-limbs-admitted-to-t-11851.html">The Effect of Aromatherapy with the Essential Oil of Orange on Pain and Vital Signs of Patients with Fractured Limbs Admitted to the Emergency Ward: A Randomized Clinical Trial</a>,” was published in<em> Der Pharma Chemica</em> in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was also published the same year with slightly different wording in the <a href="https://cejnm.osu.cz/artkey/cjn-201704-0003_the-effect-of-aromatherapy-with-orange-essential-oil-on-anxiety-and-pain-in-patients-with-fractured.php"><em>Central European Journal of Nursing and Midwifer</em>y</a> (CEJNW) and the <a href="https://jpalliativecare.com/the-effect-of-aromatherapy-with-the-essential-oil-of-orange-on-pain-and-vital-signs-of-patients-with-fractured-limbs-admitted-to-the-emergency-ward-a-randomized-clinical-trial/"><em>Indian Journal of Palliative Care</em></a>. The latter version has been cited 13 times, while the other versions are not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science. No version of the article has yet been retracted.</p>



<p>The email Woollins received was from Darja Jarosova, Editor in Chief of CEJNW, informing him of the duplicate publications.&nbsp;In response, Woolins forwarded the email to the journal’s publisher, adding:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have never given my permission for you to make me editor of this journal. This is damaging my academic reputation. Using my name as editor without permission is surely totally inappropriate and illegal. I will seek legal advice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Woollins told us he had never heard of <em>Der Pharma Chemica</em> before Jarosova’s email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a further exchange, Jarosova told Woollins that his name was also listed on the editorial board of several other journals by the same publisher, including <em>Archives of Applied Science Research</em>, the <em>Journal of Natural Product and Plant Resources</em>, the<em> European Journal of Applied Engineering and Scientific Research</em>, and the <em>Central European Journal of Experimental Biology</em>. Woollins doesn’t edit any of those titles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Woollins said Scholars Research Library, based in the United Kingdom, has not yet responded to his email.</p>



<p>Jarosova did not respond to an email from Retraction Watch. In <s>his</s> her email to Woollins, <s>he</s> she wrote: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors have signed a license agreement for this article for our journal CEJNM, where they confirm that the article has not been published anywhere or sent to another journal.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mexican-virologist-susana-lopez-charreton-rotaviruses-rna">Mexican virologist Susana López Charretón uncovered rotaviruses’ secrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Susana López Charretón is among Mexico’s leading virologists. She has been awarded the UNESCO–Carlos J. Finlay Prize for Microbiology and the L’Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science award. She’s the only female Mexican scientist to have edited the <em>Journal of Virology</em>.</p>



<p>But winning prizes isn’t what inspires her science and her career. “Prizes and recognition are just a consequence,” she says. “Actually, I’m mostly embarrassed by them.”</p>



<p>Instead, it’s curiosity and a thirst for understanding and solving problems that drive her. “To me science is a way of living, something that fulfills me completely,” López Charretón says.</p>





<p>For four decades, she has devoted her life to studying how rotaviruses infect human cells. These double-stranded RNA viruses were described in 1973 by Australian virologist Ruth Bishop and colleagues, when those researchers discovered a virus particle present in the intestinal tissue of children with diarrhea.</p>



<p>Known to cause severe gastroenteritis, including acute diarrhea, vomiting, fever and dehydration, rotaviruses mainly affect babies and small children. Worldwide, the viruses are responsible for the deaths of some 100,000 or more children ages 5 and under every year.</p>



<p>Those numbers used to be more than twice as high. Vaccines, introduced in 2006, dramatically reduced the burden of disease. It was research from a team led by López Charretón and her husband, Carlos Arias Ortiz, along with the work of others around the world, that built the scientific foundation for the development of the vaccines.</p>



<p>López Charretón started studying rotaviruses in the late 1970s, when they were still new to science. “They had just been discovered, so we were able to make important contributions,” she says.</p>

<p>Alongside Arias Ortiz, she defined the multistep processes and the specific molecular players that allow the viruses to invade the cells of the intestine and rapidly replicate their genetic material, the first steps in rotavirus infection and gastroenteritis.<br><br>“Science is mostly a series of small steps that move knowledge forward,” says Harry Greenberg, an American virologist now retired from Stanford University. “Over the time Susana has been working on rotaviruses, a bunch of vaccines have been made,” he says. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Always a scientist</h4>



<p>López Charretón knew that she wanted to be a scientist from a young age. As a child, she loved conducting home experiments, like freezing dead flies or opening up dead lizards to explore their insides.</p>



<p>Her mom and dad, unlike most parents of young women at the time, had no problem with her wanting to dedicate her life to studying. With their support, she studied basic biomedical research at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, in Mexico City.</p>



<p>López Charretón’s tutor, Romilio Espejo, a Chilean virologist who had moved to Mexico, was studying rotaviruses and introduced her to them. She became increasingly fascinated by their complexity and wanted to understand them. “Rotaviruses cause very serious problems in the world,” she says.</p>





<p>Around that time, López Charretón also met Carlos Arias, who was doing a master’s degree in Espejo’s lab. She stayed on at UNAM for a master’s degree and Ph.D., and she and Carlos Arias went to California from 1981 to 1983 for a research sabbatical in the Caltech laboratory of biologist James Strauss. There, they continued the work they had begun with Espejo. “This was my path to realize that virology was what most interested me,” she explains.</p>



<p>Back in Mexico, the couple formed a research group at the Institute of Biotechnology at UNAM and continued to study rotaviruses. At the time, most scientists thought rotaviruses invaded cells in a relatively simple process, with just one viral protein interacting with one cell receptor.</p>



<p>Instead, the group showed, rotavirus entry into a host cell is mediated by multiple steps and interactions with the surface of the cell. These steps take place in a specific part of the cell’s plasma membrane known as lipid rafts and end with the virus entering through endocytosis, a cellular process in which a substance is surrounded by an area of the cell’s membrane to form a vesicle that transports the substance into the cell.</p>



<p>López Charretón’s group also <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described the molecules</a> that help rotaviruses beat the body’s innate antiviral system. Two viral proteins that play multiple roles directly interact with the cells of the intestine and prevent the antiviral response. This finding could explain why the viruses are so specific in the cells they infect.</p>



<p>Theirs is now the prevailing model describing how rotaviruses invade cells. “All viruses establish these types of battles with their host cells, and the amazing part is that each virus has different tools to do it,” López Charretón says.</p>



<p>López Charretón continues to work on rotaviruses, trying to figure out how they pervert the entire cellular machinery within intestinal cells. But in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, she was part of a group of virologists charged with monitoring and sequencing the coronavirus strains circulating in the country.<br><br>She and other virologists founded the multi-institutional Genomic Surveillance Consortium of Mexico. Though the group planned to continue monitoring other viruses following the pandemic, it has disbanded because of a lack of financial support from the government.</p>



<p>The effort emphasized for López Charretón the importance of growing Mexico’s pool of scientists. “With the pandemic, it became obvious that we don’t have enough people who are experts in virology in order to face these types of problems,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A mentor for aspiring scientists</h4>



<p>She has worked to build that scientist pipeline throughout her career, by helping to train young virologists who are just as driven as she is. “[As a scientist,] you also have the joy of sharing your passion with your students, watching them grow and becoming very rigorous in their craft,” she says.</p>



<p>Besides being a leading scientist, says Greenberg, one of López Charretón’s most outstanding traits is her willingness to teach. Three of her students have gone on to do postdocs in Greenberg’s lab. He has observed how close they are to her and how well trained they are; he says she’s probably the most caring and attentive mentor he has ever met.</p>



<p>Liliana Sánchez Tacuba, who did a Ph.D. with López Charretón before moving on to Greenberg’s lab for a postdoc, agrees that, unlike a lot of lab leaders, López Charretón makes time to dedicate herself to teaching. “I couldn’t have had a better tutor,” Sánchez Tacuba says. “She is my academic mom and every time I have difficulty or doubts, I still contact her.”<br><br>Sánchez Tacuba comes from a small, low-income community in the state of Guerrero, Mexico, where most women study only through primary school. Today, she is a research scientist in the microbiology division at Vir Biotechnology, an American immunology company focused on treating and preventing infectious diseases.</p>



<p>All of this was possible because of López Charretón, Sánchez Tacuba says, and the time and effort López Charretón dedicated to mentoring her. “She changed my life,” Sánchez Tacuba says. “Every time I’ve second-guessed myself, I’ve thought that if Susana López believes in me, then I must be able to do it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic-strokes-heart">What we still don’t know about Wegovy’s effect on strokes and heart attacks</a></h4>

              
                <p>A diabetes-turned-weight-loss medication could be on the verge of scoring a hat trick: It may also be a cardiovascular wonder drug.</p>



<p>But limited results from a new and closely watched clinical trial have raised a flurry of questions. Who benefited from the drug and how long did they need to be treated? What were the side effects? And are the newly reported cardiovascular effects driven by weight loss, or is the medication working in some other way? <a href="#faq" data-type="internal" data-id="#faq">[ Skip down to: <strong>Semaglutide FAQ</strong> ]</a></p>





<p>First approved as a diabetes drug, the molecule semaglutide mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. This hormone typically suffuses into our bloodstreams after we eat and makes us feel full, among other actions. Semaglutide essentially gives people an extra dose of that full-feeling hormone.</p>



<p>Taking the drug can lead to dramatic weight loss — and now, it appears, better cardiovascular health, even in people without diabetes. At least, that’s the take-home message of early clinical trial results released by Novo Nordisk, the drug’s maker, on August 8. Weekly injections of semaglutide in overweight or obese adults <a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=166301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut the risk of serious heart or blood vessel problems by 20 percent</a>, the company, headquartered near Copenhagen, reported.</p>



<p>“It’s quite a big deal,” says David Strain, a physician at the University of Exeter Medical School in England who helped recruit patients for the trial but was not involved in collecting data and has not seen the study’s full results. “This is the first time that a drug for weight loss has shown benefits above and beyond the weight loss itself.”</p>



<p>Headlines have hailed the trial as a landmark. The study’s early results served up the tantalizing idea that semaglutide might prevent strokes or heart attacks in a broad group of people. In the United States alone, more <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm#:~:text=Every%20year%2C%20more%20than%C2%A0795%2C000%20people%C2%A0in%20the%20United%20States%20have%20a%20stroke.%20About%20610%2C000%20of%20these%20are%20first%20or%20new%20strokes." target="_blank" rel="noopener">than 795,000 people have strokes</a> every year and about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm#:~:text=Every%20year%2C%20about%20805%2C000%20people,States%20have%20a%20heart%20attack.&amp;text=Of%20these%2C,are%20a%20first%20heart%20attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">805,000 people have heart attacks</a>.</p>



<p>But Novo Nordisk’s brief report is sparse on details and has left many doctors and scientists awaiting the trial’s full findings. Scientists involved with the trial plan to present more information later this year.</p>



<p>Before making any judgments or recommendations, says cardiologist Michelle Albert of the University of California, San Francisco, the study needs to be peer-reviewed. “If the results seem sound,” says Albert, a former president of the American Heart Association, the study “opens the door for a wider range of folks benefiting from this medication. But this is all a big if.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other studies have suggested semaglutide has cardiovascular benefits</h4>



<p>Semaglutide’s path to the public has been a long one. Since the mid-2000s, scientists have launched more than 300 clinical trials testing the drug. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved semaglutide for use in people with type 2 diabetes, sold under the brand name Ozempic. It is now for sale in self-administered injector pens containing up to 2 milligrams of semaglutide.</p>



<p>About four years after Ozempic got the green light, the FDA approved a higher-dose, 2.4-milligram version of semaglutide (under the brand name Wegovy) specifically for weight management. People treated with the drug tend to be less hungry, have fewer cravings and feel more satiated after eating than those not on the drug — all factors that may translate to weight loss. In one 2021 study, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people treated with the drug for more than a year lost about 15 kilograms</a>. People who instead received a placebo lost less than 3 kilograms.</p>



<p>Other studies have unearthed cardiovascular clues suggesting semaglutide may do more than simply help people shed pounds. In a small trial of people with obesity and one type of heart failure, a year’s treatment with the drug <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2306963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed to improve physical abilities</a>, researchers reported August 25 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. And last year, Strain and colleagues reported that <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.037775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semaglutide lowered the risk of stroke</a> in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. How exactly it works remains unclear, Strain says, but it’s possible the drug reduces damage from blood flow blockages in the brain.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stroke reduction</h3>



<p>In 2022, physician David Strain and colleagues reported an analysis of two clinical trials that measured the cardiovascular benefits of semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Over the roughly two years since the trials began, people with no prior history of stroke were less likely to experience one while being treated with semaglutide (dark blue) compared to those who received a placebo (light blue).</p>

<p>That kind of secondary effect may help explain the results of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870320302143?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Novo Nordisk’s current clinical trial, called SELECT</a>, which enrolled more than 17,000 adults age 45 and older. The trial evaluated semaglutide’s effects in people who were overweight or obese. These people did not have diabetes, but they did have cardiovascular disease, which affects the heart or blood vessels. Weekly injections reduced the number of fatal or nonfatal strokes and heart attacks, the company reported. A smaller trial funded by Novo Nordisk in 2016 reported <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar results in people with diabetes</a> treated with the drug.</p>



<p>But there are big questions raised by the company’s current trial that still need to be answered, Strain says. For example, how long do the cardiovascular benefits persist after people go off the drug? Weight loss, at least, doesn’t seem to endure. In one 2022 study, <a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14725" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people regained two-thirds of the weight they had lost</a> a&nbsp;year after stopping the medication. And how much of Wegovy’s cardiovascular benefits are due to slimming down versus other ways semaglutide may be tinkering with the body?</p>



<p>Strain suspects that weight is not the only factor. In his stroke study, his team noticed that stroke risk fell relatively quickly — before study participants lost a significant amount of weight. “That was the biggest surprise to us,” he says. “You start seeing the benefit within a few months after starting the drug.” He’s expecting to see something similar with the SELECT trial. But teasing out the different ways semaglutide affects cardiovascular health “is going to take a lot of unpacking,” he says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Who might benefit from taking semaglutide for cardiovascular health?</h4>



<p>UCSF’s Albert has questions about the trial’s participants. “We just know bare bones information about the population,” she says. How many of them stuck with the drug regimen and for how long? And do the drug’s side effects offset its potential utility? Semaglutide can roil the stomach, causing nasty issues like nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.</p>



<p>She also wonders which participants saw the reported cardiovascular benefits. “What’s their racial and ethnic background? What’s their gender? What’s their income level?” she asks. People don’t become overweight in a vacuum, Albert says. Weight issues often start in childhood and can relate to finances, neighborhood access to healthy foods and socioeconomic status. She’s curious if semaglutide’s effects are uniform across different subgroups of people.</p>



<p>A complete picture of a study’s findings can be difficult to piece together from a press release, says Andres Acosta, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “It’s important that we wait for the full manuscript to look at the details of the results.” But the tidbits Novo Nordisk has released are certainly intriguing, he says.</p>



<p>Acosta is hopeful that more insurance companies will consider covering anti-obesity drugs for weight loss. Currently, the list price for Wegovy is about $1,350 per month. “That’s huge,” Albert says. “How many people can afford that?”</p>



<p>Acosta also thinks the study might help the public view obesity in a new light. In the United States, roughly 120 million people — about a third of the country’s population — are obese. Worldwide, that number surges to more than a billion.</p>



<p>“Many people still think that obesity is a disease that is purely cosmetic,” Acosta says. But studies like the Novo Nordisk trial suggest that treating obesity isn’t just about looks, he says. It’s about saving lives. “We need to stop ignoring the problem,” he says. We’re entering a new era where “obesity should be treated — and treated seriously.”</p>

<h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>What are Wegovy and Ozempic?</strong></h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>These drugs are brand names for a molecule called semaglutide. Ozempic was first approved to treat type 2 diabetes; Wegovy is a higher-dose version of semaglutide that’s prescribed for weight loss. Both drugs are currently injected once weekly. A different brand, Rybelsus, is available as a daily pill. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1692975843983" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>How do <strong>Wegovy and Ozempic</strong> work?</strong> </h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>A molecular copycat, semaglutide mimics a hormone made in the gut and the brain stem called GLP-1. After a meal, our gut produces this hormone, which acts on the body in different ways. GLP-1 tells our bodies to make more insulin, which lowers blood sugar levels. It can also tell our brains that we’re full. Semaglutide tricks people’s bodies into thinking there is more GLP-1, but the full picture of how it works is murky. GLP-1 receptors exist throughout the body; semaglutide may also affect the liver, stomach, blood vessels and intestines. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1692975867945" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question "><strong>What drugs are similar to semaglutide?</strong></h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Relatives of semaglutide are coming soon — or already here. Mounjaro, the brand name for a diabetes drug called tirzepatide, imitates both GLP-1 and another hormone called GIP. Retatrutide, an injected drug currently in clinical trials, takes on an additional role, acting like GLP-1, GIP and the pancreatic hormone glucagon. These molecular combinations may offer more opportunities to target diabetes and obesity. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-gendered-brain-a-review">The Gendered Brain: A Review</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Carly Hood reviews Gina Rippon's book, The Gendered Brain, highlighting why we must move on from searching for sex differences in the brain, and how science has been inappropriately used to support the gender roles agenda.</strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ab3bf6_92dfdd9cf0c240fbb772b223c3939f36~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>In her book <em>The Gendered Brain – The New Neuroscience that Shatters the Myth of the Female Brain</em>, cognitive neuroscientist Gina Rippon vividly dissects the prevalent desire to use biology to fully explain, or even support, gendered societal norms. </p>

<p>As an international expert on neuroimaging techniques, Rippon has a clear-sighted vantage point from which to appraise the study of sex/gender differences in the brain. What she found was not only a lack of conclusive evidence for sex-differences, but a field that is complicit in the hunt for one. From this came the polemic that is <em>The Gendered Brain</em>. It begins by tracing the evolution of essentialism – the prevailing idea that the brain is built on one of two distinct biological templates male or female – and deftly uproots it. Essentialism is born of the belief that women’s brains are inferior, deficient or fragile. This inferiority corresponds to a diminished cognitive capacity which, in turn, is used to justify women’s subordinate place in society. Sound science should begin with a question, but all too often in the field of sex-differences, it begins with an assumption that emerged long before we were able to examine it in any empirical way. </p>
<blockquote>Rippon gifts readers with the skill set to critically examine science and gently challenge how it is viewed as an arbiter of truth</blockquote>
<p>The first section provides a sweeping overview of how science has been used to support essentialism. The hunt for a sex-difference is demonstrated in how various methodologies, from measuring skull capacity using birdseed to phrenology, were repeatedly discarded as they did not reveal the desired differences between male and female brains. As movements that demanded increased access to education, property and political power for women gained momentum, so did the drive to find a biological template that irrefutably proved that gender roles are fixed and innate. As more modern methodologies such as neuroimaging still did not find reliable anatomical differences between the two, the rhetoric shifted to a “complementary” approach. This asserts that although females have deficits in skills such as spatial cognition, they have “compensating” skills in the form of empathy and intuition. Conveniently, these skills are better suited to roles that limit their influence in public spheres of society, say, science or politics. Even as studies have not been able to find sex-based differences in specific skills, the argument has transfigured again to say that females, though competent, are simply less interested in scientific professions. This particular argument has been used to justify gender gaps in STEM subjects.  </p>

<p>Importantly, Rippon uses her knowledge of neuroimaging to hone in on how the advent of such techniques, viewed as “a window into the brain”, have propelled the narrative of a sex-based brain difference in the mainstream consciousness. With features from endocrinology and psychology, the latest scientific results are taken as revelatory in neuroscientific research. The results are reported and cited in professional journals that are then picked up in popular press as “established scientific findings”, complete with brightly coloured figures of brains to curate the credibility. What is less readily reported, however, is the bias of researchers that influence experimental designs, inadequate controls, weak statistical power, spurious correlations, misinterpretation and publication bias that sex-difference research is riddled with. At best, such research can be re-interpreted in the light of new findings, at worst, labelled intellectual rubbish. Rippon refers to it as “neurotrash” and highlights its ubiquity in a way that others have been reluctant to. </p>
<blockquote>When children are raised in a society that observes sex-based differences, their developing brains form different expectations</blockquote>
<p>After her cross-disciplinary description of how brain-based sex biases have come to dominate the public consciousness, Rippon arrives at the main thesis of her work: a gendered world will produce a gendered brain. Gina Rippon is not a sex-difference denier. What she aims to communicate is that sex is only <em>one</em> of the many variables that determine the brain - and our social environments have a major stake. The final section of her book is a powerful delivery of how the brain, with its life-long plasticity, is influenced by the rules of social engagement. Rippon seamlessly weaves together studies from fields such as developmental psychology and neuroscience to illustrate how this process begins at birth. Children, referred to as “social sponges”, constantly monitor their social environment. When children are raised in a society that observes sex-based differences, their developing brains form different expectations, leading to different social experiences. Brains encode every social interaction with emotions to either reinforce or avoid a given interaction with the world, and it is this that largely drives males and females down different trajectories. By deftly shifting the focus from limitations imposed by innate biology to those of cultural ideas, Rippon posits an outside-in theory that gives a starting point for a discussion that is still very much needed. </p>

<p>The strength of <em>The Gendered Brain</em> lies in its framing of this discussion. In the first section, Rippon gifts readers with the skill set to critically examine science and gently challenge how it is viewed as an arbiter of truth. For those <em>within</em> the field, this appraisal serves as a reminder of the influence society has on scientific practice and the potential of science to hinder progress just as adeptly as it can propagate it. After dispelling the scientific legitimacy of a “female” brain, Rippon demonstrates how we can more appropriately conceptualise the brain as a dynamic interface between biology and social environment. By discarding the rigid, binary template, we allow for conversations that include people who are non-cis and non-binary, previously excluded in the sex-difference debate. This is one of many positive changes that may precipitate. As the idea that “the brain, as plastic and mouldable as [it is] known to be, reflects more so the [life] lived, not the sex” gains traction, we are free to consider a society where our brains are not diverted down a sex-based pathway. </p><hr><p>This article was written by Carly Hood and edited by Ailie McWhinnie.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-upcycle-soap-surfactant">Chemists turned plastic waste into tiny bars of soap</a></h4>

              
                <p>The time may be coming to wash our hands of plastic trash. Literally.</p>



<p>About 60 percent of all plastic ever made ends up in landfills or littering the environment. Only about one-tenth of plastic waste is ever recycled, and much of that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">ends up being low-quality material reused in things like park benches </a>(<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>). So chemists are searching for ways to “upcycle” plastic into more valuable raw materials.</p>



<p>Now, there’s a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh0993" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way to turn old plastic into surfactants</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 10 <em>Science.</em> Surfactants make up the key ingredients in dozens of products like lubricants, ski wax, detergents and soap.</p>





<p>“To me, plastic waste basically [is] aboveground crude oil,” says chemist Guoliang Liu of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. “We don’t have to go deep into the ocean or underground to mine [it] anymore” to make valuable chemicals. </p>



<p>Surfactants and the two most used kinds of plastic, polyethylene and polypropylene, are made of molecular chains of carbon atoms. But surfactants’ chains are far shorter than those of plastics and are capped with groups of water-attracting atoms.</p>



<p>To turn plastic into surfactants, Liu and colleagues developed a special reactor that carefully heats and condenses plastic into a wax with short carbon chains. By capping the wax’s chains with groups of oxygen atoms and treating them with an alkaline solution, the researchers turned the wax into surfactant. Combining the surfactant with a bit of dye and fragrance produced tiny bars of soap.</p>



<p>Still, upcycled plastic probably won’t be washing away messes any time soon. The researchers can make only about half a gram of surfactant at a time. If Liu and his team can figure out a way to scale up the process, they hope to partner with industry to make plastic waste a bit cleaner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lucid-dream-sleep-mind-neuroscience-brain">Here’s what lucid dreamers might tell us about our sleeping minds</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">When Christopher Mazurek realizes he’s dreaming, it’s always the small stuff that tips him off.</p>



<p>The first time it happened, Mazurek was a freshman at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. In the dream, he found himself in a campus dining hall. It was winter, but Mazurek wasn’t wearing his favorite coat.</p>



<p>“I realized that, OK, if I don’t have the coat, I must be dreaming,” Mazurek says. That epiphany rocked the dream like an earthquake. “Gravity shifted, and I was flung down a hallway that seemed to go on for miles,” he says. “My left arm disappeared, and then I woke up.”</p>





<p>Most people rarely if ever realize that they’re dreaming while it’s happening, what’s known as lucid dreaming. But some enthusiasts have cultivated techniques to become self-aware in their sleep and even wrest some control over their dream selves and settings. Mazurek, 24, says that he’s gotten better at molding his lucid dreams since that first whirlwind experience, sometimes taking them as opportunities to try flying or say hi to deceased family members.</p>



<p>Other lucid dreamers have used their personal virtual realities to plumb their subconscious minds for insights or feast on junk food without real-world consequences. But now, scientists have a new job for lucid dreamers: to explore their dreamscapes and report out in real time.</p>



<p>Dream research has traditionally relied on reports collected after someone wakes up. But people often wake with only spotty, distorted memories of what they dreamed. The dreamers can’t say exactly when events occurred, and they certainly can’t tailor their dreams to specific scientific studies.</p>

<p>“The special thing about lucid dreaming is that you can get even closer to dream content and in a much more controlled and systematic fashion,” says Martin Dresler, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Donders Institute in Nijmegen, Netherlands.</p>



<p>Lucid dreamers who can perform assigned tasks and communicate with researchers during a dream open up tantalizing opportunities to study an otherwise untouchable realm. They are like the astronauts of the dream world, serving as envoys to the mysterious inner spaces created by slumbering minds.</p>



<p>So far, tests in very small groups of lucid dreamers suggest that the strange realities we visit in sleep may be experienced more like the real world than imagined ones. With more emissaries enlisted, researchers hope to probe how sleeping brains construct their elaborate, often bizarre plots and set pieces. Besides satisfying age-old curiosity, this work may point to new ways to treat nightmares. Lucid dream studies could also offer clues about how dreams contribute to creativity, regulating emotions or other cognitive jobs — helping solve the grand mystery of why we dream.</p>



<p>But there are still a lot of problems to solve before lucid dreaming research can really take off. Chief among them is that very few dreamers can become lucid on demand in the lab. Those who can often struggle to do scientists’ bidding or communicate with the waking world. Pinpointing the best techniques to give more people more lucid dreams may assuage those issues. But even if it does, not all scientists agree on what lucid dreams can tell us about the far more common, nonlucid kind.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Are lucid dreams real?</h4>





<p>Tales of lucid dreams date back to antiquity. Aristotle may have been the first to mention them in Western literature in his treatise <em>On Dreams</em>. “Often when one is asleep,” he wrote, “there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream.”</p>



<p>If Aristotle had lucid dreams often, though, he was probably an outlier. Only <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780323242882000520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about half of people say they’ve ever had a lucid dream</a>, while a mere 1&nbsp;percent or so say they lucid dream multiple times a week. Modern enthusiasts use various techniques to boost their likelihood of lucid dreaming — such as repeatedly telling themselves before bedtime that they will have a lucid dream, or making a habit of checking whether they’re awake several times a day in the hopes that this routine carries over into their dreams, where a self-check may help them realize they’re asleep. But those practices don’t guarantee lucidity.</p>



<p>The rarity of lucid dreaming may be why modern science took some convincing that it’s even real. For millennia, lucid dreamers’ own testimonies were the only evidence that someone could be self-aware while catching z’s. Some scientists wondered if so-called lucid dreams were just brief waking hallucinations between bouts of sleep.</p>



<p>But within the last few decades, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.1981.52.3.727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiments have offered proof</a> that lucid dreams are truly what they seem. It turns out, when someone in a dream purposely sweeps their gaze all the way left, then all the way right, their eyes can match those movements behind closed lids in real life. These motions, measured by electrodes near the eyes, stand out from the smaller optical jitters typical of REM sleep, when most lucid dreams happen. This <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior-5">gives dreamers a crude way to signal</a> they’ve become lucid or send other messages to the outside world (<em>SN: 9/19/81, p. 183</em>). Meanwhile, brain waves and muscle paralysis throughout the rest of the body confirm that the dreamer is indeed asleep.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Eyes on eye movements</h3>



<p>A person’s eyes can smoothly track left and right movements when they are awake or in a lucid dream. But when someone closes their eyes and tries to imagine tracking that motion, their eyes pan in small jumps, suggesting that lucid dreams are experienced more like waking perception.</p>

<p>Neuroscientists are just beginning to realize the potential of that line of communication. Lucid dream research “has been enjoying a renaissance over the last decade,” says neuroscientist Tore Nielsen. He directs the Dream &amp; Nightmare Laboratory at the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine in Montreal. “This renaissance has made it one of the cutting-edge areas of dream study.”</p>



<p>One research team recently deployed experienced lucid dreamers to find out whether dream imagery is more like real-life visuals or imagined ones. While asleep, six lucid dreamers moved their thumbs in either a circle or a line (or both) and traced that motion with their eyes. Participants repeated the same task while awake with their eyes open and in their imaginations with their eyes closed. People’s gazes panned jerkily when they tracked the imagined movements, as though they were viewing something in low resolution. But in dreams, people’s eyes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05547-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracked the movements smoothly</a> just as in real life, the team reported in 2018 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s been debated really all the way back to the ancient Greeks, are dreams more like imagination, or is it more like perception?” says study coauthor Benjamin Baird, a cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Austin. “The smooth tracking data suggests that, at least in that sense, the imagery is more like perception.”</p>



<p>This and <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982211010311?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982211010311%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other early experiments</a> offer a taste of what dreamstronauts could teach us. But any conclusions based on just a handful of dreamers have to be taken with a grain of salt. “They’re more like proof-of-concept studies,” says Michelle Carr, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine. “It needs to be studied in bigger samples.”</p>



<p>That means finding — or creating — more expert lucid dreamers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Strategies for lucid dreaming</h4>



<p>If you want to have a lucid dream, there are a few strategies you can use to up your chances. Besides regularly questioning whether you’re awake and setting an intention before bed to become lucid, you can keep a dream diary. Getting familiar with common characters, events or themes in your dreams may help you recognize when you’re dreaming. Some aspiring lucid dreamers also use a tactic called “wake-back-to-bed.” They wake up extremely early in the morning, stay up for a while, then get more shut-eye. That jolt of alertness right before tumbling back into REM sleep may help them become lucid in a dream.</p>



<p>Such techniques can be hit-or-miss, though. And data on their effectiveness are still pretty murky, Baird says. One study with about 170 Australians, for instance, suggested that checking if you’re awake, setting an intention to become lucid and doing wake-back-to-bed all together <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-40360-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can increase your odds of lucid dreaming</a>. But it wasn’t as clear if using just one or two of those practices worked.</p>



<p>Investigations by Baird and others have shown that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the supplement galantamine promotes lucid dreaming</a>, probably by fiddling with neurotransmitters involved in REM sleep. But galantamine can be saddled with side effects such as nausea. And although lucidity itself <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810020300301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does not appear to spoil sleep quality</a>, the long-term effects of using galantamine are not well-known. “Personally, I wouldn’t be mucking around with my neurotransmitters every night,” Baird says.</p>



<p>In 2020, Carr and colleagues reported that they’d <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fcns0000227" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coaxed 14 of 28 nappers to become lucid</a> in the lab — including three people who’d never before lucid dreamed — no drugs necessary. Before falling asleep, participants learned to associate a cue, such as a series of beeps, with self-awareness. Hearing the same sound again while sleeping reminded them to become lucid. Carr is particularly interested in finding out whether lucid dreaming can help people conquer nightmares, but researchers at Northwestern use the sensory cue strategy to get more lucid emissaries to carry out dream tasks for their experiments.</p>

<p>“Our method is kind of a shortcut,” says Northwestern cognitive neuroscientist Ken Paller. It doesn’t require a lot of mental training or the grueling sleep interruptions that some other lucid dreaming techniques do.</p>



<p>Another shortcut for researchers is to recruit dreamers from a special slice of the population: people with narcolepsy, who are liable to fall asleep suddenly during the day.</p>



<p>“They’re just champions at lucid dreams,” says Isabelle Arnulf, a sleep neurologist who heads the sleep disorders clinic at Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital in Paris.</p>



<p>In 2018, Arnulf’s team reported a study where <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21067-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 of 21 narcolepsy patients signaled lucidity during lab naps</a>. Even with those impressive numbers, a couple of lucid nappers still couldn’t control their dreams well enough to complete their assignment: to do something in a dream that made them briefly stop breathing, such as swimming underwater or speaking. One said after waking that they’d simply forgotten to stop breathing while diving off a cliff, while another said they tried to speak but couldn’t get any words out.</p>



<p>Staying lucid and successfully wrangling dream scenarios present challenges for lucid dreamers — and the scientists relying on them. In one study, lucid dreamers instructed to fill a dream room with objects, such as a clock and a rubber snake, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810020300295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran into problems</a>; the clock spun wildly, or the snake slithered away. In another experiment, lucid dreamers asked to practice throwing darts <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2016.1267387" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were waylaid</a> by only having pencils to throw or being pelted with darts by a nasty doll.</p>



<p>“It’s a lot harder than just passively lucid dreaming in your bed,” says Mazurek, who has participated in several lucid dream studies at Northwestern. “You realize, ‘OK, I have to stabilize the dream. I have to remember what the task is. I have to do the task without the dream falling apart.’ ”</p>



<p>Missions to the moon may be hard, but at least astronauts don’t have to worry about forgetting who or where they are, or their spaceship suddenly turning into a banana.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, lucid dream expeditions are forging ahead — and fast. In fact, an international crew of dreamfarers, including Mazurek, recently embarked on their most ambitious mission yet.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Real-time dream science</h4>



<p>When it comes to getting on-the-ground data, interviewing dreamers in real time is, well, the dream. Instead of just sitting back and watching dreamers do various activities, researchers could ask these agents about their experiences moment to moment, painting the realm of dreams in sharper detail than ever before.</p>



<p>“Reports of dreamed sensations, [such as] tasting certain foods, can be compared with those of actual sensations,” Nielsen says. “Similarly, one could test whether sexual pleasure, certain sounds or other types of experiences are accurately simulated.” These details, he says, might help “probe the limits and mechanisms of dream production.”</p>



<p>Karen Konkoly is especially excited about giving people assignments mid-dream. Say researchers want to know how much dreams help with creative problem-solving. If dreamers are assigned a problem before sleep, they’re liable to mull it over as they nod off. “Even if it feels like the lucid dream, maybe it’s really the time <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-creativity-neuroscience-brain">as you’re falling asleep that helped</a> you solve the problem,” says Konkoly, a cognitive neuroscientist at Northwestern. Airdropping a puzzle straight into a dream could better isolate the usefulness of that specific part of sleep.</p>



<p>There’s a whole medley of theories about why people dream, from honing skills to tapping into creativity to processing memories or emotions. “But if you can’t control the dream in real time and then study the outcome, then you never know … if the dream is really doing anything,” Konkoly says. So a few years ago, she, Arnulf, Dresler and others decided to find out if people can receive and respond to outside input while dreaming.</p>



<p>Thirty-six people took snoozes at Northwestern, Arnulf’s lab, Dresler’s lab or another lab that was in Germany. Once sleepers signaled that they were lucid, researchers spoke yes-or-no questions or math problems in the sleepers’ ears. Or, for the Germans, lights flashing different colors conveyed math questions in Morse code. Before conking out, dreamers were told to answer whatever questions they received with eye signals or by smiling and frowning.</p>



<p>“Facial muscles are less inhibited than other muscles during REM sleep,” Arnulf explains. Someone smiling in a dream may not make that expression in real life, but electrodes on the face can register tiny corresponding muscle twitches.</p>



<p>Out of 158 attempts to interrogate lucid dreamers, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221000592" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 total correct responses came from six different people</a>. Those six ranged from newbie to frequent lucid dreamers, including Mazurek, who heard scientists’ questions while dreaming he was in a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game. The rest of the attempts yielded five wrong answers, 28 ambiguous ones and 96 nonresponses.</p>



<p>When Konkoly first saw someone correctly answer a question in their sleep, “my first reaction was to not believe it.” But for 26 of those 29 correct responses, a panel of independent sleep experts unanimously agreed that the dreamers were in the throes of REM sleep when they replied. Nearly 400 attempts to reach sleepers who hadn’t signaled lucidity netted a single correct response — bolstering the researchers’ confidence that correct answers from lucid dreamers weren’t flukes. The results appeared in 2021 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>

<p>While dreaming, Christopher Mazurek signaled the outside world by sweeping his eyes left and right. Electrodes on his face recorded those motions. On the graph below, Mazurek’s eye motions that indicate he is lucid appear as three big up-down sweeps. Eye signals answering “2” to researchers’ simple math question appear as two big up-down sweeps.</p>

<p>“I was astonished,” says Robert Stickgold, a cognitive neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School who studies dreams but not lucid ones. “I had no question but that these people are in fact listening and are in fact having lucid dreams at the time of the communication — and that opens up all sorts of possibilities.”</p>



<p>Arnulf and others have since asked lucid dreamers to smile or frown as their dreams became more or less pleasant with the goal of understanding how dreamers experience emotion. Another study, not yet published, tracked when lucid dreamers answered or ignored researchers’ questions to see how people tuned in and out of the real world while dreaming. Knowing which signals break the dream-reality barrier could help “uncover the mechanism of the brain’s disconnection from the external world — which is huge,” Baird says. It could even be relevant for other states of unconsciousness, he adds, such as when someone is put under for surgery.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Limits of lucidity</h4>



<p>Even if researchers get all the expert lucid dreamers they need to run all their desired experiments, there’s still one major sticking point to this whole field of study.</p>



<p>“The biggest issue is how far can you push these results to dreaming in general,” Stickgold says. Imagine, for instance, that lucid dreamers get better at a skill by practicing it in their dreams. It’s not clear that people who just happen to have normal dreams about doing those activities, without self-awareness, would reap the same rewards. “It’s a little bit like recruiting major league baseball players to give you some baseline data on how far people can throw balls,” Stickgold says.</p>



<p>Existing data do suggest that lucid dreamers may have access to parts of the brain that normal dreamers don’t. The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/35/7/1017/2558845" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lone case study</a> comparing fMRIs of someone’s lucid and nonlucid REM sleep hints that brain areas linked with self-reflection and working memory are more active during lucidity. But those data come from just one person, and it’s not yet clear how such differences in brain activity would affect the outcomes of lucid dream experiments.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Brain clues to lucid dreams</h3>



<p>Functional MRI scans of one sleeper’s brain during lucid and nonlucid sleep showed that some brain areas (highlighted) may be more active during lucid dreams than during normal sleep. </p>



<ol>
<li>The lateral parietal cortex is involved in working memory. </li>



<li>The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar cortex are involved in working memory and introspection.</li>



<li>Activity near the temporal cortex may make lucid dreams brighter and more detailed than normal dreams.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some researchers, including Dresler, resist the idea that lucid dreams are profoundly different from nonlucid ones. “Lucid dreaming is not a strict all-or-nothing phenomenon,” he says, with people often fluttering in and out of awareness. “That suggests that lucid and nonlucid dreaming are in principle something very similar on the neural level and not two completely different animals.”</p>



<p>Perhaps lucidity affects some aspects of the dream experience but not all of them, Baird adds. In terms of how dreams look, he says, “it would be very, very surprising if it was somehow completely different when you become lucid.”</p>



<p>A more thorough inventory of the differences in brain activity between lucid and nonlucid dreams might help settle these questions. But even if lucid dreams don’t represent dreams in general, Nielsen still thinks they’re worth studying. “It is a type of consciousness that has intrigued and amused people for centuries,” he says. “It would be important for science to understand how and why humans have this extraordinary capacity for intentional world simulation.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-rsv-vaccine-pregnancy">The FDA added an RSV vaccine to the list of approved pregnancy shots. Here’s what to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Doctors across the United States will likely soon have two options to protect the youngest humans from RSV.</p>



<p>On August 22, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-pregnant-individuals-prevent-rsv-infants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first RSV vaccine for pregnant people</a>. By vaccinating individuals before they give birth — between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy — immune defenses sparked by the vaccine are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccines-antibodies-rsv-virus">transferred to newborns</a> for protection during their first months of life (<em>SN: 4/27/23</em>).</p>



<p>RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, causes respiratory tract disease and is the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/226/Supplement_2/S154/6666009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of hospitalization</a> in infants in the United States. Each year, the virus puts an estimated 58,000 to 80,000 kids younger than 5 in the hospital. The vaccine joins the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-prevent-rsv-babies-and-toddlers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antibody treatment</a> Beyfortus (nirsevimab), which was also recently approved by the FDA, as another preventive option for defending against the virus.</p>





<p>“It’s great that we have new tools to protect kids,” says pediatric infectious diseases physician and virologist Betsy Herold.</p>



<p>In a trial of approximately 7,000 pregnant people, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2216480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer babies born to individuals given the Pfizer-made vaccine</a> became severely ill, compared with babies whose parents received a placebo.</p>



<p>The results are promising. But it’s still unknown how the new vaccine and antibody drug might be used in health care clinics across the country, says Herold, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City.</p>



<p>While the FDA approves drugs and vaccines, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes recommendations about their use. On August 3, the CDC recommended that all infants younger than 8 months get a dose of Beyfortus, and infants ages 8 months to 19 months who are at high risk for severe RSV get a dose too.</p>



<p>The agency will soon weigh in on whether pregnant individuals should get the new vaccine, and possibly how it might be used in conjunction with the antibody drug.</p>



<p>Here are two things that advisors to the CDC will likely consider when deciding whether and how to weave the vaccine into the nation’s RSV toolbox.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A potential safety concern about the new RSV vaccine still lingers.</strong></h3>



<p>Data from Pfizer’s trial showed some hints that there may be a risk of premature birth — babies arriving before 37 weeks of pregnancy — in people who received the vaccine. The trial, however, didn’t include enough people to show that the vaccine was behind those early births.</p>



<p>In 2022, pharmaceutical company GSK halted a similar RSV clinical trial after a safety review detected a higher-than-expected rate of premature birth in people given their vaccine. So that risk was top of mind during an FDA <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXVMILYvocM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advisory committee meeting</a> in May that discussed the Pfizer shot’s efficacy and safety. But whether the vaccines themselves are behind the risk remains unclear.</p>



<p>The panel of experts unanimously agreed that the Pfizer vaccine effectively protected infants from RSV during their first six months of life. But the uncertainties about preterm birth risk divided some members on whether clinical trials showed that the vaccine was safe. Ten of 14 panelists voted that the vaccine’s ability to keep kids out of the hospital outweighed a small risk of premature birth.</p>





<p>The Pfizer and GSK vaccines are essentially identical, says pediatric infectious diseases specialist Paul Offit, a member of the FDA’s advisory committee and director of vaccine education at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “So, one of two things is true. Either one, they both have a problem, but Pfizer just hasn’t seen it yet. Or that two, neither of them has a problem.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s possible that the vaccine sparks inflammation that raises the risk of premature birth. But some data from GSK provide reassuring clues that vaccination itself isn’t raising the risk, Offit says.</p>



<p>When GSK researchers combed through the data, focusing in part on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P45AbqFeYBY&amp;t=28060s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who also received other vaccines during pregnancy</a>, they found that the risk of preterm birth was lower than expected in the control group. “The placebo itself doesn’t prevent prematurity,” Offit says. Instead, other vaccines may have provided people in the placebo group protection from other illnesses, such as flu or COVID, that can raise the risk that babies will be born early.</p>



<p>Larger studies could help reveal whether any link between the Pfizer vaccine and premature birth is real, Herold says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Relying only on an RSV vaccine for protection has limits.</strong></h3>



<p>Vaccinating pregnant individuals at 32 to 36 weeks before birth aims to transfer protective antibodies from parent to child mainly via the placenta. But that doesn’t necessarily work for infants born too early, who are already at a higher risk for severe RSV.</p>



<p>Premature babies would typically arrive before most of those protective antibodies could cross from parent to placenta to child, leaving the newborns without the full brunt of defensive benefits.</p>



<p>Because most of the births in Pfizer’s clinical trial were full-term, scientists don’t know whether the vaccine protects this vulnerable population, Herold says. This “doesn’t mean that [the vaccine] is not good, or that it doesn’t have potential advantages. But there are caveats.”</p>



<p>How long vaccine protection lasts is also unclear. Data show a reduced risk of severe RSV up to six months after birth. But protection falls off over time, Herold says.</p>



<p>That may in part be because many antibodies from mom transferred during pregnancy don’t stick around for a long time in babies. “Certainly, most of the hospitalizations are in the younger babies, but we also see [RSV] in 8-month-olds and 9-month-olds,” when protection from mom is dwindling. Antibodies passed from mom to babies during breastfeeding may also help ensure infants have a steady supply of protection, Offit says.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>The new drug Beyfortus, an engineered antibody that is given as a shot, will be available this fall, according to the CDC. It could especially help protect babies born prematurely and those older babies that are at higher risk. But there are questions about when to use the drug over the vaccine or vice versa, Herold says. Or “is there any rationale for using both? Is that overkill?”</p>



<p>Based on how the antibodies interact with the virus, each approach has its benefits. Beyfortus antibodies are engineered to attach to a specific spot on the virus and activate the immune system for protection. Those antibodies stick around in babies’ bodies longer than the antibodies from vaccination that are transferred during pregnancy.</p>



<p>But the antibodies made in response to the vaccine glom onto many spots on the virus, Offit says. Such varied points of attack from those antibodies would be helpful if the virus acquires mutations that make it so Beyfortus no longer recognizes it. That would be much like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-testing-treatment">coronavirus did</a> during the pandemic, rendering antibody treatments to prevent severe COVID-19 ineffective (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>While variants are always something to worry about, Offit says, RSV doesn&#8217;t seem to mutate as quickly as the coronavirus does. Another lab-made antibody has been available since 1998 for high-risk infants without losing effectiveness against RSV variants capable of dodging the immune system. And earlier this year, the FDA approved an RSV vaccine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-approved-first-vaccine-rsv">for people older than 60</a>, an age group at high risk for severe RSV (<em>SN: 5/3/23</em>). Antibodies from vaccinated people <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adg6050?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still recognized a wide variety of RSV variants</a>, researchers report August 23 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>For now, Herold says, there are many unanswered questions. But the CDC&#8217;s recommendations are probably coming soon — though the timing hasn&#8217;t been announced — and could provide some clarity.  </p>

<p>An article published last January in a physics journal attracted attention for its conclusion that–contrary to mainstream climate science–extreme weather events have not become more intense or more frequent as the temperature of the earth’s surface has increased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the journal’s editors have retracted the article after a post-publication review found “that the conclusions of the article were not supported by available evidence or data provided by the authors.”</p>



<p>In the abstract of “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-02243-9">A critical assessment of extreme events trends in times of global warming</a>,” published in <em>The European Physical Journal Plus</em>, the authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127761"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On the basis of observational data, the climate crisis that, according to many sources, we are experiencing today, is not evident yet.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That conclusion found favor on <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/121693729">social media</a>, as well as in <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/is-climate-change-driving-extreme-weather/"><em>The National Review,</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/science/climate-crisis-not-evident-yet-says-new-study-4737922"><em>The Epoch Times</em></a>, and other outlets, but articles in <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/sky-australian-no-evidence-climate-000042632.html"><em>The Guardian</em></a><em> </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32K66UE-1"><em>AFP</em></a><em> </em>quoted climate scientists who said the authors had “cherry-picked” the data they analyzed and the paper <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-09-scientists-urge-publisher-faulty-climate.html">should be retracted</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after the critical coverage was published, on Sept. 30, 2022, the journal added the following editor’s note to the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Readers are alerted that the conclusions reported in this manuscript are currently under dispute. The journal is investigating the issue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nearly a year later, on August 23, as <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/top-science-publisher-withdraws-flawed-115435891.html"><em>AFP</em> first reported</a>, the journal pulled the paper. According to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/s13360-023-04386-3">retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. Concerns were raised regarding the selection of the data, the analysis and the resulting conclusions of the article. The authors were invited to submit an addendum to the article, but post publication review of the concerns with the article and the submitted addendum concluded that the addendum was not suitable for publication and that the conclusions of the article were not supported by available evidence or data provided by the authors. In light of these concerns and based on the outcome of the post publication review, the Editors-in-Chief no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions reported in this article.</p>



<p>The authors disagree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first and corresponding author of the paper, <a href="https://www0.mi.infn.it/~alimonti/homepage/indexEn.htm">Gianluca Alimonti</a> of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare and Università degli Studi in Milan, Italy, has not yet responded to our request for comment. [See update at end of post.]</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Springer Nature, the publisher of the journal where the paper appeared, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors-in-Chief of the <em>European Physical Journal Plus</em> have retracted this article. When they became aware of concerns, the Editors — with advice and assistance provided by Springer Nature Research Integrity Group — launched a thorough investigation following an established process in line with best-practice Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines. This process included a post-publication review by subject-matter experts of the article and an addendum submitted by the authors during the investigation.</p>



<p>After careful consideration and consultation with all parties involved, the Editors and publishers concluded that they no longer had confidence in the results and conclusions of the article. The addendum was not considered suitable for publication, and retraction was the most appropriate course of action in order to maintain the validity of the scientific record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper has been cited 23 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/apology-indigenous-communities-mental-health-rethink">An apology to Indigenous communities sparks a mental health rethink</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earlier this year, the leading psychological association in the United States apologized to the country’s Indigenous people and communities for directly and indirectly supporting centuries of abusive assimilation efforts. Those efforts included pushing Indigenous people off their lands and separating children from their families for placement in boarding schools.</p>



<p>The harms of these practices to Indigenous communities <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/indigenous-apology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are ongoing</a>, the American Psychological Association acknowledged in a report released in February. For instance, culturally inappropriate mental health diagnoses and treatments have exacerbated Indigenous communities’ already disproportionately high rates of mental illness, chronic disease, incarceration and suicide.</p>





<p>By the numbers, American Indian and Alaska Natives report serious psychological distress 2.5 times as often as members of the general population. They are almost five times as likely to die of alcohol poisoning than the general population. And they have the highest rate of suicide of any minority group in the country.</p>



<p>The APA also pledged its commitment to learning about and valuing culturally appropriate approaches to care moving forward. “Psychologists working with Native clients should respect, honor, and include Native strategies for healing,” reads one bullet point. “Psychologists need to learn about research methodologies developed by and for Indigenous populations,” reads another. APA leaders also issued in-person apologies at the June annual meeting of the Society of Indian Psychologists in Logan, Utah, and again in August at the APA Convention in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>This apology honors the longstanding, often underappreciated, efforts of Indigenous and other researchers working with Indigenous communities. In recent years, Canada and Australia have issued similar apologies to their countries’ Indigenous populations. Such apologies pave the way for the sort of deep changes in thinking and treatment that are needed to help Indigenous communities heal, researchers involved in this work say.</p>



<p>These researchers anchor healing in Indigenous world views that prioritize harmony between people and the planet. And they recognize the powerful role history plays in shaping health and well-being. Indigenous psychology is about “looking at the whole person — the mental, the physical, the spiritual, the emotional — within the context of colonization,” says Suzanne Stewart, a psychologist at the University of Toronto and member of the Yellowknife Dene First Nation in Canada.</p>



<p>Specifically, many Indigenous-centered treatments incorporate traditional practices, such as making crafts from local materials, collecting medicinal herbs and engaging in rituals. Underlying such programs is the idea that if the historical trauma of colonization is the problem, then cultural revitalization could be the solution.</p>



<p>This culture-as-treatment approach represents a marked departure from Western approaches to care, which often minimize historic and cultural context. Assessing the success of those methods is also difficult using measurements typical in Western medicine. So researchers working in Indigenous psychology are measuring the effectiveness of those programs through qualitative, culturally appropriate methods, such as detailed first-person accounts.</p>



<p>Apologies like the one from APA mark an important step forward, says psychologist Karlee Fellner of the University of Calgary in Canada, and a citizen of the Métis Nation of Alberta. But Feller wonders, can the scientific establishment accept such a radical departure from care and research as usual? “That’s the question mark.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Using culture as treatment</h4>



<p>Indigenous understandings of well-being have evolved over tens of thousands of years. These populations are not a monolith; they speak many languages and engage in myriad cultural practices.</p>



<p>But a golden thread running through their belief systems is the idea that well-being stems from a healthy relationship between people and their environs, says Patricia Dudgeon, a psychologist and researcher at the University of Western Australia in Perth, and a descendant of the Bardi people from the Kimberley. Those relationships include both human and nonhuman relationships, such as relationships with one’s ancestors, other animals and the land.</p>





<p>In the United States, the idea of restoring this golden thread, or returning to culture to facilitate healing, gained momentum during the Red Power Movement from roughly 1969 to 1979. Activists sought greater autonomy for Tribal nations to protect against further assimilation with white culture. They viewed such assimilation as a form of cultural erasure.</p>



<p>The idea of culture as treatment became so popular that people working in Indigenous communities assumed that the approach worked, says Harvard University psychologist Joseph P. Gone, a member of the <em>Aaniiih</em>-Gros Ventre tribal nation located in Montana. But the theory had gotten ahead of the science. Gone and others began to explore the idea more systematically. Those efforts have included formally defining what is meant by Indigenous psychologies, developing programs that adhere to those world views and identifying culturally appropriate ways to measure how well they work.&nbsp;</p>

Psychologists hope that using culture as part of treatment can help Indigenous communities heal from colonial trauma.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130466">Stephanie Tipple</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Dudgeon and coauthors recently outlined a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-023-00176-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of Indigenous flourishing</a> they developed in conjunction with Aboriginal community members<em>. </em>That work, published in March in <em>Nature Reviews Psychology</em>, suggests that well-being for Indigenous people in Australia includes seven domains, all influenced by social, cultural and historical forces, as well as individual experiences and personality. Those domains include mind and emotion, body, family, community, culture, country and spirituality. “That [definition] looks at the whole of the person,” Dudgeon says.</p>



<p>That holistic view, in turn, shapes how researchers think about improving Indigenous people’s well-being. “Just looking at differences in world views, I think that Western healing is about empowering the individual to have control over their environment and so on. That is not really in keeping with Indigenous world views, where it’s about relationships,” says mental health clinician and researcher Rod McCormick of Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, Canada. McCormick is a citizen of the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) Nation.</p>



<p>For instance, over a decade ago, Gone partnered with the Blackfeet Nation in Montana to develop a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25961644/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summer cultural immersion program</a> for people struggling with addiction. In 2012, Gone helped launch a 12-day pilot program for four participants, described in the 2015 <em>Psychological Services</em>. During camp, participants engaged in sweat lodge and pipe ceremonies, pitched tipis, procured and prepared food, harvested sacred plants and tanned hides.</p>



<p>The rationale behind using culture as treatment is multifaceted, Gone writes. Among them, this approach can restore Indigenous people’s connection to the places and practices — a source of purpose and meaning — that colonization eroded. It has the potential to provide people with a sense of spirituality that is incompatible with substance use. And it can help participants develop new social networks. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Participating in cultural activities helps participants use their cultural past to chart a new path forward and achieve a greater sense of purpose, Gone writes. “By virtue of their participation in camp activities … they were engaged in crafting functional contemporary identities and modes of living that were continuous with — rather than alienated from — that past.”</p>



<p>Other researchers have modified the concept of Western talk therapy for an Indigenous clientele. Indigenous Focusing Oriented Therapy starts with the idea that trauma in Indigenous communities is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00110000221146571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intergenerational and shaped by colonization</a>, researchers report in the April <em>The Counseling Psychologist.</em> During a typical IFOT session, a therapist and client sit facing the land in front of them rather than across from each other to acknowledge the vital link between place and well-being. Moreover, rather than talk about their trauma, as in the Western therapy model, clients are encouraged to foster their “felt sense” — essentially using the body’s emotions, energies and sensations to express knowledge of how one is part of a larger web of human and nonhuman relationships.</p>



<p>“IFOT is applying a Western therapeutic tool,” says Fellner who is trained in the method. “But what really makes it different is that you are coming from Indigenous ways of understanding.”</p>



<p>In a presentation at last month’s Society of Indian Psychologists’ meeting, Fellner and her team described how they took the IFOT model <a href="https://sipconvention.org/Agenda.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of the office and onto the land</a>. The team held a 24-day pilot program at the base of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. Six participants attended a combination of IFOT therapy sessions and land-based activities, such as making spirit dolls and medicines from local herbs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081823_sg_indigenous-psychology_inline2-600x450.jpg" alt="A photo of participants in a land-based healing program in rural Alberta, Canada engaging in a morning prayer meditation.

Here, participants in a land-based healing program in rural Alberta, Canada engage in a morning prayer meditation.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130468">Karlee Fellner</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Taking IFOT to the land has proven a powerful approach, says Fellner, who continues to lead this work with communities. She recounts a healing circle she ran earlier this year. Several elders joined the group one day and shared traumatic stories of their pasts, such as experiencing the death of their adult children. “All of a sudden when we were done sharing, this wicked hailstorm came in and flooded the tipi. We ran into the nearest building when we had the opportunity. We were all drying off. The elders were all laughing,” Fellner recalls. “The land came and helped us.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Questioning the gold standard</h4>



<p>Rigorous trials of these sorts of cultural treatment programs remain rare. Reasons why include difficulties in securing funding, low participation rates and questions around the cultural appropriateness of using Western methodology to measure Indigenous psychology.</p>



<p>Gone, for instance, could not experimentally test the effectiveness of the Blackfeet cultural immersion program or another program he helped launch later in Detroit. “In neither instance did we proceed to get the kind of funding that would allow [us] to evaluate them,” he says. Gone attributes part of that funding difficulty to the conservatism of scientific health agencies that prioritize incremental changes to existing programs over wholly new approaches.</p>



<p>Researchers who do manage to run randomized controlled trials, the purported gold standard of scientific measurement, often find that <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-080921-072950" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural treatments don’t work</a> as planned, Gone noted in May 2023 in the <em>Annual Review of Clinical Psychology.</em></p>



<p>“Most of them found that culture didn’t matter or that in some cases, it led to potentially worse outcomes,” Gone says. But the results are “not big enough to really have confidence in the findings. So they’re suggesting that culture doesn’t matter or that in fact it’s harmful but without the proper controls to really have confidence in the findings. That’s bad.”</p>



<p>Recruiting Indigenous participants to such studies is incredibly challenging, McCormick says. “People don’t want to participate in experimental research much. We have got a bad history with research. Research has been done on us.”</p>



<p>Even when researchers manage to recruit enough participants, many drop out. For instance, in one of the six recent randomized trials Gone reviewed, only 30 percent of participants completed nine or more of the 13 therapy sessions.</p>



<p>The problems with clinical trials, though, are both logistic and cultural. Western psychology rests on certain norms, such as the belief that behavior can be broken down into discrete units and that individualize prioritize self-reliance and autonomy, the authors of the APA report note. “The assumptions made by American psychology &nbsp;are contradictory and reductionist compared to the complex, holistic and inter-relational view of health that has been integral to Indigenous people for thousands of years.”</p>



<p>That reductionist approach allows researchers to deliver the same treatment to one group and compare their outcomes to another group not receiving the treatment. But that way of thinking runs counter to Indigenous understandings of sickness and health.</p>



<p>The established diagnostic and treatment process, for instance, does not account for the historic and ongoing traumas associated with colonization, Stewart says. “Western psychology doesn’t really give reasons or causes of mental health disorders because the Western biomedical model is about remediating symptoms. You remediate the symptom, the disorder goes away.” Cultural revitalization practices, by contrast, are localized to given communities.</p>



<p>And diagnostic labels can amplify historic wrongs. “Diagnoses have energy, they have spirit, they manifest. To diagnose somebody from an Indigenous perspective in that way, we can cause harm,” Fellner says. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The value of firsthand experience</h4>



<p>It can be very difficult to quantify the results of Indigenous healing practices by Western scientific calculations. Instead, Indigenous methodologies bear closer resemblance to qualitative research than quantitative research. They also prioritize community involvement in developing treatments and place participant voices at the center of the data collection process.</p>



<p>“Any kind of book learning or rarified abstracted knowledge from afar is considered almost irrelevant,” Gone says. “There’s nothing better than firsthand experience.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="364" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081823_sg_indigenous-psychology_inline3.jpg" alt="A photo of Indigenous youth putting up a tipi as part of a hunting camp." class="wp-image-3130469" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081823_sg_indigenous-psychology_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/081823_sg_indigenous-psychology_inline3-330x177.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3130469">As part of a hunting camp in Alberta, Canada, Indigenous youth put up a tipi.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3130469">Karlee Fellner</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That idea shows up in the National Empowerment Project in Australia. Since 2012, Dudgeon and colleagues have been working with Aboriginal communities across Australia to reduce mental distress. The team partners with Aboriginal organizations in a given community to identify individuals to train as community researchers. Those researchers then must complete certain deliverables, such as interviewing community members about issues related to well-being, analyzing those findings with the help of other project members and writing detailed reports about their findings.</p>



<p>Besides illuminating the key needs of each community, such as desire for a youth center or family programming, the process helps turn <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1609406917699515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community researchers into community leaders</a>, Dudgeon and colleagues reported in the 2017 <em>International Journal of Qualitative Methods.</em></p>



<p>This approach empowers communities to take charge of their own healing, Dudgeon says. “We don’t go in like big researchers.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other methodologies rely on Indigenous communities’ long tradition of oral storytelling. For instance, in a practice called yarning, a researcher simply asks participants to tell their story. Rather than asking predetermined questions, the researcher has a topic guide that tells them what to listen for in the story, researchers write in December 2022 in the <em>International Journal for Equity in Health.</em></p>



<p>The authors of that <a href="https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-022-01738-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review of 46 yarning studies</a> sought to understand how researchers have been using the method in health-related studies. They also investigated the role, if any, that Indigenous researchers played in the process.</p>



<p>More rigor is needed in research that uses the approach, the authors found. But that rigor bears little resemblance to Western methods. For instance, the authors noted that many of the researchers conducting interviews failed to disclose their own lived experience, such as ethnic background or connection to a given land. But acknowledging that context is integral to the yarning process, as it shapes the power dynamics between interviewer and interviewee.</p>



<p>When it comes to evaluating such programs, even participant enthusiasm provides some proof of success, researchers say. For instance, the Blackfeet summer cultural immersion program Gone helped develop continued well after funding for the program ended. That indicated that the most important players, the clients, found healing in the culture-as-treatment approach, Gone notes.</p>



<p>Fellner reports a similar experience. “We don’t need a randomized controlled trial to know that Indigenous Focusing Oriented Therapy works,” she says. “This is working so much that the IFOT folks have not had time to publish.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>But with most psychology training grounded in Western thinking and methodology, can establishment psychologists accept methods that deviate so far from the status quo? Only time will tell, Fellner says. “With all these apologies, with all these action items, my hope is that that they will show us that they really mean it by acknowledging and honoring Indigenous systems of evidence.”</p>

<p>A study by two economists who found opening strip clubs or escort services caused sex crimes in the neighborhood to drop contains &#8220;fatal errors&#8221; and should be retracted, argues a group of past and current law enforcement officers, including three academics.</p>



<p>&#8220;None of us are prudes or even anti-strip club,&#8221; <a href="https://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/peter-moskos">Peter Moskos</a>, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City and a former Baltimore police officer, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMoskos/status/1692030498665562513">wrote in a thread</a> on X (formerly Twitter). &#8220;But if you claim strip clubs reduce sex crimes – and by 13 percent! – you&#8217;re delving into serious policy issues.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;This is very typical of academics getting out of their field. They have second-hand data. They crunch the numbers … They don&#8217;t know what the data mean.&#8221;</p>



<span id="more-127754"></span>



<p>The study, titled &#8220;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/132/641/147/6309337?redirectedFrom=fulltext">The Effect of Adult Entertainment Establishments on Sex Crime: Evidence from New York City</a>,&#8221; was published in July 2021 in <em>The Economic Journal</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We find that these businesses decrease sex crime by 13% per police precinct one week after the opening, and have no effect on other types of crime,&#8221; wrote <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/riccardociacci/home">Riccardo Ciacci</a>, of Universidad Pontificia Comillas, in Spain, and <a href="http://www.micaelasviatschi.com/">Maria Micaela Sviatschi</a>, of Princeton University, in their abstract.</p>



<p>What the data suggest, the duo speculated in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/07/06/sex-crimes-adult-entertainment-research/">an opinion piece</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em>, is that &#8220;Men otherwise inclined to commit assaults might instead spend more time in strip clubs or hiring escorts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Predictably, the findings drew a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strip-clubs-decline-sex-crimes-b1882759.html">bit</a> of <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90655307/princeton-university-study-strip-clubs-and-escort-services-may-help-reduce-sex-crimes">media</a> <a href="https://studyfinds.org/escort-services-strip-clubs-help-reduce-sex-crimes/">attention</a>. But in the view of Moskos and his colleagues – two former police officers turned academics and the commander of the crime-strategies unit in the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority Police Department – they should never have passed peer review.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As the four told the journal in an August 2021 email seen by Retraction Watch, after corresponding with the study authors, &#8220;ultimately we could not reconcile the study’s conclusions with the distinct limitations of its data.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the email, they pointed to three major concerns:</p>



<ul>
<li>The study relied on the date a business was registered with the state as a proxy for when it opened. But for strip clubs, licensing and inspections can lead to delays of months between registration and opening.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The study used <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page">NYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk</a> data as a proxy for sex crimes. These data have been <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data">heavily criticized</a>; Moskos and his colleagues claim that more than 94% &#8220;are records of people who were legally innocent of a crime at the time and place of the encounter.&#8221;&nbsp;</li>



<li>The study&#8217;s baseline data on strip clubs missed a number of establishments Moskos and his colleagues knew to exist. (They name-check several, including Wild Wild West, Corrado’s and Sweet Cherry.)</li>
</ul>



<p>In a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4528229">preprint</a> posted to SSRN this month and submitted for review to <em>Police Practice and Research</em>, they boiled it all down to this:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What the study has done is measure changes in police encounters with innocent people in the week after an entity has filed the paperwork necessary to start the processes that will eventually allow it to open a strip club.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But <em>The Economic Journal</em> apparently failed to get the point. In an email seen by Retraction Watch, Editor-in-Chief Francesco Lippi replied to the group:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal is open to considering comments on published papers. In the case of empirical papers, comments are expected to be based on systematic analyses of the data, highlighting differences between the results obtained in the original paper and in the new analysis.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;We said the data shouldn&#8217;t have been used in the first place, and their response was to suggest we re-analyze the data and point out differences,&#8221; <a href="https://brandondelpozo.com/">Brandon del Pozo</a>, the corresponding author on the preprint and an assistant professor at Brown University, told Retraction Watch. (Del Pozo is also a former police officer.)</p>



<p>Reached for comment, Lippi did not directly address the issue of the data being unfit to address the study’s hypothesis, but said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This criticism was based on a data analysis that used a small subsample of observations for which the authors were able to gather more precise measurements.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that he had not heard back after sending the email welcoming a re-analysis of the data. “As far as I am concerned, a serious (scientifically sound) confutation of the original thesis has not been given yet,” Lippi told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Del Pozo said that after failing to move forward with Lippi, he and his colleagues sent their concerns to the <em>Journal of Comments and Replications in Economics</em>. But the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>declined to publish them based on a response from the authors that we frankly found a little bewildering. They used an irrelevant case of a person buying an existing business from someone else to say we didn&#8217;t prove strip clubs don&#8217;t open on the day they are registered with the state. Then they said their robustness check, which used data that principally derives from the main dataset, showed similar results at the precinct-month level, so their results were good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ciacci told Retraction Watch in a brief email that the preprint contained &#8220;plenty of imprecise information about&#8221; his and Sviatschi&#8217;s paper:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is why at least two journals, to the best of my knowledge, decided not to publish that article. Indeed, we were contacted by JCRE (Journal of Comments and Replications in Economics) to reply to their paper. After reading our reply the Editors of JCRE opted to reject their article. Likewise, the Economic Journal decided to reject their article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ciacci, who said he was on vacation, did not reply to a follow-up email asking for specific comments on the arguments in the preprint. Sviatschi declined to comment, noting that she was “on maternity leave with my baby and no help.” [See update at end of post.]</p>



<p>“And so it is,” Moskos wrote in his <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMoskos/status/1692030506894774745">punchy prose</a> on X.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-thermal-night-vision">How artificial intelligence sharpens blurry thermal vision images</a></h4>

              
                <p>The fuzzy, ghostly figures typically seen in thermal images might become a thing of the past. By pairing artificial intelligence and thermal vision, scientists can make crisp, detailed images — even in the dark. The technique could one day help improve self-driving vehicles&#8217; ability to navigate at night.<br><br>Thermal imaging, which is often used in night vision systems, works by detecting heat sources. The infrared images are blurry because of a phenomenon called ghosting. Heat from an object overwhelms any details about the object’s texture, much like turning on a light makes it difficult to decipher any etching on a lightbulb.</p>



<p>Theoretical physicist Fanglin Bao of Purdue University in West Lafeyette, Ind., and colleagues used a thermal camera that can distinguish between different wavelengths of infrared light. The researchers paired that camera with a computer program that uses AI to untangle information from the device to reveal the temperature, texture and type of material of objects in an image. This technique <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06174-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">painted bright, detailed images out of dark, nighttime scenes</a>, the team reports July 26 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>“There is no restriction of harsh weather conditions or nighttime scenarios,” says electrical engineer Muhammad Ali Farooq of the University of Galway in Ireland, who was not involved with the study. “You can get very good and very crisp data even in low-lighting conditions.”</p>



<p>The technique can also measure distance with about the same accuracy as current camera-based methods. This means it could be used in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/self-driving-cars-see-better-cameras-mimic-mantis-shrimp-vision">self-driving vehicles</a>, which have to know when to brake to avoid causing a wreck (<em>SN: 10/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>Current self-driving vehicles often gauge distance by bouncing signals off objects, similar to how sonar works. Many autonomous cars sending out signals could confuse one another. Because the new technique doesn’t need to send out a signal, it could be safer to scale up in a world with more self-driving cars, the researchers say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, the technology won’t be cruising through busy streets any time soon. The camera is hefty, about half a meter on each side and expensive — it costs upward of $1 million, Bao says. And capturing each image takes about a second, which is too slow for a self-driving vehicle that needs to respond to situations in real time.</p>



<p>Still, Bao looks forward to seeing versions of this technology might do for self-driving vehicles or robots in the future. “We humans have an evolutionary bias towards the light,” he says. “But it turns out AI can overcome this long-standing dichotomy between day and night.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-emperor-penguins-endangered-climate">Emperor penguins lost thousands of chicks to melting ice last year</a></h4>

              
                <p>Thousands of emperor penguins in western Antarctica lost their chicks last year, largely due to receding sea ice, satellite data suggest.</p>



<p>Over the last two years, sea ice has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-sea-ice-record-low-2023">reached record lows</a> around much of Antarctica (<em>SN: 7/5/23</em>). But while looking at satellite images in 2022, geographer Peter Fretwell noticed that ice in one area was melting especially early in the year. He and his colleagues wanted to measure the impact of this ice loss — in the Bellingshausen Sea off western Antarctica — on emperor penguins (<em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em>) in the region.</p>





<p>So the researchers looked at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emperor-penguin-poop-satellite-images-space-new-colonies">satellite images</a> of colonies to determine the fate of the breeding season (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>). Of the five colonies observed, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00927-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four probably lost all their chicks</a>, the team reports August 23 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>Emperor penguins rely on stable sea ice throughout their breeding season, which lasts from April to January. When an egg hatches, the newborn chick must fledge, losing its downy feathers to gain its waterproof coat.</p>



<p>In 2022, sea ice broke up before some colonies were finished fledging. Without waterproof feathers, fledging birds were unable to survive, Fretwell says. Of the youngsters from the 10,000 or so breeding pairs in the region, “we think about 850 of the chicks survived,” says Fretwell, of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, England.</p>

<p>Penguin colonies can recover from a single failed breeding season, says Annie Schmidt, a seabird ecologist at Blue Point Conservation Science in Petaluma, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the new study. And the researchers looked at only a few emperor penguin colonies of the 62 throughout Antarctica.</p>



<p>Some of those other colonies have also experienced bad breeding seasons lately. On Antarctica’s Brunt Ice Shelf, the world’s second-largest emperor penguin colony at the time had <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/emperors-on-thin-ice-three-years-of-breeding-failure-at-halley-bay/4CA1A77971A4CD5D5CB823EBF338FAA9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three years of breeding failure</a> from 2016 to 2018 after storms broke up sea ice there, Fretwell and a colleague previously reported. Between breeding failure and mass emigration to another site, the colony all but disappeared.</p>



<p>Repeated, or more widespread, failure could threaten colonies and, eventually, emperor penguins as a whole.</p>



<p>The new study, documenting breeding failure across several colonies at once, “is the first observation that&#8217;s in line with the worst expectations of what could happen” as the Earth continues to warm, Schmidt says. “I’m concerned — it’s not a good sign.” Recent estimates predict that the changing climate and melting sea ice <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719309899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could cut emperor penguin populations by more than half</a> by 2100.</p>



<p>Despite that potentially grim outlook for emperor penguins, Fretwell still has hope. “If we can slow down global warming … we can turn around the fate of the emperor penguin,” he says. “But that window of opportunity is getting smaller, so we really have to act now.”</p>
