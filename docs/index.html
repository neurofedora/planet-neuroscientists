              <h4><a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2023/04/27/if-we-dont-ask/">If we don’t ask….</a></h4>

              
                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/iStock-869270600-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Pregnancy, childbirth and caring for an infant can be stressful. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61276-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One in five women</a> experience mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression, during their pregnancy or after giving birth. This can have very serious consequences for women, their infants and their families. It is critical that we identify women who are struggling with their mental health so that we can offer help and support.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg192/chapter/Recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidelines</a> set out by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England recommend that all women should be asked about their mental health when they attend their first appointment in pregnancy and again soon after they give birth. In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05518-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our new paper</a>, we used responses to three national maternity surveys in England to find out whether women are being asked in accordance with the guidelines.</p>
<p>Over 13,000 women who gave birth between 2014 and 2020 took part in our <a href="https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/maternity-surveys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveys</a>. Across the three surveys, we found that between 17% and 20% of these women were not asked about their mental health during pregnancy and between 12% and 26% were not asked after they gave birth. We also found that women from ethnic minority backgrounds were less likely to be asked about their mental health, when compared to white women. This is important because if certain groups of women are less likely to be asked, then these same groups of women are less likely to be identified as needing support and less likely to receive treatment.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we don’t ask, then we risk missing vulnerable women who can be helped.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why are some women not asked about their mental health? Studies have shown that there are <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02646838.2016.1188278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barriers</a> for healthcare professionals when it comes to talking to women about mental health. These include time constraints during maternity appointments, lack of training and confidence to talk to women about their mental health, not knowing how to support women with symptoms or how to get help for women who need further input. There may be <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/evaluation-of-ethnic-disparities-in-detection-of-depression-and-anxiety-in-primary-care-during-the-maternal-period-combined-analysis-of-routine-and-cohort-data/98B959EF09DDEBED21FCE66489C23C56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional barriers</a> for healthcare professionals when it comes to talking about mental health with women from ethnic minority backgrounds. These include difficulties with language and communication and concerns over how cultural beliefs might affect perceptions and conversations about mental health.</p>
<p>And why is it so important? If we don’t ask, then we don’t know how many women are suffering from mental health problems around the time of pregnancy or who these women are. We therefore don’t know the scope of the problem, how the problem affects different groups of women, or whether we have adequate services and resources to meet the needs of all women needing support. We know that <a href="https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/assets/downloads/mbrrace-uk/reports/maternal-report-2022/MBRRACE-UK_Maternal_MAIN_Report_2022_v10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maternal suicide</a> remains the leading direct cause of death over the first year following pregnancy. This is a startling reminder of the importance of recognizing women who need help, and this may start with a simple question. If we don’t ask, then we risk missing vulnerable women who can be helped.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pets-owners-bond-pandemic-stress">Pets and people bonded during the pandemic. But owners were still stressed and lonely</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you feel like you bonded with your pet during the pandemic, you’re not alone.</p>



<p>Cat and dog owners in the United States <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gradually grew closer to their pets during the first two years of COVID-19</a>. But these furry friends didn’t ease their humans’ overall stress or loneliness, despite owners citing their pets’ positive influences, researchers report April 26 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>“The one very clear message is that the human-animal relationship is very complicated,” says veterinary epidemiologist Hsin-Yi Weng of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>





<p>When the coronavirus outbreak began, Weng and colleagues recognized it as an unfortunate but unique opportunity to explore the dynamics of pet ownership during a large-scale, disruptive event. The team launched a survey around mid-2020 asking about people’s stress, loneliness and relationships with their pets. Participants reflected on their emotions before the pandemic (February 2020) and during lockdown (April to June 2020). Follow-up surveys in September 2020 and quarterly throughout 2021 captured information about the reopening and recovery phases, respectively.</p>



<p>Analyzing responses from more than 4,200 individuals, the team found that cat and dog owners felt they steadily bonded with their pets between the pre-pandemic and recovery phases. Spending more time at home and isolated from other people might explain those strengthened relationships, the researchers say.</p>



<p>But pets’ effects on mental health were a little fuzzier. Although the authors expected pets to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/six-ways-beat-chronic-stress">buffer stress</a> and loneliness, people with fluffy companions had similar loneliness levels — and sometimes even higher stress levels — compared with non–pet owners (<em>SN: 2/20/15</em>). The results did suggest though that having a pet buffered the loneliness related to romantic relationships, or lack thereof.</p>



<p>On average, people without pets reported the lowest amounts of stress while cat owners had the highest. Affording veterinary and everyday care, especially during lockdown, may have contributed to pet owners’ stress, the team suggests.</p>



<p>“There are two sides of having a pet,” Weng says. While they provide companionship, pets also add extra responsibilities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rosalind-franklin-dna-structure-watson-crick">What was Rosalind Franklin’s true role in the discovery of DNA’s double helix?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rosalind Franklin’s role in the discovery of the structure of DNA may have been different than previously believed. Franklin wasn’t the victim of data theft at the hands of James Watson and Francis Crick, say biographers of the famous duo. Instead, she collaborated and shared data with Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins.</p>



<p>Seventy years ago, a trio of scientific papers announcing the discovery of DNA’s double helix was published. Watson, Crick and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1962 for the finding. Franklin, a chemist and X-ray crystallographer, died of ovarian cancer before the prize was awarded and was not eligible to be included.</p>





<p>Many people have been outraged by accounts that Watson and Crick used Franklin’s unpublished data without her knowledge or consent in making their model of DNA’s molecular structure. What’s more, Franklin supposedly did not understand the significance of an X-ray diffraction image, taken by her graduate student, that came to be known as Photograph 51. Wilkins showed the image to Watson, who is said to have instantly recognized it as proof that DNA forms a double helix. And the rest is history.</p>



<p>Except that history is wrong, say Watson and Crick biographers Nathaniel Comfort and Matthew Cobb. Cobb is a zoologist at the University of Manchester in England, and Comfort, of Johns Hopkins University, is a historian of science and medicine. They uncovered historical documents among Franklin’s papers that they say should change the view of her contribution to the discovery.</p>



<p>Among the documents was an unpublished article from <em>Time</em> magazine depicting Watson and Crick as a team collaborating with Franklin and Wilkins, who were working as a pair. Overlooked letters and a program from a presentation to the United Kingdom’s Royal Society reinforced the idea that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01313-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franklin was a willing colleague who understood her data</a>. The researchers laid out their findings in a commentary in the April 27 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Cobb and Comfort talked with <em>Science News</em> about their new view of Franklin’s contributions. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Why did you decide to go through these documents?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> Matthew&#8217;s writing this biography of Crick, and I am writing a biography of Watson&#8230;. And we decided as a kind of pilgrimage to go and see the Franklin papers in person….</p>



<p>We weren&#8217;t expecting really anything other than just sort of a perfunctory visit when we sat down in this archive room together, and they pulled out the folders. We started going over them together, bouncing ideas back and forth saying, “Hey, what&#8217;s this?”</p>





<p>The sparks started flying, and that was when we found this magazine article from <em>Time</em> that was never published. It was a very rough draft that the author, named Joan Bruce, had sent to Franklin for fact-checking to make sure she got the science right.</p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> So what Nathaniel immediately picked up on in the Bruce article was the way that she presented the discovery. She presents it as being an equal piece of work — that the two groups, at King’s [College with Franklin and Wilkins] and at the Cavendish [Laboratory with Watson and Crick] in Cambridge, are effectively collaborating….</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not [the story] we&#8217;re used to hearing because the version we have is the dramatic Jim Watson version from his book <em>The Double Helix:</em> “Ha-ha! I stole their data!… Little did they know but I had it in my hands.” This is dramatic reconstruction.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> If it were this way [as in Bruce’s article], it actually gives the lie to Watson&#8217;s sensational account. And we know why — or at least I think I know why — Watson gave that sensational account.</p>



<p>The audience for <em>The Double Helix</em> was intended to be high school and college students who he wanted to get excited about science.… And I have lots of examples from that book where he stretches the truth, where he takes liberties, where he takes literary license. And I can show that as a pattern through the entire book. So it also fits with the style and tone of <em>The Double Helix</em>.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> <strong>Is there other evidence that Watson and Crick didn’t steal her data?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> &nbsp;What we have separately done by looking in real detail at the records — the interviews that Crick did in the ’60s and so on — is we’ve been able to reconstruct the process that [Watson and Crick] went through. Which, if you read their papers really carefully, actually says quite explicitly that they engaged in what they called a process of trial and error. So they knew roughly the size of the crystal of the DNA molecule. They knew the atoms that should be in there from the density. So they tried to fit this stuff into this size using chemical rules.</p>



<p>Then there’s this report [on X-ray diffraction data] that was written by the King’s researchers, Franklin and Wilkins, as part of their funding from the Medical Research Council. It was shared with other laboratories, including the head of the laboratory in Cambridge, Max Perutz [Crick’s boss]. And this is all known, so we haven’t discovered this. Watson and Crick used some of the numbers in there from Franklin and Wilkins as a kind of check on their random walk-through of possible structures….</p>



<p>This still looks like kind of underhand, right? Because they&#8217;ve been given this semi-official document. Then two things happened. Firstly, if you read their documents, it&#8217;s quite clear that they do explain that they had access to this document, and that they used it as a check on their models. So this fact is acknowledged at the time….</p>



<p>We then stumbled upon a letter from a Ph.D. student who was at King’s College, called Pauline Cowan, who was a friend of Crick&#8217;s…. So Cowan writes this letter asking him for help with something completely uninteresting. Then she says in passing, “Franklin and Gosling” — that&#8217;s Franklin&#8217;s Ph.D. student who took Photograph 51 — “are giving a seminar on their data.” This is in January 1953. “You can come along if you want. Here&#8217;s the details. But they say that they&#8217;re not really going to go into much detail. It&#8217;s for the general lab audience, and Perutz knows all the results anyway. So you might not want to bother coming.”</p>



<p>In other words, Franklin knows that Watson and Crick will have access to this informal report, and she doesn’t care. It’s all, “Hey, if you want it, that’s fine.” So that then shifts the optic away from they got this surreptitious access to this MRC report. So we’re back to this collaborative [picture]. Franklin doesn’t seem to be too bothered.</p>



<p>And then the final element … we found a program of a Royal Society exhibition…. This is two months after the publication of the papers. [In the program] is a brief summary of the structure of DNA signed by everybody, presented by Franklin.</p>



<p>It was like a school science fair. She’s standing there in front of a model explaining it to everybody, and all their names are on it. So this isn’t a race that’s been won by Watson and Crick. I mean, they did get there first, don’t get us wrong. But it wasn’t seen that way at the time. They could not have done it without the data from Franklin. And Wilkins. And everybody — at least at this stage in 1953 — is accepting that and seems okay with it.</p>



<p>Just like the Joan Bruce article said. So this changes the mood, right? We’re moving away from the Hollywood thriller that Watson wrote, where he’s sneaked some data. That version is really exciting. It’s just not true. [We’re moving] to something that’s much more collaborative, modern in some respects, about sharing data.</p>



<p>Today, we focus on Franklin because we’re currently interested in equality, women’s oppression, and so on. We’re also obsessed with DNA. But people weren’t back then. DNA wasn’t then what it is now. [People might think] how could Franklin not have been livid? This was the secret of life and she had had it taken away from her. But it wasn’t and she didn’t.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>Did Franklin understand the importance of her data?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> Franklin was very skilled at being able to move DNA between two forms; what’s called the A form, which is the crystalline form which gives really precise images, and what’s called the B form. That form is what you get if there’s much more water around the molecule kind of pulling it into a different shape. And it was very clear from her notes that she thought that the B form was basically the loss of order, that it was disintegrating….</p>

The image, dubbed Photograph 51, is said to have inspired James Watson to realize that DNA is a double helix.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123991">Science History Images / Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you study the double helix story, there’s this this kind of enigma, because there are these two forms, A and B.&nbsp; Franklin studies the A form … [but] it’s never been clear to anybody why she chose that form. And then we realized it’s because she’s a crystallographer. She’s a chemist. And if you’re a chemist, and you’re trying to find the crystalline structure of something, what are you going to look at? The crystal.</p>



<p>It’s easy in retrospect to get in a time machine and go back and whisper in her ear, “Hey, but what’s the inside of the cell like? It’s not very dry, you know. Maybe think about the other form.” But … you can’t do that. That’s against the rules….</p>



<p>Everybody who wants to favor Rosalind Franklin thinks that Watson and Crick were kind of sexist pigs who stole her data. The first bit of that description is probably accurate. The second bit isn’t. They certainly were pretty rude. But they did not steal the data.</p>



<p>This is the popular version of the story which we wanted to undermine. That this Photograph 51, which is the B form, is so striking that Watson, when he’s given a glimpse of it, can instantly realize its significance. According to the story he tells and people who are in favor of Franklin tell, this is the moment he steals her data.</p>



<p>But if you think about it for a minute, you think, “Well, why didn’t Franklin get it if it’s so obvious? This really smart woman who’s much smarter than Watson is about this aspect of science, but she doesn’t get it?” And the answer is very clear when you read her notes. She did get it and she didn’t care. She knew it was some kind of helix, but that was not the structure that interested her.</p>



<p>What [the popular story] does is it removes any agency from Franklin. People are inadvertently presenting her as a negative version, the version that Watson presents. She’s the heroine, but she hasn’t gotten it yet. Why hasn’t she got it? Well, the only implication is what Wilkins says; that she was stubborn and blinkered, which is just not true. So we’re trying to put her back at the center of the story, make her much more human than this harridan that Watson presents her as.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>Do we know if Franklin complained at the time about her data being stolen?</strong></p>



<p>So after the double helix [discovery], Franklin and Wilkins never question Watson and Crick, “How did you do this?” They never fall out with them. They never have a row. They never write anything. Either they were stupid and never asked the question, or they knew [that the data were shared fairly].</p>



<p>Then in [19]54, for example, Franklin’s going to the East Coast to go to this meeting on the West Coast that Watson’s going to as well. And so she writes to Watson, “Dear Jim, I gather you’re getting a car across the states. Can I come with you?” So she tried to hitch a ride on a transcontinental car journey with this man who supposedly had stolen life’s secret from under her nose. That doesn’t make sense.</p>



<p>She was on collegial terms — I don’t think she liked him — but she was on collegial terms with Jim…. They had extensive correspondence because they were in the same area of viral structure.</p>



<p>In the last two or three years of her life, she became very good friends with Crick and with his wife. They went on holiday together in Spain after a conference. After she had her first two operations for ovarian cancer, she went to the Cricks to convalesce. She would send Crick her draft articles and ask his advice. So she clearly didn’t think he was a pig who was going to steal all of that data.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>So they were just much more chill about the whole thing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> They were all much more chill. We look at this, one, through a feminist optic. We being the world. It’s an inverse version of <em>The Double Helix</em>. And, two, through the optic of what would it be like today to discover this? Clearly, you&#8217;d have competing labs, they would not talk to each other, and if one of them had these data, then they would behave exactly like Watson describes it.</p>



<p>But that was not the world of the 1950s. Partly because DNA was not DNA. It wasn&#8217;t clear that it was the genetic material [of life]. So it wasn&#8217;t a big deal.</p>



<p>On Franklin’s tomb there is no mention of DNA. What there is mention of is viruses. &nbsp;Because that&#8217;s the practical work that she was engaged in when she died. She had worked out the structure of the polio virus. DNA wasn&#8217;t a practical thing for another 20 years. Whereas the structure the polio virus, maybe that could save lives.</p>



<p>The way we see her is not how she was seen at the time. She was very famous. She got a page obituary in <em>Nature</em>, obituaries in Britain’s the <em>Times</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. So many of her American colleagues were utterly distraught when they discovered that she died [in 1958]. So you know, she was a very significant person, not just for DNA.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> Dr. Watson is still living. Have you spoken with him or anyone else who’s still around that could offer some insight?</p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> I&#8217;ve spoken with him many times, and he knows about this project. But he&#8217;s not in any [physical] shape right now to be able to comment on something like this. Believe me, I would love to, but it&#8217;s just not possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/native-language-shape-musical-ability">Native language might shape musical ability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Your mother tongue may modify your musical ability.</p>



<p>Speaking a native language that requires tones appears to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.03.067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost perception of melody, but at the cost of rhythm</a>, researchers report April 26 in <em>Current Biology</em>. The massive global study hints at how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-wires-native-language-neurons">language skills seep into other areas of cognition</a> (<em>SN: 3/29/23</em>).</p>



<p>Tonal languages use pitch to distinguish words that otherwise might sound the same. In Mandarin, for instance, mă means horse whereas mā means mother. Nontonal languages like Spanish sometimes include pitch changes to suggest emotion, for example, but not to change a word’s meaning.</p>





<p>As a Mandarin speaker and flutist, Jingxuan Liu wondered about the crossover between language and music. While studying psychology as an undergraduate at Duke University, Liu helped analyze the musical abilities of nearly half a million people from 203 countries. Her colleagues had launched an online game in which participants completed several musical tasks, including identifying matching melodies at different pitches and finding beat tracks that fit songs’ rhythms.</p>



<p>On average, native speakers of the 19 represented tonal languages were better at the melody task compared with speakers of 29 nontonal languages. And the effect wasn’t small — a tonal first language enhanced melodic perception by about half the amount that music lessons did, which was also surveyed. But tonal language speakers tended to be worse at the rhythm task.</p>



<p>Humans must be choosy about what they pay attention to. Pitch patterns are vital in tonal languages, which might explain the musical trade-off. “You’ve got a finite resource of attention, and you’ve got to allocate that somehow,” says study coauthor Courtney Hilton, a cognitive scientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Prior research on language and music often compared just two tongues, usually English and Cantonese or Mandarin. But other cultural influences, such as Eastern and Western music styles, could have affected results. By examining a wide range of people, the new study included languages never assessed in this way and reached more generalizable conclusions.</p>



<p>“Our result here is showing that the language someone speaks — which is an important part of culture — also shapes cognition,” Hilton says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permafrost-thawing-pollution-arctic-climate-change">Thawing permafrost may unleash industrial pollution across the Arctic</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the Arctic’s icebound ground warms, it may unleash toxic substances across the region.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, the thaw threatens to destabilize facilities at more than 2,000 industrial sites, such as mines and pipelines, and further compromise <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37276-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 5,000 already contaminated areas</a>, researchers report March 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>Those numbers come from the first comprehensive study to pinpoint where Arctic permafrost thaw could release industrial pollutants. But there are probably even more contaminated areas that we don’t know about, says permafrost researcher Moritz Langer of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, Germany. “We only see the tip of the iceberg.”</p>





<p>Toxic substances released from these locations could jeopardize fish and other animals living in Arctic waterways, as well as the health of people who depend on them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-permafrost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Permafrost</a> is any soil, sediment or rock that remains frozen for at least two years. Step on the ground in the Arctic and chances are that permafrost lies underfoot. For decades, people have treated the frozen earth as staunch and largely immobile. Industries constructed infrastructure atop its firmness, and within it they buried their refuse and sludge. In some places, scientists and others have used permafrost to store radioactive waste.</p>



<p>But the Arctic is warming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">nearly four times as fast</a> as the rest of the planet as a result of climate change, and as much as 65 percent of the region’s permafrost may disappear by 2100 (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>That could release some worrisome things, says climate scientist Kimberley Miner of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the study. In 2021, Miner and her colleagues warned that the thawing of Arctic permafrost <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01162-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could release</a> antibiotic-resistant bacteria, viruses and radioactive waste from nuclear-testing programs into the environment.</p>



<p>Keen to identify where the warming could spread industrial pollutants, Langer and his colleagues first analyzed the range of Arctic permafrost and whereabouts of industrial infrastructure. They identified about 4,500 sites — including oil fields, mines and abandoned military installations — in places where permafrost probably exists. Next, the team used contamination data from Alaska and Canada — regions with accessible records — and found that as of January 2021, about 3,600 contaminated locations occupy the two regions. These include waste areas and places where pollutants were accidentally released.</p>



<p>Realistically, these numbers are probably deflated, Langer says, because many incidents of contamination have probably gone undocumented.</p>





<p>Focusing on Alaska, the researchers found that diesel, gasoline and related petrochemicals make up about half of the pollutants reported. Lead, arsenic and mercury — substances toxic to fish, people and other organisms — were reported too. But in many cases, the type of pollutant was not documented. “That’s a big problem,” Langer says, in part because it makes understanding the risks of a particular leak or spill much harder.</p>



<p>Using the locations of industrial sites and North American contamination data, Langer and colleagues extrapolated where industrial contamination and permafrost might coexist across the entirety of the Arctic, finding 13,000 to 20,000 such sites may exist today. Then, they used computer simulations to investigate the impact of current and future levels of climate change.</p>



<p>Today, there may already be a risk of permafrost degrading at about 1,000 of the known industrial sites and 2,200 to 4,800 of the known and estimated contaminated locations, they found.</p>



<p>In a low-emissions scenario in which warming rises by up to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, those numbers increase to more than 2,100 industrial sites and 5,600 to 10,000 contaminated areas. An increase of about 4.3 degrees C would probably affect almost all the known and projected locations.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re going to need to think about keeping [pollutants] where they need to be,” Miner says, “not just leaving them on the landscape where we feel like.”</p>



<p>The new findings are probably conservative, Langer says, partly because the analysis didn’t consider that infrastructure itself can warm the ground. What’s more, even if it doesn’t fully thaw, “warming of the permafrost causes quite a bit of problem,” says civil engineer Guy Doré of Université Laval in Quebec City, who wasn’t involved in the study. Permafrost that warms from –5° C to –2° C can lose half of its load-bearing capacity, he says, destabilizing infrastructure.</p>



<p>Today, no international regulations mandate industries in the Arctic to document the substances they use and store, or what happens to them. Without that information, Langer says, it’ll be difficult to assess and manage the growing risk of contamination.</p>



<p>He plans to visit decades-old oil drilling facilities in Canada to study how the changing permafrost has affected the containment of drilling fluids. “That&#8217;s the next step,” he says, “to understand better how [industrial contaminants] spread into the landscape.”</p>

<p>Last week, we brought you the story of a professor who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">found her name</a> on an article she didn’t write, which also seemed to have been plagiarized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since our story was published, we’ve learned a little more about the journal that published the article, the <em>African Journal of Political Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.buse.ac.zw/faculties/science/geography-department/prof-jephias-mapuva/">Jephias Mapuva</a>, a professor at the Bindura University of Science Education in Zimbabwe, who is listed as the <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/editorial-board.html">editor in chief of the journal</a>, told us in an email that he is “not associated with the journal in any way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It came to me as a surprise that I am listed as an Editor-In-Chief,” he wrote. He also copied an email address for the journal publisher, International Scholars Journal, and asked for his name to be removed from the website:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126985"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>THIS IS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING and an inconvenience on my profile.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal’s <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/editorial-board.html">editorial board</a> also includes a couple of engineering professors and a “Commercial Manager of Multifarious Projects Group” in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As commenters on our original story pointed out, another <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps"><em>African Journal of Political Science</em></a> exists with the same ISSN listed on the International Scholars Journals website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its information page states the publication is an open-access journal that does not charge article processing fees, and is an outlet of the African Association of Political Science. The journal seems to have <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps/issue/archive">restarted publishing last year</a>, after halting in 2004. The International Scholars Journals publication has <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/archive.html">put out issues</a> continuously since 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uj.ac.za/members/siphamandla-zondi/">Siphamandla Zondi</a>, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, who is listed as <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps/about/editorialTeam">editor in chief</a> of the <em>African Journal of Political Science</em> not affiliated with International Scholars Journals, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>International Scholars Journals is included on Jeffrey Beall’s list of “potentially predatory journals and publishers,” other commenters noted. Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado, Denver, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/">took down the list</a> in 2017, but <a href="https://beallslist.net/">archived versions</a> remain online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenter <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/#comment-2160242">Chung-Chuan Lo</a> shared a link to an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/scam-journal-pretending-real-thing-nadine-bekkouche/">account</a> of another academic’s encounter with the alleged <em>African Journal of Political Science</em>. She described what happened after submitting a commentary, at the journal’s invitation:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Then the hustle for money started. The price was initially over 1000 euros. Obscene. Then they called me (!), they kept emailing, they would not hear my (several) requests to withdraw the article, and they are still emailing. This is frankly abusive. Oh, and they tried to charge a withdrawal fee, before deciding to keep the article. This sort of harassement qualifies the operation as fraudulent and engaging in spearphishing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As for why the journal published an article attributed to someone who didn’t write it, several commenters speculated that the publisher was attempting to fill issues with copy and apply a veneer of respectability with the name of a legitimate academic. We’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/29/meet-the-publisher-making-the-science-of-bronte-faulkner-and-whitman-available-for-the-first-time/">previously reported</a> on similar attempts using the names of famous authors including Walt Whitman and Charlotte Brontë.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sapphire-schrodingers-cat-quantum">A sapphire Schrödinger’s cat shows that quantum effects can scale up</a></h4>

              
                <p>In keeping with the grand tradition of tubby cats, a newly created quantum “cat” is particularly massive — at least for the quantum realm.</p>



<p>Scientists put a jiggling piece of sapphire crystal in what’s known as a “cat state,” in which an object exists in two different states simultaneously. It’s a situation reminiscent of physicists’ favorite imaginary feline, Schrödinger’s cat, known for being alive and dead at the same time.</p>



<p>The new sapphire cat <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf7553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a relatively hefty 16 micrograms</a>, physicists report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>. That’s close to half the mass of an eyelash, and more than 100 trillion times the mass of cat states previously created with molecules. “We’ve reached a new regime where quantum mechanics apparently does work,” says physicist Yiwen Chu of ETH Zurich.</p>





<p>In a quantum parable dreamt up in the 1930s by physicist Erwin Schrödinger, a cat is trapped in a box and, due to quantum effects, winds up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/schrödingers-cat-now-dead-and-alive-two-boxes-once">alive and dead at the same time</a> (<em>SN: 5/26/16</em>). This paradoxical scenario doesn’t happen in the real world. While quantum particles are capable of existing in two distinct states simultaneously — what’s called a superposition — those effects wash out for cat-sized stuff.</p>



<p>Quantum effects are typically confined to atoms, molecules and the like. The everyday world visible to human eyes doesn’t exhibit quantum properties. Scientists can coax certain tiny objects to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spooky-quantum-entanglement-goes-big-new-experiments">display quantum features</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/18</em>). But scientists don’t fully understand the border between the quantum and nonquantum realms.</p>



<p>“We really have only just begun to understand that intermediate regime,” says Benjamin Sussman of the University of Ottawa, who was not involved with the new study. “It’s of really profound interest to see how these quantum systems scale and how they behave.”</p>



<p>Cat states are a special variety of quantum behavior that come close to re-creating Schrödinger’s idea. They are superpositions of two states that are distinct according to the classical physics that describes the everyday world— like an alive or dead cat — rather than two states that exist only in the quantum domain, such as the energy levels of an atom.</p>



<p>In the new experiment, the researchers jiggled a portion of a sapphire crystal in such a way that its atoms moved in two directions at once. That’s a distinction that “captures the spirit” of Schrödinger’s cat, Chu says.</p>



<p>The jiggling was confined within a sliver of the crystal consisting of 100 million billion atoms. That’s large enough that, if extracted from the rest of the crystal, it would be visible to the naked eye, Chu says.</p>





<p>Still, the oscillations of the atoms were tiny, about a millionth of a billionth of a millimeter — not exactly the scale of everyday objects. Other demonstrations of cat states have demonstrated much larger spatial separation, despite being made up of fewer atoms.</p>



<p>In future work, Sussman says he’d like to see the researchers scale up not only the mass, but also the size of the oscillations. “That’s going to be really hard but will be really interesting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-trees-drought-survival-secrets">Ultrasound reveals trees’ drought-survival secrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>The tissues of living trees may hold the secrets of why some can recover after drought and others die. But those tissues are challenging to assess in mature forests. After all, 90-year-old trees can’t travel to the lab to get an imaging scan. So most studies of the impacts of drought on plants are done in the lab and on younger trees — or by gouging cores out of mature trees.</p>



<p>Barbara Beikircher, an ecophysiologist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, and colleagues came up with a different approach: They brought the lab to the trees.</p>



<p>In the Kranzberg Forest outside Munich, the team outfitted stands of mature spruce and beech trees with rugged, waterproof ultrasound sensors. Some of the stands had been covered by roofs to block the summer rain, creating artificial drought conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="500" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1.jpg" alt="A photo of several trees with ultrasound equipment strapped to the trunks and short green fences surrounding the trees." class="wp-image-3123551" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-521x383.jpg 521w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-612x450.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-253x186.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123551">Researchers outfitted stands of mature spruce and beech trees with ultrasound sensors and electrical probes to figure how the species cope with long dry spells.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123551">University of Innsbruck</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Five years of monitoring revealed that beeches (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>) are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/plb.13444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more drought-resilient than spruces</a> (<em>Picea abies</em>), the team reported in the December <em>Plant Biology</em>. Delving into the underlying mechanisms explained this difference.</p>



<p>Drought-stressed trees produced more ultrasound signals than trees exposed to summer rains. Those faint acoustic waves were bouncing off air bubbles called embolisms deep within the trees’ vasculature. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-sap-water-power-energy-world">Surface tension keeps water moving</a> through a tree’s thousands of tiny vessels — evaporation from pores in leaves drives water up the trunk (<em>SN: 9/6/22</em>). But if there’s insufficient water in the soil, this upward pull can generate embolisms that clog vessels. In the experiments, spruces pinged much more than beeches, suggesting they had far more embolisms.</p>





<p>That’s despite the fact that beeches appear to be less conservative with their water management, at least aboveground. Trees can prevent embolisms by closing the pores on their leaves, but there’s a trade-off. Doing so cuts off the supply of the carbon dioxide that drives photosynthesis, which makes the carbohydrates and sugars that trees need to live and grow. In dry conditions, trees face an impossible choice “between starving and dying of thirst,” Beikircher says.</p>



<p>Beeches suffered fewer embolisms than the spruce, even though they kept their pores open longer than the conifers did. Perhaps that’s because beeches have roots that extend into deeper, wetter soil as well as more robust water reserves, Beikircher says. Another set of experiments after the researchers relieved the drought suggests that’s the case.</p>



<p>At the end of the experiment, the team drenched the soil. All the trees recovered well by most measures: Rates of photosynthesis in the previously parched trees caught up to the rates of trees in the control groups and embolisms filled with water.</p>



<p>But when Beikircher measured the trees’ resistance to an electrical current, an indication of moisture levels deep within trunks, the spruces’ water reserves were still depleted. One season of rain was not enough to help these trees fully recover. It’s unclear whether spruces can replenish their reserves after prolonged drought or how long that might take.</p>





<p>Species that can withstand drought conditions and recover more quickly may become more populous in future forests as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate change causes droughts to become more frequent</a> and intense (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). That means the compositions of the trees that make up the world’s temperate forests could change as the climate warms, with uncertain consequences for the other plants and animals in these ecosystems.</p>



<p>Beikircher plans to test whether a more diverse forest could help drought-sensitive species like the spruce survive. Deep-rooted beeches interspersed with spruces might help increase moisture in the soil’s upper levels by wicking water up to where spruce roots are, she says.</p>

<p><em>We are pleased to present an excerpt from <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/distrust-9780192868459?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Distrust: Big Data, Data-Torturing, and the Assault on Science</a>, a new book by Pomona College economics professor <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/gary-n-smith">Gary Smith</a>. The Washington Post said the book&#8217;s lessons &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/03/23/smith-distrust-review-data-disinformation/">are very much needed</a></em>.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The fact that changes in bitcoin prices are driven by fear, greed, and manipulation has not stopped people from trying to crack their secret. Empirical models of bitcoin prices are a wonderful example of data torturing because bitcoins have no intrinsic value and, so, cannot be explained credibly by economic data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Undaunted by this reality, a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24877">National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) paper</a> reported the mind-boggling efforts made by Yale University economics professor <a href="https://economics.yale.edu/people/aleh-tsyvinski">Aleh Tsyvinski</a> and a graduate student, Yukun Liu, to find empirical patterns in bitcoin prices.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126972"></span>



<p>Tsyvinski currently holds an endowed chair named after Arthur M. Okun, who had been a professor at Yale from 1961 to 1969, though he spent six of those eight years on leave so that he could work in Washington on the Council of Economic Advisors as a staff economist, council member, and then chair, advising presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on their economic policies. He is most well known for Okun’s law, which states that a 1 percentage-point reduction in unemployment will increase U.S. output by roughly 2 percent, an argument that helped persuade President Kennedy that using tax cuts to reduce unemployment from 7 to 4 percent would have an enormous economic payoff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Okun’s death, an anonymous donor endowed a lecture series at Yale named after Okun, explaining that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Arthur Okun combined his special gifts as an analytical and theoretical economist with his great concern for the well-being of his fellow citizens into a thoughtful, pragmatic, and sustaining contribution to his nation’s public policy.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The contrast between Okun’s focus on meaningful economic policies and Tsyvinski’s far-fetched bitcoin calculations is striking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liu and Tsyvinski report correlations between the number of weekly Google searches for the word bitcoin (compared to the average over the past four weeks) and the percentage changes in bitcoin prices one to seven weeks later. They also looked at the correlation between the weekly ratio of bitcoin hack searches to bitcoin searches and the percentage changes in bitcoin prices one to seven weeks later. The fact that they reported bitcoin search results looking back four weeks and forward seven weeks should alert us to the possibility that they tried other backward-and-forward combinations that did not work as well. Ditto with the fact that they did not look back four weeks with bitcoin hack searches. They evidently tortured the data in their quest for correlations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, only seven of their fourteen correlations seemed promising for predicting bitcoin prices. Owen Rosebeck and I looked at the predictions made by these correlations during the year following their study and found that they were useless. They might as well have flipped coins to predict bitcoin prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liu and Tsyvinski also calculated the correlations between the number of weekly Twitter bitcoin posts and bitcoin returns one to seven weeks later. Unlike the Google trends data, they did not report results for bitcoin hack posts. Three of the seven correlations seemed useful, though two were positive and one was negative. With fresh data, none were useful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only thing that their data abuse yielded was coincidental statistical correlations. Even though the research was done by an eminent Yale professor and published by the prestigious NBER, the idea that bitcoin prices can be predicted reliably from Google searches and Twitter posts was a fantasy fueled by data torturing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The irony here is that scientists created statistical tools that were intended to ensure the credibility of scientific research but have had the perverse effect of encouraging researchers to torture data—which makes their research untrustworthy and undermines the credibility of all scientific research.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Traditionally, empirical research begins by specifying a theory and then collecting appropriate data for testing the theory. Many now take the shortcut of looking for patterns in data unencumbered by theory. This is called data mining in that researchers rummage through data, not knowing what they will find.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Way back in 2009, Marc Prensky, a writer and speaker with degrees from Yale and Harvard Business School, claimed that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In many cases, scientists no longer have to make educated guesses, construct hypotheses and models, and test them with data-based experiments and examples. Instead, they can mine the complete set of data for patterns that reveal effects, producing scientific conclusions without further experimentation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We are hard-wired to seek patterns but the data deluge makes the vast majority of patterns waiting to be discovered illusory and useless. Bitcoin is again a good example. Since there is no logical theory (other than greed and market manipulation) that explains fluctuations in bitcoin prices, it is tempting to look for correlations between bitcoin prices and other variables without thinking too hard about whether the correlations make sense. In addition to torturing data, Liu and Tsyvinski mined their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They calculated correlations between bitcoin prices and 810 other variables, including such whimsical items as the Canadian dollar–U.S. dollar exchange rate, the price of crude oil, and stock returns in the automobile, book, and beer industries. You might think I am making this up. Sadly, I am not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They reported finding that bitcoin returns were positively correlated with stock returns in the consumer goods and health care industries and negatively correlated with stock returns in the fabricated products and metal mining industries. These correlations don’t make any sense and Liu and Tsyvinski admitted that they had no idea why these data were correlated: “We don’t give explanations . . . . We just document this behavior.” A skeptic might ask: What is the point of documenting coincidental correlations?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that is all they found. The Achilles heel of data mining is that large data sets inevitably contain an enormous number of coincidental correlations that are just fool’s gold in that they are no more useful than correlations among random numbers. Most fortuitous correlations do not hold up with fresh data, though some, coincidentally, will for a while. One statistical relationship that continued to hold during the period they studied and the year afterward was a negative correlation between bitcoin returns and stock returns in the paperboard-containers-and-boxes industry. This is surely serendipitous—and pointless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have assembled enormous databases and created powerful computers and algorithms for analyzing data. The irony is that these resources make it very easy to use data mining to discover chance patterns that are fleeting. Results are reported and then discredited, and we become increasingly skeptical of scientists.</p>

                <p>Mars’ heart is about the size of our moon, and almost twice as dense. Or so suggest the first observed rumblings from a Marsquake and meteorite impact to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217090120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross the Red Planet’s heart</a>, researchers report April 24 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The penetrative reverberations allowed researchers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">refine estimates of the core’s size, density and composition</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Nobody&#8217;s ever seen before a seismic wave going through [Mars’] core,” says seismologist Jessica Irving from the University of Bristol in England. “We waited for more than 900 days for one quake on the farside,” she says. Then “24 days later, there was … a meteorite impact.”</p>

<p>Both were captured by NASA’s InSight lander, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-dart-artemis-space-news-2022">monitored seismic activity on Mars</a> for four years, up until December 2022 (<em>SN: 12/20/22</em>). Over its 1,480-day career, the lander captured the quivers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-volcanic-activity-planet-nasa-insight">over 1,000 Marsquakes</a> and a handful of impacts (<em>SN: 11/3/22</em>). But in all that time, it detected just two rumblings on the planet’s farside.</p>



<p>Analyzing the core-crossing seismicity from the two events, Irving and her colleagues found that Mars’ heart has a radius of 1,780 to 1,810 kilometers with a density of about 6,200 kilograms per cubic meter. That radius is slightly smaller than previously estimated, and about half that of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">combined layers of Earth’s heart</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/23</em>). The cores of both planets comprise about half of their total thickness.</p>



<p>Moreover, the researchers inferred that Mars’ core is mostly made of a liquid iron alloy, with sulfur making up about 15 percent of its mass. A smattering of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon together comprise about 5 percent. The findings roughly align with some previous analyses of Martian meteorite compositions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rocky-planets-early-universe-james-webb-telescope">Rocky planets might have been able to form in the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rocky planets might have been forming since the beginning of the universe. A stellar nursery in a neighboring galaxy <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01945-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the right materials for such planet formation</a>, researchers report April 24 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The overall chemical makeup of the tiny galaxy, called the Small Magellanic Cloud, is akin to that of the early universe. The finding suggests that rocky planets might have been able to develop in the relatively pristine chemical environment that pervaded the cosmos just a couple billion years after the Big Bang.</p>





<p>The Small Magellanic Cloud is one of the Milky Way’s nearest galactic neighbors, though it’s very different from our galaxy. The tiny galaxy has a much lower abundance of heavy metal elements — such as iron, magnesium and aluminum — which are all crucial to the formation of rocky planets. This low-metal environment also mimics that of the early universe, an epoch before stars had enough time to forge the heavy elements and blow them out into space.</p>



<p>Because of the lack of these elements, astronomers have been unsure if rocky planets are able to form in the Small Magellanic Cloud. And previous telescopes did not have the ability to really probe young stars with a mass less than or equal to that of the sun, so astronomers couldn’t measure the star systems’ dust content, which is needed to infer if planets could be being born. But with the sensitivity of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, or JWST, astronomers can now gather more light and see smaller, fainter stars in greater detail (<em>SN: 12/7/22</em>).</p>



<p>Astrophysicist Olivia Jones and colleagues used an infrared camera on JWST to look at a region of the Small Magellanic Cloud called NGC 346, where young stars are forming. “It’s the first time ever we’ve really been able to look at how solar-size stars form in an environment akin to the early universe,” says Jones, of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.</p>



<p>The team detected signatures that suggest that lots of dust is orbiting and falling toward hundreds of stars in the region. As these dust grains orbit, they could begin to stick together and eventually accrete to create rocky planets. </p>



<p>“One of the things we would love to understand better is how the environmental context impacts star formation and then, later on, the planet-forming populations around those young, forming stars,” says Michael Meyer, an astronomer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Because the Small Magellanic Cloud is the nearest example of a cosmic region with a much different chemical composition than the Milky Way, he says, it provides the first touchstone to study how star and planet formation depend on the stellar environment.</p>



<p>The low-metal stellar environment in the Small Magellanic Cloud is comparable to that of faraway galaxies that were developing around 11 billion years ago. During this time, a period called “cosmic noon,” there was a surge of star formation throughout the cosmos. If rocky planets could be accreting around stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, the researchers suggest, such worlds could have been forming in the early years of the universe as well.</p>





<p>The young stars in NGC 346 are also relative lightweights. One reason scientists are interested in studying the possibility of planet formation around low-mass stars is because they are the most common type of stars in the universe and the longest-lived, says Penn State astronomer Kevin Luhman, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>“They offer the longest period of time in which life might form and survive on any planets around them,” Luhman says. “If the most common star in the universe lived for only a million years, then exploded, that would be kind of bad for life.” The fact that these types of stars can potentially form rocky planets, he says, is a good sign for life developing elsewhere in the universe.</p>



<p>Follow-up research will focus on determining what chemical signatures can be found developing around the stars, Jones says. This could clue the researchers in to what the chemical elements are that make up any rocky planets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vegan-leather-fungi-repair-mycelium">A vegan leather made of dormant fungi can repair itself</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine if a ripped leather jacket could repair itself instead of needing to be replaced.</p>



<p>This could one day be a reality, if the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202301875" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jacket is fashioned from fungus</a>, researchers report April 11 in <em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>. The team made a self-healing leather from mushrooms’ threadlike structures called mycelium, building on past iterations of the material to allow it to fix itself.</p>



<p>Mycelium leather is already an emerging product, but it’s produced in a way that extinguishes fungal growth. Elise Elsacker and colleagues speculated that if the production conditions were tweaked, the mycelium could retain its ability to regrow if damaged.</p>





<p>That novel approach could offer inspiration to other researchers trying to get into the mycelium leather market, says Valeria La Saponara, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at the University of California, Davis.</p>



<p>Elsacker, a bioengineer now at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and her colleagues first grew mycelium in a soup rich in proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients. A skin formed on the surface of the liquid, which the scientists scooped off, cleaned and dried to make a thin, somewhat fragile leather material. They used temperatures and chemicals mild enough to form the leather but leave parts of the fungus functional. Left dormant were chlamydospores, little nodules on the mycelium that can spring back to life and grow more mycelium when conditions are prime.</p>



<p>After punching holes in the leather, the researchers doused the area in the same broth used to grow it to revive the chlamydospores. The mycelium eventually regrew over the punctures. Once healed, the hole-punched areas were just as strong as undamaged areas — however, the repairs were visible from one side of the leather.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="139" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline.jpg" alt="Three photos side by side of squares of light-colored leather being held by a hand from the top right corner." class="wp-image-3123876" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041823_JC_living-leather_inline-330x67.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123876">Chlamydospores are little nodules on fungi’s threadlike mycelium that can spring back to life.

Elsacker <em>et al</em>/<em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>, 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The technique could potentially go beyond a proof-of-concept and into commercialization in the next decade, says study coauthor Martyn Dade-Robertson, codirector of the Hub for Biotechnology in the Built Environment in Newcastle upon Tyne. But first, the team will need to make the leather stronger and determine how to control the chlamydospores’ growth. Otherwise, he says, someone could “walk out in the rain, and then all of a sudden find that [their] jacket is growing, or perhaps [has] mushrooms popping out of it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last August, a U.S. federal research misconduct watchdog <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/05/ucla-veteran-researcher-faked-data-in-11-grant-applications-per-feds/">announced findings</a> that a longtime researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles named Janina Jiang faked data in 11 grant applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than a month later, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/23/ucla-walks-back-claim-that-application-for-50-million-grant-included-fake-data/">issued a rare correction</a> to its announcement, saying “additional information” from UCLA indicated that one of the grants “did not fund or contain falsified/fabricated data.” The watchdog agency said it would remove the application in question from its findings of research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The grant, UL1 TR000124, helped fund the UCLA <a href="https://ctsi.ucla.edu/">Clinical and Translational Science Institute</a> (CTSI) with $57 million from 2012-2015. The listed principal investigator, <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/discover-ucla-health/about/leadership/steven-m-dubinett">Steven M. Dubinett</a>, is the interim dean for UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of the correction, we wondered how a report that would have had to be reviewed by multiple officials – and lawyers – at both institutions could include such a mistake, and filed public records requests to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126959"></span>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/07/ucla-found-a-longtime-researcher-faked-data-but-made-a-strange-mistake-in-its-report/">reported last November</a>, through a public records request, we obtained UCLA’s report on its research misconduct investigation of Jiang, as well as two letters from university officials asking ORI to amend the Federal Register notice about its findings to remove the CTSI grant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erroneous information” about the source of funding for Jiang’s research had been given to the inquiry and investigation committees and made it into the report sent to ORI, the second letter stated. But how the mistake happened, or why UCLA didn’t discover it until after ORI announced the findings, remained unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a separate federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, we have <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-01230-Final-Doc.pdf">obtained email correspondence</a> between ORI and Jiang, ORI and UCLA officials, and internal discussions among ORI staffers about the request to correct the Federal Register notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But now we have even more questions. The emails we received were heavily redacted for “<a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-01230-Final-Response-Letter.pdf">unwarranted invasions of personal privacy</a>” and the “<a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/2-522-0897?__lrTS=20201013140117301&amp;transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true">deliberative process privilege</a>,” which allows the government to withhold information on how agency staff members make decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve pieced together the following timeline from the emails. It’s a lot of detail, but we think it offers a glimpse into how the investigation sausage is made:&nbsp;</p>

<li>Aug. 27, 2021: ORI informed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Extramural Research about UCLA’s findings of research misconduct by Jiang in 11 grant applications, including the CTSI grant. (pp. 198-9)</li>



<li>April-May 2022: ORI staff drafted and revised a Voluntary Settlement Agreement (VSA) and other documents related to Jiang’s case. (p. 196)</li>



<li>June 8: A staffer sent Alexander Runko, director of ORI’s Division of Investigative Oversight, a revised memo and VSA. “I have added the UL1 grant back in the documents and [redacted],” he or she wrote. Unstated is why that grant, which UCLA later asked to remove from the findings, had apparently been taken out of the documents before being added back to the file. (p. 192)</li>



<li>June 16: After additional edits and discussion among ORI staff, the agency sent Jiang a letter with the VSA. (p. 186)</li>



<li>June 30: Runko sent Jiang an email following up on a meeting, with a revised VSA and “statements from ORI that you can share with your supervisor” that were redacted. (p. 181)</li>



<li>July 15 and 18: Jiang and Runko exchanged a flurry of emails about the VSA and the supervision plan for Jiang’s research. Runko revised the VSA twice in response to Jiang’s requests. All specifics are redacted. (pp. 151-163)</li>



<li>July 19: Jiang signed the VSA. (p. 151)</li>



<li>July 22: Wanda K. Jones, acting ORI director, approved the VSA, and Elisabeth Handley, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, signed it. (pp. 133-140)</li>



<li>Aug. 2: An NIH staffer asked Runko which submission of the CTSI grant contained the fabricated figure 6 mentioned in the report: “I don’t see an [redacted] after the grant number.” The reply from ORI was almost completely redacted, but the NIH apparently found it “very helpful.” (pp. 200-1)</li>



<li>Aug. 5: ORI’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/05/ucla-veteran-researcher-faked-data-in-11-grant-applications-per-feds/">findings of research misconduct</a> by Jiang were published in the Federal Register.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Aug. 11: An ORI staffer sent a note to Runko about a conversation he or she had with a UCLA official about the Jiang announcement and CTSI grant, and UCLA’s desire for a correction to the Federal Register notice. “UCLA may want to issue a clarification or statement on how the grant (UL1 TR000124) was involved,” the staff member wrote. The staffer said he or she had checked the report and found “it clearly states the UCLA CTSI Grant #UL1 TR000124.” “They did provide a clarification, when I was not able to find the figure in grant [sic],” the staff member wrote, but whatever UCLA said was redacted from the email.</li>



<li>“I don’t see a reason to change anything unless they provide some additional justification,” Runko wrote in a reply the same day.  The staff member replied with a clarification that was mostly redacted. This much was intact: “The issue she is raising is that the questioned figure was not in UL1 grant application submitted to NIH.” (pp. 213-214)</li>



<li>Aug. 16: Roger M. Wakimoto, UCLA’s vice chancellor for research and creative activities, sent a letter to ORI asking the agency to correct the Federal Register notice, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/07/ucla-found-a-longtime-researcher-faked-data-but-made-a-strange-mistake-in-its-report/">we previously reported</a>. Wakimoto wrote that the allegation of fake data regarding the CTSI grant involved a proposal submitted not to the NIH, but to “an intramural granting program supported by funds from the CTSI award.” An ORI staffer sent an email to Runko responding to the letter, but the contents were entirely redacted. (p. 206)</li>



<li>Sept. 9: Wakimoto sent a second letter to ORI, this time saying that UCLA had looked at its records again and found that the CTSI grant had not funded Jiang’s research at all. He again asked ORI to issue a correction to the Federal Register notice. </li>



<li>The following week, ORI said it would issue a correction and staffers drafted and edited the notice, which was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/23/ucla-walks-back-claim-that-application-for-50-million-grant-included-fake-data/">published</a> on September 16. (pp. 220-7)</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/graphene-tattoo-heart-beat-pacemaker">A graphene “tattoo” could help hearts keep their beat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some tattoos truly make the heart go pitter-patter.</p>



<p>In rats, a graphene “tattoo” stuck to the heart could treat an abnormally sluggish beat. Like a futuristic pacemaker, the device <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202212190" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered electrical signals that kept the heart pumping properly</a>, scientists report online March 25 in <em>Advanced Materials</em>.</p>



<p>The electronic device is currently a proof of concept, but a version for use in human hearts could be ready for testing within five years, estimates Igor Efimov, a cardiovascular engineer at Northwestern University in Chicago.</p>





<p>Efimov and his colleagues have worked for years creating implantable devices that conform to the body. A main challenge is how to marry rigid electronics with soft, sometimes throbbing tissues. For most current pacemakers, doctors thread electrodes on long wires through a vein inside the heart. Every time the heart beats, some 100,000 times per day, the wires flex. Enough flexing, and the device eventually breaks, Efimov says. One solution is to use ultrathin materials that ride along with the heart’s movements, like plastic wrap clinging to quivering Jell-O.</p>



<p>In 2021, Efimov saw something that looked promising: a paper on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-00489-8.epdf?sharing_token=nwTP0SrhHXmUfkGcbRj9RdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OMiVvBkaLPGy4yVDu7PE_NOnMmd1OVU3W4IEZLpNRflOILz7IvTycNmeOtTcuBrTcqjvU9OtCQZj2zXEzCWjjStVULnhvf6DO6KuMw_pWVIsuPeHo7wSj4g5hbiMSegCA%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graphene devices applied to the skin like temporary tattoos</a>. Unlike the metal components often used in electronics, graphene is “atomically thin,” says Dmitry Kireev, a biomedical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin who developed the graphene tattoos.</p>

<p>Graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern — is an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worlds-thinnest-material-stretches-bends-twists">appealing material for biomedical use</a>, says Nai-Chang Yeh, a Caltech physicist who was not involved in the work (<em>SN: 3/14/14</em>). “Graphene is very flexible, it’s biocompatible, it’s highly transparent, it’s highly conductive and it’s mechanically strong,” she says.</p>



<p>But Kireev had never placed graphene tattoos on heart tissue before. Efimov contacted him and said, “Well, would you like to try? We can help.” The researchers teamed up and tested the devices in experiments on mouse hearts and inside living rats. In the rats, the heart tattoo could correct an irregular beat by sending pulses of electricity to the organ, the team reports.</p>



<p>The tattoos sandwich a transparent layer of graphene between sheets of stretchy silicone and ultrathin polymer. Gold tape connects the graphene to wires that run to a power source, which sends electricity through the device.</p>





<p>Future versions of the tattoo will be wireless, Efimov says, perhaps using a tiny antenna to pick up electrical signals from an external device placed on a person’s chest. And one day, Efimov envisions graphene electrodes the size of rice grains injected into heart muscle. Such miniature equipment could perform pacemaker duties without the typical clunky components.</p>



<p>That all might sound like science fiction, but the technology is almost here, Efimov says. “Now’s the time to develop it.”</p>

                <h2>PLOS Joins UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, PLOS joined over 290 other publishers in signing the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sdg-publishers-compact/">UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact,</a> an agreement to inspire action among publishers in advancing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by actively seeking and promoting scientific content related to the goals, as well as committing to sustainable actions across our business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SDG Compact provides a framework for publishers to work towards a more sustainable future by seeking and promoting content that advances the SDGs, as well as taking steps to enhance sustainable business practices. This includes a range of activities from how we work with partners, to the opportunities we provide staff to take personal action.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Since our founding in 2001 PLOS has worked to ensure any stakeholder can learn from, build upon, or apply trusted scientific knowledge to advance global progress. By signing the UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s compact, we recognize that Open Science is a critical accelerator for achieving the SDGs and tackling this era&rsquo;s greatest challenges. Through our participation, PLOS seeks to focus and expand the work we&rsquo;re already doing, share and learn best practices from other stakeholders, and collectively harness open research to improve lives across the planet</em></p><cite><strong><em>Alison Mudditt, </em></strong><em>CEO</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<h4>Advancing the SDGs through Open and trusted research</h4>



<p>A significant portion of the articles currently published in PLOS journals are applicable to at least one Sustainable Development Goal and we expect that percentage to grow in the coming years. As with the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new titles</a> we launched in 2021, the SDGs will continue to influence the development of our portfolio and our work with research communities to seek and promote research critical to the health of our planet and its people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the content we publish, the ways in which we surface research and how we represent the broadest spectrum of researchers matter greatly to the success of these goals&ndash; and scholarly publishing more broadly. PLOS is working to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-series">eliminate financial barriers</a> to Open Access publishing and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">partnering with research communities</a> around the world to co-create more equitable solutions for sharing research and ensuring<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> inclusive policies</a> shape our journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our commitment to Open Access and Open Science, we are helping researchers increase the real-world impact of their work by ensuring it can be shared, applied, and reused by anyone who needs it. That commitment extends to research artifacts such as data, protocols, and code that strengthen reproducibility and accelerate progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Representing PLOS and the alignment of our goals with the SDG Publisher&rsquo;s compact, we&rsquo;re pleased to announce Becs Kirk, Publisher, Portfolio Development at PLOS and HESI fellow will act as a spokesperson for PLOS in coordinating our activities and sharing resources with other organizations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>PLOS has a longstanding commitment to working with global research communities who are addressing societal challenges, and to focusing the development of our portfolio to support their needs. I&rsquo;m pleased to represent PLOS in further coordinating our activities and alignment with the UN SDGs. We&rsquo;re shaping journal content, representation on our editorial boards, and the tools we offer researchers to share and promote their work around best practices for advancing a sustainable and inclusive future for all.</em></p><cite><strong><em>Becs Kirk, </em></strong><em>Publisher, Portfolio Development</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<h4>Aligning as an organization</h4>



<p>The strength of PLOS has always been the passionate individuals&ndash;including staff, the researchers to shape our journals, as well as the partners we work with&ndash;who are committed to transforming research communication in ways that build a more equitable foundation for knowledge-sharing.</p>



<p>We strive to live our values inside out, by creating a diverse, collaborative, and conscientious organization that allows these initiatives to flourish. To drive forward our efforts in advancing these goals, we&rsquo;ll be appointing an SDG Steering Committee led by our CEO, Alison Muddit and drawing on the expertise of staff that have led our progress thus far in becoming a more sustainable and inclusive organization. More to come on this soon!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>We built our journal to influence and inform decision-making at every level of society through Open Science. As Executive Editor of PLOS Climate, it&rsquo;s gratifying to see that expertise and guidance from the research community translate directly into best practices that PLOS and other signatories of the Publisher&rsquo;s Compact will take to protect our planet</em></p><cite><strong>Jamie Males</strong>, Executive Editor, <em>PLOS Climate</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>To keep track of progress, research content, and initiatives at PLOS related to the SDGs we&rsquo;re introducing a <a href="https://plos.org/our-commitment-to-sustainability/">new section of our website</a> where our communities can learn more about the work we&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;ll be sharing more updates in this space and on our website as we make progress towards these goals!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-peels-bananas">This elephant peels bananas, but only slightly ripe ones</a></h4>

              
                <p>Do you peel bananas from the top or bottom? One elephant goes with a third option.</p>



<p>When handed a slightly browning banana, Pang Pha, an Asian elephant at Zoo Berlin, will use her trunk to break the fruit, shake the pulp onto the ground, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00266-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discard the peel and then shove the pulp into her mouth</a>, researchers report in the April 10 <em>Current Biology</em>. The rare behavior, previously recorded in just a few elephants, could help shed light on how the animals learn complex movements.</p>





<p>When a zookeeper first told neuroscientist Lena Kaufmann of Humboldt University of Berlin that one of the elephants peeled bananas, she decided to test it out for herself.&nbsp;For weeks, Kaufmann and colleagues couldn’t get Pang Pha to replicate the behavior. That’s because the way the elephant eats bananas seems to depend on ripeness.</p>



<p>Pang Pha ate green and yellow bananas whole — peel and all. It was only when Kaufmann offered the gentle giant a brown-spotted banana that she revealed her peeling prowess. But the fruit can’t be too brown, Kaufmann’s team found. Pang Pha rejected completely brown bananas. Initially she would place them gently on the ground in protest. Now she throws them aside.</p>

She breaks the fruit, shakes the pulp onto the ground, discards the peel and then shoves the pulp into her mouth. Researchers think Pang Pha picked up the rare skill by observing her zookeepers.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the company of other elephants, Pang Pha surprisingly ate most yellow-brown bananas whole. She typically saved her peeling trick for the last banana during a social feeding session.</p>



<p>Pang Pha may have developed the peeling ability by observing her human caretakers, the researchers suspect. Elephants learning behaviors from people is extremely rare, the team says, especially a behavior this complex. None of the other elephants at the zoo — including Pang Pha’s daughter — have been observed peeling bananas. That suggests the skill isn’t easily learned from elephant to elephant.<br><br>The new study shows the value of studying individual animals, Kaufmann says. “There’s such a rich landscape of behaviors that we lose if we only look at what all elephants have in common,” she says. “If you look at each individual elephant, you can see that they’re able to do really amazing things.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cavern-west-antarctic-glacier-life">A massive cavern beneath a West Antarctic glacier is teeming with life</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The coastal plain of the Kamb Ice Stream, a West Antarctic glacier, hardly seems like a coast at all. Stand in this place, 800 kilometers from the South Pole, and you see nothing but flat ice extending in every direction. The ice is some 700 meters thick and stretches for hundreds of kilometers off the coastline, floating on the water. On clear summer days, the ice reflects the sunlight with such ferocity that it inflicts sunburn in the insides of your nostrils. It might seem hard to believe, but hidden beneath this ice is a muddy tidal marsh, where a burbling river wends its way into the ocean.</p>



<p>Until recently, no human had ever glimpsed that secret landscape. Scientists had merely inferred its existence from the faint reflections of radar and seismic waves. But in the closing days of 2021, a team of scientists from New Zealand melted a narrow hole through the glacier’s ice and lowered in a camera. They had hoped that their hole would intersect with the river, which they believed had melted a channel up into the ice — a vast water-filled cavity, nearly tall enough to hold the Empire State Building and half as long as Manhattan. On December 29, Craig Stevens finally got his first look inside. It is a moment that he will always remember.</p>





<p>Stevens is a physical oceanographer with New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Wellington. He spent 90 anxious minutes that day in Antarctica with his head buried ostrich-style under a thick down jacket to block the sunlight that would otherwise obscure his computer monitor. There, he watched live video from the camera as it descended into the hole. Icy circular walls scrolled past, reminiscent of a cosmic wormhole. Suddenly, at a depth of 502 meters, the walls widened out.</p>



<p>Stevens shouted for a colleague to halt the winch lowering the camera. He stared at the screen as the camera rotated idly on its cable. Its floodlights raked across a ceiling of glacial ice — a startling sight — scalloped into delicate crests and waves. It resembled the dreamy undulations that might take millennia to form in a limestone cavern.</p>

<p>“The interior of a cathedral,” says Stevens. A cathedral not only in beauty, but also in size. As the winch restarted, the camera journeyed downward for another half hour, through 242 meters of sunless water. Bits of reflective silt stirred up by currents streamed back down like snowflakes through the black void.</p>



<p>Stevens and his colleagues spent the next two weeks lowering instruments into the void. Their observations revealed that this coastal river has melted a massive, steep-walled cavern cutting as far as 350 meters up into the overlying ice. The cavern extends for at least 10 kilometers and appears to be boring inland, farther upstream, into the ice sheet with each passing year.</p>



<p>This cavity offers researchers a window into the network of subglacial rivers and lakes that extends hundreds of kilometers inland in this part of West Antarctica. It’s an otherworldly environment that humans have barely explored and is laden with evidence of Antarctica’s warm, distant past, when it was still inhabited by a few stunted trees.</p>

<p>One of the biggest surprises came as the camera reached bottom that day. Stevens gazed in disbelief as dozens of orange blurs swam and darted on his monitor — evidence that this place, roughly 500 kilometers from the open, sunlit ocean, is nonetheless bustling with marine animals.</p>



<p>Seeing them was “just complete shock,” says Huw Horgan, a glaciologist formerly at the Victoria University of Wellington who led the drilling expedition.</p>





<p>Horgan, who recently moved to ETH Zurich, wants to know how much water is flowing through the cavern and how its growth will impact the Kamb Ice Stream over time. Kamb is unlikely to fall apart anytime soon; this part of West Antarctica is not immediately threatened by climate change. But the cavern might still offer clues to how subglacial water could affect more vulnerable glaciers.</p>



<h4>What’s beneath Antarctica’s ice sheet?</h4>



<p>Scientists have long surmised that a veneer of liquid water sits beneath much of the ice sheet covering Antarctica. This water forms as the bottom of the ice slowly melts, several penny-thicknesses per year, due to heat seeping from the Earth’s interior. In 2007, Helen Amanda Fricker, a glaciologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1136897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported evidence</a> that this water pools into large lakes beneath the ice and can flood quickly from one lake to another (<em>SN: 6/17/06, p. 382</em>).</p>



<p>Fricker was looking at data from NASA’s Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, or ICESat, which measures the height of the ice surface by reflecting a laser off of it. The surface at several spots in West Antarctica seemed to bob up and down, rising and falling by as much as nine meters over a couple of years. She interpreted these active spots as subglacial lakes. As they filled and then spilled out their water, the overlying ice rose and fell. Fricker’s team and several others <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Siegert/publication/259427117_A_fourth_inventory_of_Antarctic_subglacial_lakes_Antarctic/links/550821bd0cf27e990e0915ce/A-fourth-inventory-of-Antarctic-subglacial-lakes-Antarctic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually found over 350</a>&nbsp;of these lakes scattered around Antarctica, including a couple dozen beneath Kamb and its neighboring glacier, the Whillans Ice Stream.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Where are Antarctica’s subglacial lakes?</h3>



<p>Hundreds of subglacial lakes have been found scattered across Antarctica. Samples have been taken from a few (Lake Whillans is shown). Red circles show stable lakes discovered through ice-penetrating radar. Blue triangles show lakes that have been observed draining at least once.</p>

<p>The lakes provoked great interest because they were expected to harbor life and might provide insights about what sorts of organisms could survive on other worlds — deep within the ice-covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn, for instance. The layers of sediment in Antarctica’s lakes might also offer glimpses into the continent’s ancient climate, ecosystems and ice cover. Teams funded by Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States attempted to drill into subglacial lakes. In 2013, the U.S.-led team succeeded, melting through 800 meters of ice and tapping into a reservoir called Subglacial Lake Whillans. It was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lake-under-antarctic-ice-bursts-life">teeming with microbes</a>, 130,000 cells per milliliter of lake water (<em>SN: 9/20/14, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Horgan helped map Lake Whillans before drilling began. But by the time the lake was breached, he and others were becoming intrigued with another facet of the subglacial landscape — the rivers thought to carry water from one lake to another, and eventually to the ocean.</p>



<p>Finding these hidden rivers requires complicated guesswork. Their flow paths are influenced not only by the subglacial topography, but also by differences in the thickness of the overlying ice. Water moves from places where the ice is thick (and the pressure high) to places where it is thinner (and the pressure lower) — meaning that rivers can sometimes run uphill.</p>



<p>By 2015, scientists had mapped the likely paths of several dozen subglacial rivers. But drilling into them still seemed farfetched. The rivers are narrow targets and their exact locations often uncertain. But around that time, Horgan got a lucky break.</p>



<p>While examining a satellite photo of the Kamb Ice Stream, he noticed a wrinkle in the pixelated tapestry of the image. The wrinkle resembled a long, shallow trough in the surface of the ice, as if the ice had sagged from melting beneath. The trough sat several kilometers from the hypothetical path of one subglacial river. Horgan believed that it marked the spot where that river flowed over the coastal plain and spilled into the ice-covered sea.</p>



<p>In 2016, while visiting the area for an unrelated research project, Horgan and his companions detoured briefly to the surface trough to take radar measurements. Sure enough, they found a void under the ice, filled with liquid water. Horgan began making plans to study it more closely. He would return twice in the next few years, once to map the river in detail and a second time to drill into it. What he found greatly exceeded his expectations.</p>



<h4>Scientists map a subglacial landscape</h4>



<p>Horgan and graduate student Arran Whiteford of the Victoria University of Wellington visited the lower Kamb Ice Stream to map the river in December 2019.</p>



<p>After weeks on the Antarctic ice sheet, they’d grown accustomed to its monotonous flat landscape, their perception sensitized to even tiny ups and downs. In this context, the surface trough “looked like this massive chasm,” Whiteford says, “like an amphitheater” — even though it slanted no more dramatically than a rolling cornfield in Iowa.</p>



<p>It was a week of scientific drudgery, towing the ice-penetrating radar behind a snowmobile along a series of straight, parallel lines that crisscrossed the trough to map the shape of the river channel under the ice.</p>



<p>Horgan and Whiteford worked up to 12 hours per day, occasionally trading positions. One person drove the snowmobile, straining his thumb on the throttle to maintain a constant 8&nbsp;kilometers per hour. Two sleds hissed along behind. One held a transmitter that fired radar waves into the glacier below; the other held an antenna that received the signal reflected back off the bottom of the ice. The second person rode on the sled with the antenna, his eyes on a bouncing laptop screen making sure that the radar was functioning.</p>

HORGAN</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Each evening they huddled in their tent, reviewing their radar traces. The river channel appeared far more dramatic than the gentle dip atop the ice suggested. Below their boots sat a vast water-filled cavern with steep sides like a train tunnel, 200&nbsp;meters to a kilometer wide and cutting as much as 50&nbsp;percent of the way up through the glacier. The more they looked, the more it resembled a river. “It kind of meanders downstream,” Whiteford says.</p>



<p>All told, Whiteford made two weeklong visits to the trough, snowmobiling over from another camp 50 kilometers away. The first time he was accompanied by Horgan, and the second time by another graduate student, Martin Forbes.</p>



<p>After returning home to New Zealand in January 2020, Whiteford examined a series of old satellite images. They showed that the surface trough — and hence, the cavern — had begun forming at least 35 years before, starting with a blip at the very mouth of the river, where it ran into the ocean. That blip had gradually lengthened, reaching progressively farther inland, or upstream. Whiteford and Horgan <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JF006532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported the observations</a> in late 2022 in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</em> — along with their theory about how the cavern formed.</p>



<p>In other parts of Antarctica where the ice sheet protrudes off the coastline, scientists have found that the ice’s underside <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2018JC013987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is often insulated from the ocean heat by a buoyant layer</a> of colder, fresher meltwater. That protective layer is sometimes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a couple of meters thick</a>. But Horgan and Whiteford suspect that the turbulence of the subglacial river flowing into the ocean stirs up that protective layer, causing seawater — a few tenths of a degree warmer than the subglacial water — to swirl up into contact with the ice. This causes an area of concentrated melt right at the river’s mouth, creating a small cavity where warm seawater can intrude further.</p>



<p>In this way, says Horgan, the focal point of melting is “stepping back over time.” And the cavern gradually burrows farther upstream into the ice.</p>



<p>Whiteford used a different set of satellite measurements — which measured the rate at which the ice’s surface sank over time — to determine how quickly the ice was melting in the cavern below. Based on this, he estimated that in the upstream end of the cavern, the ice (currently 350 to 500 meters thick over the channel) was melting and thinning 35 meters per year. That’s an astronomical rate. It’s 135 times what has been measured 50 kilometers southwest of the cavern, where the ice floats on the ocean. The water temperature is probably similar at both locations. But the turbulence caused by the river transfers the water’s heat far more efficiently into the ice.</p>



<p>Horgan thinks that the cavern at Kamb also owes its dramatic height to another factor. Glaciers in this part of West Antarctica generally flow several hundred meters per year. So the melt caused by a flowing river beneath, over years or decades, would normally be spread out over a long swath of ice. This would erode a shallow channel rather than a deep cleft. But Kamb is an oddball. Around 150 years ago, it stopped moving almost entirely due to the cyclical interplay of melting and freezing at its base. It now creeps forward only about 10 meters per year. The melting is thus concentrated, year after year, in almost the same spot.</p>



<p>Back in 2020, all of this was still conjecture. But if Horgan and his colleagues could return, drill into the cavern and lower instruments into it, they could confirm how it formed. By studying the water, sediment and microbes flowing out of it, they could also learn a lot about Antarctica’s vast subglacial landscape.</p>



<p>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet covers an area three times the size of the Colorado River drainage basin, which sprawls across Arizona, Utah, Colorado and parts of four other states. To date, humans have observed only a tiny swath of this underworld, smaller than a basketball court — represented by several dozen narrow boreholes scattered across the region, where scientists have grabbed a bit of mud from the bottom or sometimes lowered in a camera.</p>



<p>Horgan was eager to explore more. With New Zealand already melting boreholes through ice floating on the ocean, drilling into this coastal river seemed like a natural next step.</p>



<h4>How did the hidden cavern form?</h4>



<p>On December 4, 2021, a pair of caterpillar-tracked PistenBullys arrived at the place where Horgan and Whiteford had visited two years before. The tractors had traveled for 16 days from New Zealand’s Scott Base on the edge of the continent, growling across a thousand kilometers of floating ice as they towed a convoy of sleds packed with 90 metric tons of food, fuel and scientific gear. The convoy lumbered around to the upstream end of the valley and stopped.</p>



<p>Workers erected a tent the size of a small aircraft hangar, and inside it, assembled a series of water heaters, pumps and a kilometer of hose — a machine called a hot water drill. Using shovels and a small mechanized scooper, they dumped 54 tons of snow into a tank and melted it. The workers then jetted that hot water through the hose, using it to melt a narrow hole, no wider than a dinner plate, through 500 meters of ice — and down through the domed ceiling of the cavern.</p>

<h3>The cavern’s size and shape</h3>



<p>This 3-D rendering shows the shape of the cavern, based on radar traces. Scientists think it is being carved back from the coastline as a river flowing beneath the ice meets the ocean and stirs up the water there. The 2-D illustration shows what a rough cross section at one point might look like, with ice above and ground beneath.</p>

<p>The sight of animals inside the cavern generated instant excitement among Horgan, Stevens and the other people at camp. But those first images were blurry, leaving people unsure of what the orange, bumblebee-sized critters actually were.</p>



<p>Workers next lowered an instrument down the borehole to measure the water temperature and salinity inside the cavern. They found the top 50 meters of water colder and fresher than what lay below — confirming that seawater was flowing in along the bottom and a more buoyant mixture of saltwater and freshwater was flowing out along the top. The cavern, says Stevens, “is operating quite like an estuary.”</p>



<p>But those measurements also presented a mystery: The water in the top of the cavern was only about 1 percent less salty than the seawater in its bottom, suggesting that the amount of freshwater flowing in through the river was “quite small,” says Stevens. It’s akin to a shallow creek that a young kid might splash around in. He and Horgan doubted that the turbulence caused by this small flow, even over 35&nbsp;years, could melt the entire cavern — roughly a cubic kilometer of ice.</p>



<p>A likely answer came from a set of samples collected from the floor of the cavern. Gavin Dunbar, a sedimentologist at the Victoria University of Wellington, lowered a hollow plastic cylinder down the hole in hopes of retrieving a core. As he and graduate student Linda Balfoort hoisted the cylinder back up, they found it streaked and filled with chocolaty mud — a strange sight in this world of pure white, where not a speck of rock or dirt can be seen for hundreds of kilometers.</p>



<p>As Dunbar and Balfoort X-rayed and analyzed the cores months later, back in New Zealand, their peculiarities became obvious: They were unlike anything that Dunbar had ever encountered in this part of the world.</p>



<p>Every core that Dunbar had ever seen from the seafloors near this part of Antarctica consisted of a chaotic jumble of sand, silt and gravel — a material called diamict, formed as the ice sheet advances and retreats over the seafloor, plowing and mixing it like a rototiller. But in these cores, Dunbar and Balfoort saw distinct layers. Bands of coarse, gravely material were interspersed with layers of fine, silty mud.</p>



<p>That alternating pattern resembled samples from steep seafloor canyons off the coast of New Zealand, where earthquakes sometimes trigger underwater landslides that sweep for many kilometers downhill. Each flood deposits a single layer of chunky material.</p>



<p>Dunbar believes that something similar happened under the Kamb Ice Stream, possibly in the last few decades. A series of fast-moving torrents gushed through the river channel carrying big gravelly chunks from somewhere upstream that later settled on the cavern floor. “Each of these [coarse layers] represents minutes to hours of sediment deposition” that occurred during a single flood, he says. And the fine, silty layers would have been laid down over years or decades in between the floods, when the river flowed languidly along.</p>



<p>These subglacial floods could explain how this small river carved such a large cavern, Stevens says. Those floods could have been 100 to 1,000 times as large as the flow rates that were measured during the 2021–22 field season.</p>



<p>No one knows when those events happened, but scientists using satellites to study subglacial lakes have <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/10/2971/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted at least one candidate</a>. In 2013, a lake 20 kilometers upstream from the cavern, called KT3, disgorged an estimated 60 million cubic meters of water — enough to fill 24,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p>



<p>Scientists would love to know whether that flood actually passed through this cavern. “Connecting this upstream to the lake system would be extremely cool,” says Matthew Siegfried, a glaciologist at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, who coauthored one of the reports documenting the 2013 flood.</p>



<p>Studying the outflow of this river could also answer other questions about the subglacial landscape upstream. “The vast majority of our knowledge of subglacial lakes comes from surface observations from space,” Siegfried says. But those satellite records, of ice bobbing up and down, permit only indirect estimates of how much water is flowing through. It’s possible, for example, that a lot of water passes through the lakes even when the ice above isn’t moving.</p>



<p>Scientists could also learn about the subglacial landscape by studying the sediment washed downstream. When Dunbar and his colleagues examined the coarse material from their cores, they found it full of microscopic fossils: glassy shells of marine diatoms, needly spicules of sea sponges, and notched and spiky pollen grains of southern beech trees. These fossils represent the remains of a warmer world, 15 million to 20 million years ago, when a few stands of stunted, shrubby trees still clung to parts of Antarctica. Back then, the West Antarctic basin held a sea rather than an ice sheet, and this detritus settled on its muddy bottom. These old marine deposits underlie much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and the few boreholes drilled so far suggest that the mix of fossils differs from one place to another. Those mixes could provide clues to how the flow of rivers changes over time.</p>



<p>To uncover the nuance of what’s happening in the cavern “is mind-blowingly cool,” says Christina Hulbe, a glaciologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who has studied this region of Antarctica for nearly 30 years. “That’s the outlet for a massively big river system, if you think about it.”</p>



<p>By studying the water, scientists could estimate the amount of organic carbon and other nutrients flowing out of the river into the ice-covered ocean. The landscape beneath the ice sheet appears to be rich in nutrients that might sustain oases of life in an otherwise famished biological desert.</p>



<h4>Scientists unveil an oasis of life</h4>



<p>Even as the cavern penetrates farther into the Kamb Ice Stream, it does not necessarily threaten the glacier’s stability. This part of the West Antarctic coastline is not considered vulnerable, because its shallow bed shields it from the deep, warm ocean currents that are causing rapid ice loss in other regions. But subglacial rivers pour out at many other points along the coastline, including some — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/melting-eroding-thwaites-glacier">like Thwaites Glacier</a>, roughly 1,100&nbsp;kilometers northeast of Kamb — where the ice is retreating rapidly (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Thwaites and nearby glaciers <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL082182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have collectively shed over 2,000&nbsp;cubic kilometers of ice</a> since 1992. They could eventually raise global sea levels by 2.3 meters if they collapse. Remote sensing studies <a href="https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/10.1144/sp461.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have documented over a dozen low, squat shield volcanoes</a> beneath this part of the ice sheet. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00242-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevated geothermal heat flow</a>, even from inactive volcanoes, is thought to cause high levels of melting under the ice sheet. That melting produces large amounts of subglacial water, which could render these glaciers even more vulnerable to human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>Horgan believes that what scientists learn at Kamb could improve our understanding of how subglacial rivers impact those other, rapidly changing coastlines of Antarctica.</p>



<p>But the most evocative discovery made at Kamb — in purely human terms — may be the blurry, orangish animals seen swarming near the bottom of the cavern. Stevens captured some clearer images a few days later and tentatively identified them as shrimp­like marine crustaceans called amphipods. To see so many of them here, Stevens says, “we really hadn’t expected that.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Video from a camera lowered into a hidden cavern beneath the Kamb Ice Stream showed animals, perhaps amphipods, swimming about. They may subsist in part on nutrients transported by a subglacial river.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Microbes like those previously found under the ice sheet in Subglacial Lake Whillans are known to eke out a living even in harsh conditions. But animals are a different matter. The deepest seafloors on Earth sit only 10 or 11 kilometers from sunlight, and animal life in those places is generally scarce. But the animals in the cavern are thriving 500 kilometers from the nearest daylight, cut off from the photosynthesis that fuels most life on Earth.</p>



<p>The amphipods and their supporting ecosystem must be subsisting on some other food source. But what? Observations in the Kamb ice cavern, combined with those at two other remote boreholes drilled in recent years, offer some tantalizing hints.</p>



<p>In 2015, researchers pierced the ice at another site 250 kilometers from the cavern, where the Whillans Ice Stream lifts off its bed and floats. In that location, a thin sliver of seawater, just 10&nbsp;meters deep, sits beneath 760 meters of ice. A remotely operated vehicle, or ROV, sent down the hole captured images of fish and amphipods.</p>



<p>John Priscu, a microbial ecologist at Montana State University in Bozeman who was involved in the drilling at the site, believes that the glacier itself is sustaining this ecosystem. The bottom 10&nbsp;meters of ice is packed with mud that had frozen onto the belly of the glacier many kilometers upstream. The mud had been dragged to its present location as the glacier oozed forward, 400&nbsp;meters per year. As the ROV navigated about, bits of that muddy debris constantly rained down, released as the ice’s underside slowly melted. That debris is rich in organic matter — the rotting remains of diatoms and other phytoplankton that sank to the bottom millions of years ago when the world was warmer.</p>



<p>“Those amphipods are swarming to the particulate matter,” Priscu says. “They’re sensing the organic matter falling out of that basal ice.” Or perhaps they may be eating the bacteria that live on those organics.</p>



<p>Because the Kamb Ice Stream is barely moving, the supply of dirty ice moving toward the sea is small. But the river flowing into the ice cavern may deliver the same subglacial nutrients that are found in dirty ice. After all, the water’s journey through a series of subglacial lakes down to the river’s mouth may take years or decades. Throughout that time, the river absorbs nutrients from the organic-rich subglacial sediments.</p>



<p>Indeed, when scientists drilled into Subglacial Lake Whillans in 2013, they found its water honey-colored — chock-full of life-sustaining iron, ammonium and organics. “What these lakes are pumping out may be a concentrated source of nutrients” for ecosystems along the dark coastline, says Trista Vick-Majors, a microbial ecologist at Michigan Technological University in Houghton who was involved in the drilling at Lake Whillans. She <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GB006446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has estimated that</a> the subglacial rivers flowing out from under Kamb and its neighboring glaciers may deliver 56,000&nbsp;tons of organic carbon and other nutrients to this section of the coastline every year.</p>



<p>More recently, in December 2019, a team from New Zealand led by Horgan and Hulbe drilled through the ice just 50 kilometers from the Kamb cavern, in a place where the Kamb Ice Stream floats on the ocean. There’s no dirty ice there and no nearby river outlets. The area resembled a famished seafloor desert; it was populated by single-celled microbes with little to eat, and few signs of animals were seen — only a few burrowing traces on the muddy bottom. Priscu sees this location as an exception that proves the point: Subglacial nutrients are the crucial energy source in this dark world under the floating ice, whether they are dragged forward on the undersides of glaciers or spilled out through subglacial rivers.</p>



<p>The mud and water samples collected from the Kamb ice cavern may provide a new opportunity to test that theory. Craig Cary, a microbial ecologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, is analyzing DNA from those samples. He hopes to determine whether the microbes in the cavern belong to taxonomic groups that are known to subsist on ammonium, methane, hydrogen or other sources of chemical energy that originate from the subglacial sediments. That might reveal whether such sources support enough microbial growth to feed the animals observed there.</p>



<p>The team also needs to measure the flow rate of the subglacial river that spills into the cavern, since that determines the nutrient supply. Stevens continues to monitor this thanks to a set of instruments left behind in the cavern.</p>

STEVENS/NIWA</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As people were packing up camp on January 11, 2022, workers pumped more hot water into the borehole, widening it to more than 35 centimeters — and creating a dangerous pitfall. Stevens and his colleagues donned climbing harnesses, clipped into safety ropes and approached the hole one last time. They lowered a series of cylinders the size of caulking guns down the hole. These devices continue to measure the temperature, salinity and water currents inside the cavern, sending the data 500 meters up a cable to a transmitter that beams it home via satellite once a day. That data will reveal how the river’s flow changes over time. With luck, the instruments might even detect a subglacial flood gushing through.</p>



<p>“That would just be outstanding,” Horgan says. For many years, he had to content himself with seeing these rivers and lakes dimly, through the outlines of water on radar and satellite images. This is “one of the first times we’ve got to stand at a river mouth and observe it.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">For much of the past year, we and several colleagues in our field have been trying to convince a publisher to retract a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jwi.org/calendar/challenging-parental-alienation">Advocates are using</a> the text because it contains details on how to advance numerous laws in the United States and throughout the world. The text is also currently being <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/library/publications/questioning-scientific-validity-parental-alienation-label-abuse-cases">used to influence judicial decisions</a> that affect the lives of thousands of families.</p>



<p>The problem is, the work contains a massive amount of misinformation, misquoted sources, plagiarized text, and many other flaws.</p>



<p>We have been so disappointed with the failure of the publisher and the Committee on Publishing Ethics (COPE) to address our concerns and our request for retraction that we have decided to share our experience with the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126939"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On December 3, 2021, Routledge, part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group,&nbsp; published <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Challenging-Parental-Alienation-New-Directions-for-Professionals-and-Parents/Mercer-Drew/p/book/9780367559762"><em>Challenging Parental Alienation: New Directions for Professionals and Parents</em></a><em>, </em>which was edited by Jean Mercer and Margaret Drew. All of the chapter authors in the book have been staunch critics of parental alienation (PA) research and theory, the study of children who, as one of us (JJH) has written, are influenced by a parental figure to reject their other parent for reasons that are exaggerated or not legitimate during and after a divorce. The field has a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0001404">strong scientific basis</a>. Our group, comprised of scientists and practitioners working in the field of PA, purchased the book with the intent of writing a book review for a peer-reviewed journal.</p>



<p>We soon identified a pervasive amount of mis/disinformation about PA, overstated and distorted facts, mischaracterization of extant research, use of secondary and tertiary citations (and nonexistent ones), strawman arguments, and other techniques of science denial across all chapters of the book.</p>



<p>The problems were so extensive, we decided to write a thorough critique of the larger issues and submit a request to the publisher to retract the text from circulation, recall existing physical and digital copies, and issue a public statement that this action was taken. <a href="https://pasg.info/app/uploads/2023/04/Analysis-of-Mercer-Drew-2023-04-04.pdf">The critique and request for retraction</a> was endorsed by 45 organizations studying and working with families affected by PA.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Our organizations – the <a href="http://www.pasg.info">Parental Alienation Study Group</a> and the <a href="https://garipa.org/">Global Action for Research Integrity in Parental Alienation</a> – submitted our critique to Claire Jarvis, senior editor for health and social care at Routledge, and Jeremy North, managing director of books at Taylor &amp; Francis, on August 12, 2022.&nbsp; We also attached a letter that included the following statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is not simply a difference of opinions among professionals with contrasting perspectives on a controversial topic. Rather, our critique centers on factual errors such as distortions of the writings and opinions of other scholars.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Two weeks later, Jarvis responded by stating that the original proposal for the book “was externally reviewed by experts in the field and received two supportive endorsements. Although we appreciate that the field is a contested one, we are happy with the book’s content and will not be withdrawing it from sale.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Realizing that Jarvis and North were not going to address our concerns, we contacted COPE on August 28, 2022. We asked specifically for help obtaining information about the procedures followed by the publisher to reach their decision to publish the book, and to gain assistance facilitating communication and resolution with Routledge. We were informed by Alysa Levine, operations manager at COPE, that we were required to refrain from posting anything about the case while it was under review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A week later, Iratxe Puebla, facilitation and integrity officer at COPE, emailed Jarvis and Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics and integrity at<strong> </strong>Taylor &amp; Francis. Her email stated that COPE’s role was to provide guidance on whether any procedures were followed, or actions taken that were inconsistent with COPE practices or guidelines. She wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Bernet has raised concerns that the book mentioned contains errors and inaccuracies about parental alienation. Dr. Bernet considers that the publisher should consult independent experts in assessing his concerns and withdraw the book from publication. We include below a summary of the concerns raised by Dr. Bernet.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Puelba asked Jarvis and Alam about the review process for the book, and how the publisher and its employees handled concerns about the work. She asked for an update on the current status of the follow-up with us, and whether a resolution had been reached regarding the concerns about the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In mid-September, Jarvis briefly responded to Puebla and Bernet with the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have further discussed this concern with our editorial and publishing directors. They asked me to reiterate the first reply we gave to you which was that we are happy with the reviews we obtained for this project and also with the academic credentials of both editors. Because of this, we will not be withdrawing this book from sale.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Immediately after receiving this message, Bernet responded by pointing out that there still appeared to be no attempt to investigate the concerns we raised about the book, that we had no information about who specifically conducted the reviews of the project or how the reviewers were selected, and that she did not seem to be aware the book’s chapter authors have spent years <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15379418.2018.1557578">publishing derogatory comments and falsehoods about PA</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On September 16, 2022, Puebla emailed to notify us that she had raised our correspondence with Jarvis to the attention of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee at COPE, who would review the matter. She said she would be in touch in “due course.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the next 3 months, Puebla repeatedly asked Jarvis to provide a response to the issues raised in her initial email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jarvis did not respond to any of the requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After Jarvis and her colleagues at Routledge and Taylor &amp; Francis ignored the third deadline that COPE imposed on them, we emailed Puebla on November 28.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time, we brought to her attention a <a href="https://drpeterwilmshurst.wordpress.com/2022/11/15/has-cope-membership-become-a-way-for-unprincipled-journals-to-buy-a-fake-badge-of-integrity/">blog</a> recently posted by Peter Wilmshurst, a cardiologist and whistleblower. In it, Wilmshurst asked, “Has COPE membership become a way for unprincipled journals to buy a fake badge of integrity?”&nbsp;His point was that COPE may be unable or unwilling to sanction large publishers because COPE needs the funds these publishers pay as membership dues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taylor &amp; Francis is a <a href="https://publicationethics.org/category/publisher/taylor-and-francis">member of COPE</a>, and presumably a substantial payer of <a href="https://publicationethics.org/cope-membership-subscription-fees#PublisherJournal">dues</a>.&nbsp;We explicitly asked whether there was any hope that Puebla’s office could help us resolve our disagreement with Taylor &amp; Francis. If COPE was powerless to help sort this out, we needed to know so that we could proceed with another approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day later, Puebla replied stating she raised the email to the attention of relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After receiving no additional response, we again emailed Puebla on December 16, reviewing the chain of events described above. We asked, again, what the next step was—if any. Her response:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This matter is under discussion by relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee. I should note that the COPE office will be closed for a good part of the next two weeks and thus, we may only be able to provide a further update in January.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On January 1, 2023, we emailed Puebla again, this time with information about a new peer-reviewed paper published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bsl.2605"><em>Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law</em></a><em>. </em>The article detailed vast misinformation about PA that has been published and then republished since 1994. We pointed out that four chapters from <em>Challenging Parental Alienation </em>contained this misinformation, something our critique cited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our point was that the errors we identified in the book were not random or accidental. Rather, they represent a larger campaign by the editors and authors of the book to discredit PA research and theory. The chapter authors in the book have made the same false statements in other journal articles, book chapters, formal presentations, and government documents. The conveying of disinformation needs to be interrupted, and that is why we were seeking retraction. We asked again what the next steps are and wrote that it seemed Routledge’s membership in COPE should be suspended for failure to respond to COPE’s inquiries.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Exactly one month later, after receiving no response from Puebla, we emailed her again. We provided an outline of our correspondence regarding the matter since August 12, 2022. We informed her that during the time of this inquiry process, the editors of <em>Challenging Parental Alienation</em> have been promoting the book through book reviews in journals, websites, and government documents in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We again asked her for suggestions on how to resolve our dispute with the publishers, whether they had given up all discussion and negotiations with them, and whether COPE was ready to recommend suspending Routledge’s membership for failure to comply with COPE’s basic expectations regarding the resolution of serious complaints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, we asked whether she was ready to proceed with the next step in COPE’s flow chart of processes for handling this type of problem, which was that the Subcommittee member and Facilitation and Integrity Officer would review all correspondence and draft a report. We also asked whether we could start to share our concerns on social media and other outlets.</p>



<p>On February 4, Puebla responded to say that she, again, had raised the correspondence to the attention of relevant members of the Facilitation and Integrity Subcommittee and would be in touch as they provided advice. This is the last communication we have had with COPE.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><strong></strong>Ironically, Routledge has published several books that present PA theory in a responsible, positive manner. But now they have published an extremely negative book replete with misinformation that directly contradicts their previous books on the topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We remain concerned that the publisher has refused to retract a book with obviously false and misleading material—which we believe is likely to damage children and families in many countries—and that COPE seems powerless to intervene.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/04/20/how-can-a-neural-network-be-like-the-brain/">How can a neural network be like the brain?</a></h4>

              
                <p>NeuroAI is the budding research field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. One of the core concepts used in the field is that artificial neural networks can act as good models of the brain. For example, it’s often claimed that convolutional neural networks can account for the response of the ventral visual stream to images. Similarly, large language models have been found that capture what’s going on inside the language network of the brain. When I have discussions with people outside of our narrow field, this often triggers surprise. Wait, how can a deep neural network be like the brain? What does it mean to be a good model? How can the squishy stuff be like the silicon?</p>



<p>Here I want to get into the specifics of how, mechanically, you compare a brain to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). I give some historical background first, focusing on classic results and methods that originated in the field of visual perception. I will explain the nitty gritty of how correspondence scores between brains and ANNs are calculated. I discuss some of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the classic methods of linear regression and RSA, and explain some of the proposed alternative metrics in Williams et al. (2021). You’ll get the most out of these sections if you’re coming from a math background: statistician, data scientist, computational neuroscientist, etc. Nevertheless, if you’re less math-oriented, I will give intuitive explanations so you can follow along. I conclude with a call to create and use more nuanced and detailed comparisons between brains and neural nets.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">History: the visual ventral stream as a convolutional neural net</h1>



<p>Let’s start with the classic example of convolutional neural networks vs. the ventral visual stream. In the late 80’s, Yann LeCun was inspired by the classic work of Hubel and Wiesel on the physiology of the visual cortex. He created a neural network consisting of sandwiched layers of selectivity and invariance operations, not unlike the simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex. His network, LeNet, was the first example of a convolutional neural net (CNN) trained with gradient descent, and it could classify handwritten digits. Two decades later, this work was then greatly scaled up by Alex Krizhevsky and co. in Geoff Hinton’s lab at the University of Toronto. AlexNet led to the ImageNet moment, in 2012, where a CNN did far better than state-of-the-art classical machine learning methods at image classification, showing that “deep learning has arrived”.</p>



<p>If CNNs were inspired by the brain, and they do the same thing as a brain (image classification), could they be a little like the brain? If it talks like a duck, and it walks like a duck, is it a duck? This is a surprisingly subtle question, and two teams (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1403112111">Dan Yamins in Jim DiCarlo’s</a> lab, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003915">Khaligh-Razavi in Niko Kriegeskorte’s</a>) answered this question with a vigorous “yes, maybe!?” in 2014. They looked at the responses of the ventral visual stream—areas of the brain traditionally associated with shape perception and image classification—and compared them against the ANNs of the time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The mechanics of comparing a brain to an ANN</h2>



<p>So how did they compare a brain to an ANN? They followed what’s now considered a classic recipe. You need three inputs:</p>



<ol>
<li>an ANN trained for some task (e.g. visual classification)</li>



<li>a brain (human or non-human)</li>



<li>a set of benchmark stimuli (e.g. a set of images, sentences, videos, etc.)</li>
</ol>



<p>You then proceed as follows:</p>



<ol>
<li>You probe the ANN with all the benchmark stimuli. You obtain a matrix of responses <strong>X</strong>. Each row is one stimulus (=one image, one movie clip, one sentence, etc.). Each column corresponds to a subunit of the neural network (e.g. the collected intermediate activations of the ANN).</li>



<li>You do the same with the brain. That means, for instance, having someone sit inside the scanner, looking at the same set of images that the neural network was exposed to, and you recording their functional responses. You collect the data into a new matrix. The rows are again exemplars, but now the columns represent something else: physical neurons, EEG sensors, fMRI voxels, etc. This gives us a matrix of responses <strong>Y</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>By construction, <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> have the same number of rows, but different column counts. We’ve thus reduced the problem of comparing a brain and an ANN to the problem of comparing two matrices of different shapes.</p>



<p>There are two now classic ways of doing this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Linear regression: Do multiple linear regression to map one matrix onto the other. Learn a weight matrix <strong>W</strong> such that the residual ||<strong>Y</strong> &#8211; <strong>XW</strong>|| is minimized. This requires some regularization: Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes the sum-of-squares of <strong>W</strong>, might help here. An alternative is to require that the mapping is low-rank using partial least-squares with a limited number of components. This is the path used by Yamins &amp; DiCarlo. The final score is the R2 of the linear regression, perhaps calculated through cross-validation (CV).</li>



<li>Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA): One difficulty with the previous method is that it requires learning a weight vector <strong>W</strong>. This is necessary, in part because the dimensionality of the two matrices might be different. If we form the matrices <strong>XX</strong>’ and <strong>YY</strong>’, however, we obtain two square matrices of the same size. Furthermore, these matrices are invariant to a relabeling (permutation) of the columns. Thus, we can compare the elements of the two similarity matrices via a correlation coefficient. Technically, you could have a negative score, but you could threshold or square to get a score in the 0-1 range. This <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full">is the method pioneered by Niko Kriegeskorte back in 2008</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>These procedures will result in two distinct scores for the similarity of matrices: the linear regression score (really, CV R2) and the RSA score. Both have the property that 0 is maximally misaligned and 1 is maximally aligned. This way, we have reduced the difficult philosophical question of what it means for a brain to be like an ANN to a problem of <em>big number good, small number bad.</em></p>

<p>Using these tools, the two historical papers came to similar conclusions: deep neural nets trained on images have similar representations to the ventral visual stream of the brain. For the Yamins paper, it was with linear regression and with single-cell neurophysiology; for Khaligh-Razavi, it was RSA on fMRI data.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conceptual difficulties with comparing brains and ANNs</strong></h1>



<p>Procedures to map brains to ANNs like linear regression and RSA swap out deep philosophical issues about the nature of perception with a technocratic procedure. In fact, there’s a lot that hides under these scoring procedures.</p>



<p>Both methods are <em>correct</em> at the extremes: if you try to compare two random matrices against each other, you’ll get a score of 0; and if you compare a brain (or an ANN) against itself, you’ll get a score of 1. So a brain is similar to itself but not to random noise: cool. That’s a pretty low bar to achieve, and it’s in the middle scores that we run into conceptual difficulties. What does a 0.5 similarity between the brain and an ANN mean? What are we actually trying to quantify?</p>

Or is it a different one?</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>There are different ways in which we can conceptualize how the brain can be like an ANN. Let’s name some of these ways:</p>



<ol>
<li>We could ask for a 1-to-1 correspondence: each subunit in the ANN should correspond to a neuron in the brain. That’s a very high bar to clear! Let’s call this 1-to-1 correspondence.</li>



<li>We could ask that distances are preserved in the brain and in the ANN. An analogy in 3d will help. Two three-dimensional shapes (say, rubber duckies, above) can be similar, regardless of their (arbitrary) orientation. Distances between two points on the surface of the duckies are preserved: they are invariants. Let’s call this orthogonal correspondence.</li>



<li>We could ask that one manifold of responses can be morphed into another through a linear transformation. Let’s call this linear correspondence.</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s not clear how traditional linear regression and RSA scores map to these desiderata. You can make a verbal argument that linear regression is similar to linear correspondence (2), while RSA is most similar to orthogonal correspondence (2). However, there are complications in real implementations: regularization in linear regression, selection of voxels with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio in RSA. This means that we might not capture our (unstated) goals in complex ways.</p>



<p>Traditionally, these concerns have been more or less swept under the rug, and each subfield has converged on its own widely agreed-upon scores: RSA for human neuroscience, linear regression for single-cell neurophysiology. The argument goes that whatever score we choose, alternative scores would correlate with it. This encourages papers from using whatever is the most commonly used score in their subfield, which allows the scores to be compared more readily from paper to paper. A perfectly reasonable heuristic, but a little unsatisfying.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Williams et al.&#8217;s solution: computational shape analysis</strong></h1>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14739">Williams et al. (2021)</a> offer a nice treatment of these issues with some good conceptual solutions, casting the problem as one of computational shape analysis: analyzing shapes in high-dimensional spaces with statistical tools.</p>

<p>First, they project the two representations (brain and ANN) onto a fixed, common-sized representation. You could use random projections, subsampling, PCA, etc. to get two matrices with different widths to the same width.

Some potential choices:</p>



<ol>
<li>If you want one-to-one correspondence between the brain and ANN, <em>G</em> can be the set of all permutation matrices</li>



<li>If you want distances to be preserved, then <em>G</em> can be the orthonormal matrices</li>



<li>If you want to allow squishing along arbitrary linear dimensions, you can let <em>G</em> be arbitrary linear transformations</li>
</ol>



<p>It turns out the resulting scores are proper distances that respect the triangle inequality, which has some nice benefits for clustering. They also introduce more metrics for more unusual scenarios. For example, for convolutional neural networks, you’d want something that allows remapping along the channel dimension, but not along the space dimension. Although each metric seems like it requires a brute-force search, it turns out there are clever ways of calculating the optimal transformations in each scenario.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The advantage of axiomatic methods</h1>



<p>Overall, Williams et al. take cues from the recent success of geometric deep learning (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478">Bronstein et al. 2021</a>) to ask deep questions about the metrics we use. More than just an incremental numerical improvement, I think it’s a big conceptual improvement over linear regression and RSA: you know what you’re getting into. An axiomatic approach tells you very explicitly what the underlying assumptions are.</p>



<p>Ironically, this makes it easier to poke holes in some of these scores. For instance, one of the core desiderata that Williams et al. fulfill is that their chosen score should be symmetric. Now, I would argue that a brain can be more similar to a neural network than vice-versa. Modern large language models (LLMs) represent more stuff than humans: GPT-4 knows markdown, latex, English, German, how to write listicles and poems and sound like a pirate. Most people can only do a subset of these things. Divergences for distributions are naturally asymmetric, so there’s nothing inherently fishy about a score that is asymmetric. I’m sure there is a variant of linear regression’s asymmetric R2 which can be properly axiomatized according to the framework laid out by Williams et al.</p>



<p>In the meantime, one can use combinations of these well-justified metrics to answer interesting questions about how brains vs. ANNs represent information. For example, the delta between linear correspondance (metric 3) and the orthogonal correspondance (metric 2) is an index about how much warping is necessary to get two latent spaces to match. This could help reveal whether a brain’s representation is <em>a subset of</em> or <em>a noisy approximation of</em> a particular artificial neural net, which is ambiguous for each individual metric. Williams et al. have made their metrics available in <a href="https://github.com/ahwillia/netrep">this Python package</a>, so you can try this out yourself.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Discussion</h1>



<p>For all their justification, we haven’t seen much empirical work using well-axiomatized scores beyond linear regression and RSA. I think the reason for the status quo is that we’ve been focused on coarse characterizations thus far. This will surely need to change as we go beyond <em>ANNs as metaphors for the brain</em> and start using them as <em>in silico models</em> of the brain.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://xcorr.net/2022/05/18/whats-the-endgame-of-neuroai/">I’m interested in using ANNs as models for the brain for the purpose of neural engineering</a>. What I really want is that when I create a virtual lesion in a neural network, it predicts how the real brain will react to a real lesion. Such a <em>causal manipulation score</em> doesn’t yet exist, but I think it would be both conceptually and practically useful. The axiomatic approach of Williams et al. points us towards ways of building this type of score.</p>



<p>For other purposes, however, it may be that the metrics we have are good enough. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.16.537080v1">This recent paper from Tuckute et al.</a> shows that one can learn a transfer function between a large language model and the brain’s language network using linear regression. The model can predict which sentences drive or don’t drive the brain. Using in silico models to predict the response of the brain is helpful in this scenario, and in a certain meaningful sense it means that the brain <em>is like a neural network</em>, along this prediction axis, but perhaps not according to more stringent criteria.</p>



<p>The work from Williams et al. is just one of a number of recent approaches looking at this problem in depth. We’ve seen <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11665">some of the same authors extend this work to stochastic representations</a>. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2023/01/01/2022-in-review-neuroai-comes-of-age/">Furthermore, empiricists have pointed out problems that current metrics don’t capture</a>, for example, hierarchical correspondence. I think it’s an exciting time to think deeply about our metrics and what it really means for a brain to be like an ANN.</p>

                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, April 20 at 2pm Eastern</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; PLOS today announced that<em> PLOS Genetics </em>is expanding the scope of its journal with a renamed section called <em>Microbial Genetics. </em>This section will replace the former Prokaryotic Genetics section to emphasize research on microbes more broadly with the aim to publish studies that use genetic approaches to provide insights into how bacteria as well as archaea and their phages/viruses, fungi (including yeasts and filamentous fungi), and protists function and interact with the biotic and abiotic world.</p>



<p><em>PLOS Genetics</em> has an established presence in the fungal genetics community, but this research has not easily found a home within its existing journal sections. Currently, the majority of these submissions, primarily studies in yeast, are handled within the General section of the journal. The new microbial section will rectify that issue.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We believe the new <em>Microbial Genetics</em> section will provide a logical new home for these submissions and reaffirm our continued support for this type of research,&rdquo; said Gregory Copenhaver, Co Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are excited that the relaunch of this section will include a Curated Collection for malaria-related research, which will also include other protozoan parasites,&rdquo; said Gregory Barsh, Co Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Genetics.</em></p>



<p>The new section on Microbial Genetics will be headed by Geraldine Butler, Eva Stukenbrock, Lotte S&oslash;gaard-Andersen and Sean Crosson. These four section editors are supported by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/editorial-board">associate editors</a> with broad expertise in microbial genetics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jellyfish-nervous-system-animal">Comb jellies have a bizarre nervous system unlike any other animal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Shimmering, gelatinous comb jellies wouldn’t appear to have much to hide. But their mostly see-through bodies cloak <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade5645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a nervous system unlike that of any other known animal</a>, researchers report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>In the nervous systems of everything from anemones to aardvarks, electrical impulses pass between nerve cells, allowing for signals to move from one cell to the next. But the ctenophores’ cobweb of neurons, called a nerve net, is missing these distinct connection spots, or synapses. Instead, the nerve net is fused together, with long, stringy neurons sharing a cell membrane, a new 3-D map of its structure shows.</p>





<p>While the nerve net has been described before, no one had generated a high-resolution, detailed picture of it.</p>



<p>It’s possible the bizarre tissue represents a second, independent evolutionary origin of a nervous system, say Pawel Burkhardt, a comparative neurobiologist at the University of Bergen in Norway, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Superficially similar to jellyfish, ctenophores are often called comb jellies because they swim using rows of beating, hairlike combs. The enigmatic phylum is considered one of the earliest to branch off the animal tree of life. So ctenophores’ possession of a simple nervous system has been of particular interest to scientists interested in how such systems evolved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous genetics research had hinted at the strangeness of the ctenophore nervous system. For instance, a 2018 study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0575-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couldn’t find a cell type in ctenophores</a> with a genetic signature that corresponded to recognizable neurons, Burkhardt says.</p>



<p>Burkhardt, along with neurobiologist Maike Kittelmann of Oxford Brookes University in England and colleagues, examined young sea walnuts (<em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>) using electron microscopes, compiling many images to reconstruct the entire net structure. Their 3-D map of a 1-day-old sea walnut revealed the funky synapse-free fusion between the five sprawling neurons that made up the tiny ctenophore’s net.</p>

<p>The conventional view is that neurons and the rest of the nervous system evolved once in animal evolutionary history. But given this “unique architecture” and ctenophores’ ancient position in the animal kingdom, it raises the possibility that nerve cells actually evolved twice, Burkhardt says. “I think that&#8217;s exciting.”</p>





<p>But he adds that further work — especially on the development of these neurons — is needed to help verify their evolutionary origin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The origins of the animal nervous system is a murky area of research. Sponges — the traditional competitors for the title of most ancient animal — don’t have a nervous system, or muscles or fundamental vision proteins called opsins, for that matter.&nbsp;But there’s been mounting evidence to suggest that ctenophores are actually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-origins-shift-comb-jellies">the most ancient animal group</a>, older even than sponges (<em>SN: 12/12/13</em>).</p>



<p>If ctenophores arose first, it “implies that either sponges have lost a massive number of features, or that the ctenophores effectively evolved them all independently,” says Graham Budd, a paleobiologist at Uppsala University in Sweden who was not involved in the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If sponges emerged first, it’s still possible that ctenophores evolved their nerve net independently rather than inheriting it from a neuron-bearing ancestor, Burkhardt says. Ctenophores have other neurons outside the nerve net, such as mesogleal neurons embedded in a ctenophore’s gelatinous body layer and sensory cells, the latter of which may communicate with the nerve net to adjust the beating of the combs. So, it’s possible they’re a mosaic of two nervous systems of differing evolutionary origins.</p>



<p>But Joseph Ryan, a bioinformatician at the University of Florida in Gainesville, doesn’t think the results necessarily point to the parallel evolution of a nervous system. Given how long ctenophores have been around — especially if they are older than sponges — the ancestral nervous system may have had plenty of time to evolve into something weird and highly-specialized, says Ryan, who was not part of the study.&nbsp;“We&#8217;re dealing with close to a billion years of evolution. We&#8217;re going to expect strange things to happen.”</p>



<p>The findings are “one more bit of the jigsaw puzzle,” Budd says. “There&#8217;s a whole bunch we don&#8217;t know about these rather common and rather well-known animals.”</p>



<p>For instance, it’s unclear how the nerve net works. Our neurons use rapid changes in voltage across their cell membranes to send signals, but the nerve net might work quite differently, Burkhardt says.<br><br>There are reports of potentially similar systems in other animals, such as by-the-wind-sailor jellies (<em>Velella velella</em>). Studying them in detail, along with nerve nets in other ctenophore species, could determine just how unusual this synapse-less nervous system is.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/northern-elephant-seals-sleep-sea">Northern elephant seals sleep just two hours a day at sea</a></h4>

              
                <p>Northern elephant seals are the true masters of the power nap.</p>



<p>On long trips out to sea, the seals <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snooze less than 20 minutes at a time</a>, researchers report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>. The animals average just two hours of shut-eye per day while swimming offshore for months — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-elephants-clock-shortest-shut-eye-recorded-mammals">rivaling African elephants</a> for the least sleep measured among mammals (<em>SN: 3/1/17</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s important to map these extremes of [sleep behavior] across the animal kingdom to get a better sense of the evolution and the function of sleep for all mammals, including humans,” says Jessica Kendall-Bar, an ecophysiologist at the University of California, San Diego. Knowing how seals catch their z’s could also guide conservation efforts to protect places where they sleep.</p>





<p>Northern elephant seals (<em>Mirounga angustirostris</em>) spend most of the year out in the Pacific Ocean. On these odysseys, the animals forage around the clock for fish, squid and other food to sustain their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-seals-eating-males-huge-death-risk-survival">enormous bodies</a>, which can be as hefty as a car (<em>SN: 2/4/22</em>). Because northern elephant seals are most vulnerable to sharks and killer whales at the surface, they come up for air only a couple minutes at a time between 10- to 30-minute <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-whales-dolphins-seals-dive-so-deep">deep dives</a> (<em>SN: 9/28/02</em>).</p>



<p>“People had known that these seals dive almost all the time when they’re out in the ocean, but it wasn’t known if and how they sleep,” says Niels Rattenborg, a neurobiologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Seewiesen, Germany, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>To find out if the seals sleep while diving, Kendall-Bar and her colleagues developed a watertight EEG cap for the animals. Using the cap and other sensors, the team tracked the brain waves, heart rates and 3-D motion of 13 young female seals, including five at a lab and six hanging out at coastal Año Nuevo State Park north of Santa Cruz, Calif. EEG data recorded while seals were slumbering revealed what the animals’ naptime brain waves looked like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kendall-Bar’s team also took two sensor-strapped seals from Año Nuevo and released them at another beach about 60 kilometers south. To swim home, the seals had to cross the deep Monterey Canyon — a locale similar to the deep, predator-fraught waters frequented by seals on months-long foraging trips. Matching the seals’ EEG readings to their diving motions on this journey showed how northern elephant seals sleep on long voyages.</p>



<p>The animals first swim 60 to 100 meters below the surface, then relax into a glide, Kendall-Bar says. As they nod off into slow-wave sleep, the animals keep holding themselves upright for several minutes. But as REM sleep sets in, so does sleep paralysis. The animals flip upside-down and drift in gentle spirals toward the seafloor. Seals can descend hundreds of meters deep during these naps — far below where their predators normally prowl. When the seals wake after five to 10 minutes of sleep, they swim up to the surface. The whole routine takes about 20 minutes.</p>



<p>Looking for that distinct sleep dive motion, the researchers could pick out naps in the dive records of 334 adult seals that had been outfitted with tracking tags from 2004 to 2019. Those sleep patterns revealed that northern elephant seals conk out, on average, around two hours per day while on months-long foraging missions. But the seals sleep nearly 11 hours per day while on land to mate and molt, where they can indulge in long, beachside siestas without worrying about predators.</p>

<p>“What the seals are doing might be something like what we do when we sleep in on the weekend, but it’s on a much longer timescale,” Rattenborg says. He and his colleagues have found a similar feast-and-famine style of sleep in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frigate-birds-fly-nonstop-months">great frigate birds</a>, which fly over the ocean (<em>SN: 6/30/16</em>). “Although they can sleep while they’re flying,” he says, “they sleep less than an hour a day for up to a week at a time, and once back on land, they sleep over 12 hours a day.”</p>



<p>Curiously, northern elephant seals’ sleep habits are quite different from how other marine mammals have been seen sleeping in labs. “Many of them … sleep in just half of their brain at a time,” Kendall-Bar says. That half-awake state allows dolphins, fur seals and sea lions to practice constant vigilance, literally sleeping with one eye open.</p>





<p>“I think it’s pretty cool that elephant seals are doing this without [one-sided] sleep,” Kendall-Bar says. “They’re shutting off both halves of their brain completely and leaving themselves vulnerable.” It seems the key to enjoying such deep sleep is sleeping deep in the sea.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-antimatter-origins-fermi-bubbles-galaxy">Cosmic antimatter hints at origins of huge bubbles in our galaxy’s center</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS </strong>— Bubbles of radiation billowing from the galactic center may have started as a stream of electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons, new observations suggest. An excess of positrons zipping past Earth suggests that the bubbles are the result of a burp from our galaxy’s supermassive black hole after a meal millions of years ago.</p>



<p>For over a decade, scientists have known about bubbles of gas, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-ways-black-hole-may-blow-bubbles">Fermi bubbles</a>, extending above and below the Milky Way’s center (<em>SN: 11/9/10</em>). Other observations have since spotted the bubbles in microwave radiation and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/x-ray-bubbles-center-milky-way-galaxy">X-rays</a> (<em>SN: 12/9/20</em>). But astronomers still aren’t quite sure how they formed.</p>





<p>A jet of high-energy electrons and positrons, <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/U13.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emitted by the supermassive black hole in one big burst</a>, could explain the bubbles’ multi-wavelength light, physicist Ilias Cholis reported April 18 at the American Physical Society meeting.</p>



<p>In the initial burst, most of the particles would have been launched along jets aimed perpendicular to the galaxy’s disk. As the particles interacted with other galactic matter, they would lose energy and cause the emission of different wavelengths of light.</p>



<p>Those jets would have been aimed away from Earth, so those particles can never be detected. But some of the particles could have escaped along the galactic disk, perpendicular to the bubbles, and end up passing Earth. “It could be that just now, some of those positrons are hitting us,” says Cholis, of Oakland University in Rochester, Mich.</p>



<p>So Cholis and Iason Krommydas of Rice University in Houston analyzed positrons detected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station. The pair found an excess of positrons whose present-day energies could correspond to a burst of activity from the galactic center between 3 million and 10 million years ago, right around when the Fermi bubbles are thought to have formed, Cholis said at the meeting.</p>



<p>The result, Cholis said, supports the idea that the Fermi bubbles came from a time when the galaxy’s central black hole was busier than it is today.</p>

<p>The global sigh of relief was almost audible when a study last year found kids who played video games for hours every day had no worse mental health than non-gamers. In fact, they came out ahead on some cognitive measures.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/generalpediatrics/101377">Video Games May Not Rot Kids&#8217; Brains After All</a>,” one of the <a href="https://jamanetwork.altmetric.com/details/137629755/news/page:1">many news stories</a> about the research trumpeted. Another headline declared: &#8220;<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20221024-video-games-could-improve-kids-brains-study">Video games could improve kids&#8217; brains.</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>Now it turns out the study, titled “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797596">Association of Video Gaming With Cognitive Performance Among Children</a>,” was so flawed it had to be retracted and republished. The updated results show gamers did actually score significantly worse on things like attention and depression, although some of their performance metrics were still slightly better than among non-gamers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797596">republished article</a> in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>:</p>



<span id="more-126935"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Video gaming may be associated with small but improved cognitive abilities involving response inhibition and working memory and with alterations in underlying cortical pathways, but concerns about the association with mental health may warrant further study.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The study <a href="https://jamanetwork.altmetric.com/details/137629755/news/page:1">made headlines across the globe</a>, but has been cited just twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies about the effects of video games are often contentious, as we&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xb89b/two-researchers-challenged-a-scientific-study-about-violent-video-gamesand-took-a-hit-for-being-right">reported before</a>, and this one appears no different. According to the April 10 letter to the editor that serves as the study’s<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2803642"> notice of retraction and replacement</a>, a reader informed the authors of several errors in their work, which caused them to make extensive corrections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter offers a detailed explanation of five key errors, many of which stem from a failure to include, properly account for, and analyze differences between the study’s two groups. There were also errors in the way the study presented data and results, for instance results related to how children performed on two cognitive tests. While the original study found that the children who played video games did better at both tests, a reanalysis showed that they did notably worse on one test and about the same on another compared to children who didn’t play video games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even after the corrections, the authors note that children who played video games still performed slightly better on the study’s motor and memory tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the revised abstract notes that “the Child Behavior Checklist behavioral and mental health scores were higher in VGs , with attention problems, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder scores significantly higher in the VGs compared with the NVGs [non-video gamers].” This contrasts with the original study, which claimed that these scores “were not significantly different” between the groups.</p>



<p>Bader Chaarani, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont, told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As you may have noticed, our main findings and conclusions in the updated version of the article remain unchanged. The most relevant correction is that some of the mental health scores are found to be significantly higher in videogamers, whereas in the original version we stated that mental scores were higher in videogamers without reaching statistical difference. However, these scores remain far from clinical significance. The errors occurred mostly in the table of demographics, mainly because some of the co-authors involved in the analyses used inconsistent lists of participants.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Chaarani nor any of the paper’s other authors have had any previous papers retracted, according to Retraction Watch’s<a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dBader%2bChaarani"> database</a>.</p>



<p>Annette Flanagin, executive managing editor of<em> JAMA</em> and <em>JAMA Network</em>, told us:</p>



<p><em>As the authors report, a reader reported concerns that prompted the authors to identify and correct errors in their analyses and findings. This is the</em><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2652632"><em> standard process</em></a><em> for such errors that, when corrected, result in changes in some findings and the study is considered valid. The authors provide detailed explanations in their Letter, which is published as a notice of retraction and replacement.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urchins-dying-off-caribbean-disease">Urchins are dying off across the Caribbean. Scientists now know why</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since early 2022, sea urchins have been mysteriously dying off across the Caribbean. Now scientists say they have identified the main culprit: a type of relatively large, single-celled marine microorganism called a scuticociliate.</p>



<p>The discovery is a little surprising given that “ciliates are not normally seen as agents of mass mortality,” says Ian Hewson, a marine microbial ecologist at Cornell University. But the evidence, described April 19 in <em>Science Advances</em>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg3200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all points to the organism</a>, <em>Philaster apodigitiformis</em>, infecting the urchins, he says. “In all of my years of investigating marine diseases, this is the one which we are 100 percent confident about.”</p>





<p>Scuticociliates are found across the world’s oceans. Given their ubiquity, it’s unknown what conditions may have allowed <em>P. apodigitiformis</em> to become so detrimental to the urchins. It’s also unclear how it causes infection.</p>



<p>While there are no available treatments for the disease, knowing the pathogen’s identity allows for the development of possible options. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Long-spined sea urchins (<em>Diadema antillarum</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saba-caribbean-island-species-conservation">play a crucial role</a> in Caribbean coral reefs, grazing algae that would otherwise smother corals (<em>SN</em>: <em>9/27/22</em>). In the 1980s, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sea-urchins-death-caribbean">urchins nearly disappeared during a massive die-off</a>, the cause of which remains unknown (<em>SN: 6/16/84</em>).</p>



<p>Decades of restoration efforts had made some progress when an alarmingly similar mortality event began to spread in January 2022, wiping out thousands of urchins. This time, scientists across the United States and the Caribbean sprang into action.</p>



<p>Three teams independently reached the same conclusion about <em>P. apodigitiformis</em>, using different approaches. Hewson’s team compared the entire set of active genes, or the transcriptome,&nbsp;of healthy and sick urchins from 23 sites across the Caribbean. The researchers noticed that some of the active genes in the sick urchins’ transcriptomes weren’t from the urchins but from the microorganism. Meanwhile, teams in Florida and Hawaii observed the scuticociliates in the tissues and fluids of sick urchins, reinforcing the genetic finding.</p>



<p>Upon a closer look, the scuticociliates tended to cluster in the sick urchins’ body walls and at the base of their spines. The microorganisms were absent from healthy urchins.</p>





<p>The next step was to isolate the pathogen and infect healthy urchins. Four days after infection, six of 10 infected urchins lost many spines — a common symptom of sick urchins. None of the uninfected urchins lost spines.</p>



<p>“It was really exciting to see,” says Michael Sweet, a marine disease ecologist at the University of Derby in England, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Scary, but also exciting to see the [ciliate’s] name mentioned in a different context because <em>Philaster</em> has never been related to urchin diseases before.” His research <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110115300095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">points to the involvement of the genus</a> in several coral diseases.</p>



<p>While the scuticociliate clearly plays a pivotal role, Sweet says, there are almost certainly other factors at play, such as other microorganisms or environmental stressors, that could help explain what triggered the start of the recent die-off. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, it’s unknown if the same pathogen was involved in the 1980s die-off. Hewson’s team hopes to answer that question by looking at museum specimens from the period.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/map-human-brain-movement-homunculus">The classic map of how the human brain manages movement gets an update</a></h4>

              
                <p>The classical view of how the human brain controls voluntary movement might not tell the whole story.</p>



<p>That map of the primary motor cortex — the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homunculus-reimagined">motor homunculus</a> — shows how this brain region is divided into sections assigned to each body part that can be controlled voluntarily (<em>SN: 6/16/15</em>). It puts your toes next to your ankle, and your neck next to your thumb. The space each part takes up on the cortex is also proportional to how much control one has over that part. Each finger, for example, takes up more space than a whole thigh.&nbsp;</p>





<p>A new map reveals that in addition to having regions devoted to specific body parts, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05964-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three newfound areas control integrative, whole-body actions</a>. And representations of where specific body parts fall on this map are organized differently than previously thought, researchers report April 19 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Research in monkeys had hinted at this. “There is a whole cohort of people who have known for 50 years that the homunculus isn&#8217;t quite right,” says Evan Gordon, a neuroscientist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. But ever since pioneering brain-mapping work by neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield starting in the 1930s, the homunculus has reigned supreme in neuroscience.</p>



<p>Gordon and his colleagues study synchronized activity and communication between different brain regions. They noticed some spots in the primary motor cortex were linked to unexpected areas involved in action control and pain perception. Because that didn’t fit with the homunculus map, they wrote it off as a result of imperfect data. “But we kept seeing it, and it kept bugging us,” Gordon says.</p>



<p>So the team gathered functional MRI data on volunteers as they performed various tasks.</p>



<p>Two participants completed simple movements like moving just their eyebrows or toes, as well as complex tasks like simultaneously rotating their wrist and moving their foot from side to side.</p>



<p>The fMRI data revealed which parts of the brain activated at the same time as each task was done, allowing the researchers to trace which regions were functionally connected to one another. Seven more participants were recorded while not doing any particular task in order to look at how brain areas communicate during rest.</p>



<p>Testing only a few participants, each for many hours, offers unique insights into neural connectivity, Gordon says. “When we collect this much data in individuals, we constantly start seeing things that people have never really noticed before.”</p>





<p>The team discovered that while the brain-body part connections vaguely follow the pattern discovered by Penfield, the primary motor cortex is organized into three distinct sections. Each represents different body regions: lower body, torso and arms, and head.</p>



<p>Within each of these sections, the outermost body part of that region is mapped to the center of that section. For example, the area of the primary motor cortex assigned to the lower body has the toes in the middle with other leg parts radiating out in each direction from it. As a result, the entire section is organized like this: hip, knee, ankle, toes, ankle, knee, hip.</p>

<p>The team also unexpectedly found three mysterious spots not linked to a specific body part. Dubbed intereffector regions, they connect to an external network involved in action control and the sensing of pain. These regions alternate with the sections devoted to specific body parts. The team suspects that intereffector regions may integrate action goals and body movements involving multiple body parts, while the spaces in between are used for precise movements of isolated body parts.</p>



<p>Using previous data from three large fMRI studies, which include data from around 50,000 people, the team verified that this organization was consistent across a wide swath of people. Similar patterns also appeared in existing datasets from macaque monkeys, children and clinical populations.</p>



<p>“I think it was just easy to miss anything that seemed anomalous — must be noise,” says Michael Graziano, a neuroscientist at Princeton University who was not involved in the research. But with access to these huge datasets, “you get these vast numbers of subjects, and the pattern is crystal clear, and you can&#8217;t ignore it …. This is really the best example I&#8217;ve seen in a long, long time of looking at humans and trying to figure out at a detailed level what is the organization.”</p>



<p>Gordon’s team now plans to see whether these intereffector regions play a role in certain kinds of pain. More broadly, the team hopes their findings will prompt more in-depth research of what specific areas of the brain do. With new techniques and equipment, there is much left to explore, Gordon says. “Brain mapping isn’t dead.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prehistoric-method-clothes-bone-leather">A prehistoric method for tailoring clothes may be written in bone</a></h4>

              
                <p>An animal bone fragment full of human-made pits hints at how prehistoric people in Western Europe may have crafted clothing.</p>



<p>The nearly 40,000-year-old artifact probably served as a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg0834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punch board for leatherwork</a>, researchers report April 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>. They suggest that the bone fragment rested beneath animal hide while an artisan pricked holes in the material, possibly for seams. If so, it’s the earliest-known tool of its kind and predates eyed needles in the region by about 15,000 years.</p>





<p>Found at an archaeological site south of Barcelona, the roughly 11-centimeter-long bone fragment contains 28 punctures scattered across one flat side, with 10 of them aligned and fairly evenly spaced.</p>



<p>The marks don’t seem to have been a notation system or decoration, given that some holes are hard to see and the bone fragment wasn’t otherwise shaped, says archaeologist Luc Doyon of the University of Bordeaux in France. He thought leatherwork could have made the marks. But it wasn’t until he visited a cobbler shop and <a></a>saw one of the artisan’s tools that the hypothesis solidified, guiding Doyon’s next steps.</p>



<p>He and colleagues attempted to re-create the artifact’s holes by puncturing cattle rib bones with tools including sharpened flint, horns and antlers. Piercing leather atop bone with a burin — a pointed stone chisel — by tapping it with a hammerlike tool created pits that resemble those on the bone fragment.</p>



<p>Further experiments suggested the artifact’s 10 orderly punctures were made by the same tool and intentionally aligned and regularly spaced. This hints that holes were created in the leather to make a seam sewn with a threading tool.</p>



<p>Scientists knew that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lice-hang-ancient-date-first-clothes">humans wore clothing long before the oldest-known eyed needles existed</a> (<em>SN: 4/20/10</em>). “What [the new finding] tells us is that the first modern humans who lived in Europe had the technology in their toolkit for making fitted clothes,” Doyon says.</p>

<p>A professor of cell biology in Japan faked data in an influential cancer study published in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> in 2019, according to an investigation by Okayama University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The school, which released a <a href="https://www.okayama-u.ac.jp/up_load_files/news/20230324houkoku01.pdf">report</a> with its findings last month (in Japanese), found no fewer than 113 instances of fabrication as well as problems with several images in the<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0430-3"> paper</a>, titled “Genetic manipulation of autonomic nerve fiber innervation and activity and its effect on breast cancer progression.”</p>



<p>The report identified Okayama&#8217;s<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamiya-atsunori-7b01024b/?originalSubdomain=jp"> Atsunori Kamiya</a> as being involved in the misconduct and recommended retracting the article, which has been cited 134 times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science. The paper has yet to be retracted, but an editor from the journal said they are looking into the case.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126906"></span>



<p>Kamiya also is a former director of the Department of Cardiovascular Control at the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute in Suita, Japan. The center took part in Okayama&#8217;s investigation.</p>

<p>When asked for the paper’s underlying data, Kamiya claimed that the hard disk storing them fell and broke during the June 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/osaka-earthquake-japan-61-magnitude-tremor">North Osaka earthquake</a>. The paper versions were destroyed after chemical liquids from refrigerators and shelves fell on them during the earthquake, Kamiya told investigators.</p>



<p>The report also notes that Kamiya claimed the problems with figures in the paper were due to a &#8220;mix-up&#8221; with images.</p>



<p>According to a news <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14869862">story</a> in <em>The Asahi Shimbun</em> about the case, &#8220;The two organizations concluded that Kamiya’s fabrications were so flagrant that he lacked a sense of ethics as a scientist.&#8221; (The newspaper retracted a <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/photo/27472914">2019 story about Kamiya&#8217;s work</a>.)</p>



<p>The study was first<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/64FCCAB9E4267D5A1DBC8A631F0509"> flagged on PubPeer</a> in 2021. The probe also looked into two other studies coauthored by Kamiya, but found no evidence of misconduct.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/methane-warm-earth-atmosphere-radiation">Methane may not warm the Earth quite as much as previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Methane is a greenhouse gas with dual personalities. It heats Earth’s atmosphere 28 times as potently as carbon dioxide, gram for gram. But its absorption of the sun’s radiation high in the atmosphere also alters cloud patterns — casting a bit of shadow on its warming effect.</p>



<p>So rather than adding even more thermal energy to the atmosphere, as previously thought, methane’s solar absorption sets off a cascade of events that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01144-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces its overall warming effect by about 30 percent</a>, researchers report March 16 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>





<p>“These are really interesting and important results,” says Rachael Byrom, a climate scientist at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo who wasn’t involved in the new study. Nonetheless, she says, “methane still remains a really key gas that we need to target in emissions reductions.”</p>



<p>Humans are responsible for most of the methane entering the atmosphere, where it worsens global warming. Concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/increase-in-atmospheric-methane-set-another-record-during-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have risen</a> about 162 percent since preindustrial times, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://sciencecouncil.noaa.gov/Portals/0/Council%20Products/MethaneFactSheet_AUG22.pdf?ver=2022-11-09-133904-120#:~:text=The%20largest%20share%20of%20methane&#039;s,include%20wetlands%20and%20freshwater%20systems." target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest sources of anthropogenic methane</a> include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gas-flare-leak-methane-burning-climate">fossil fuel use</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/agriculture-fossil-fuels-are-driving-record-high-methane-emissions">livestock, rice farming</a>, landfills and biomass burning (<em>SN: 9/29/22; SN: 7/14/20</em>). Scientists fear that as warming triggers thaw of permafrost in the Arctic regions, this could also lead to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">increased methane emissions</a>, as microbes in the soil consume dead plant material and release the gas (<em>SN: 9/25/19)</em>.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gases like methane exert their strongest effects by absorbing infrared “longwave” radiation emitted from the planet’s surface. Earth emits this longwave radiation when it is struck by “shortwave” radiation coming directly from the sun. Most studies of greenhouse gases focus on longwave absorption.</p>



<p>But scientists are learning that greenhouse gases, including methane, also absorb some of the sun’s shortwave radiation. Recent estimates suggested that methane might contribute up to <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 percent more</a> thermal energy to the atmosphere than previously thought, due to this additional shortwave absorption.</p>



<p>However, the new study reveals that methane’s shortwave absorption has the opposite effect. This finding is based on a detailed analysis of the gas’s absorption at various wavelengths.</p>



<p>The result is “counterintuitive,” says climate scientist Robert Allen of the University of California, Riverside. It happens because of the way that methane’s shortwave absorbance affects clouds in different layers of the atmosphere, Allen and colleagues’ simulations suggest.</p>



<p>When methane absorbs shortwave radiation in the middle and upper troposphere, above about three kilometers, it further warms the air — leading to fewer clouds in that upper layer. And because methane absorbs shortwave radiation high up, less of that radiation penetrates down to the lower troposphere. This actually cools the lower troposphere, leading to more clouds in that layer.</p>



<p>These thicker low-level clouds reflect more of the sun’s shortwave radiation back out to space — meaning that less of this solar radiation reaches Earth’s surface, to be converted into longwave radiation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, upper-level clouds, in addition to greenhouse gases, are known to absorb longwave radiation. So fewer of these clouds means that less of the longwave radiation emitted by Earth is captured in the atmosphere — and more of it escapes to space without contributing to climate change.</p>



<p>With methane’s shortwave absorption, “you expect warming of the climate system,” Allen says. “But these cloud adjustments actually overwhelm the heating due to absorption, leading to a cooling effect.”</p>



<p>Allen and his colleagues conducted the study using a computational model of Earth’s climate. When they took the traditional approach — considering only methane’s longwave absorbance — they estimated that the gas has caused 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming since preindustrial times, out of <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature#:~:text=Earth&#039;s%20temperature%20has%20risen%20by,2%C2%B0%20F%20in%20total." target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.06 degrees C total warming</a>. But when they also included shortwave absorbance, methane’s contribution to warming fell to about 0.16 degrees C.</p>



<p>In addition to warming the planet, methane is also thought to increase global precipitation, due to greater evaporation of water with higher temperatures. But the researchers found that inclusion of shortwave absorbance also reduced methane’s precipitation effect, from a predicted 0.3 percent increase in precipitation (based on longwave absorbance alone), down to an increase of about 0.18 percent.</p>

<p>It will be important to include methane’s shortwave effects in future climate projections, says Daniel Feldman, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved in the study. But he thinks that more work needs to be done to clarify those effects.</p>



<p>The new study analyzed methane’s shortwave impact using only one comprehensive model that included both the atmosphere and ocean, he says. “I would just like to see that sort of analysis done across multiple models,” increasing confidence in the results.</p>
