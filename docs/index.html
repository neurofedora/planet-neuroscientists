</div>


<p>A “high and far reaching” number of papers and books by Hans Eysenck could be “unsafe,” according to<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/statements/hans-eysenck"> an updated statement</a> from King’s College London, where the psychologist was a professor emeritus when he died in 1997.</p>



<p>A<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/assets/news-statements/hans-eysenck-enquiry-final-may-2019.pdf"> 2019 investigation</a> launched by the U.K. institution found 26 papers coauthored by Eysenck and <a href="https://www.ruprecht.de/2020/01/28/the-legacy-of-a-scandal/">Ronald Grossarth-Maticek</a>, a social scientist in Germany, were based on questionable data and contained findings that were “incompatible with modern clinical science and the understanding of disease processes.”</p>



<p>For example, the two researchers’ data showed people with a “cancer-prone” personality were<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105318822045"> more than 120 times as likely to die</a> from the disease as were those with a “healthy” personality, Anthony Pelosi, a longtime Eysenck critic, pointed out in an article preceding the university probe.</p>



<span id="more-133498"></span>



<p>Based on its review, the investigation committee recommended King’s inform journal editors that it considered the results and conclusions of the 26 papers “unsafe.” Several retractions, and dozens of expressions of concern,<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/02/12/journals-retract-three-papers-by-hans-eysenck-flag-18-some-60-years-old/"> quickly followed</a>, as<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=hans+eysenck"> we reported at the time</a>.</p>



<p>However, some observers,<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/30/61-retractions-for-controversial-psychologist-hans-eysenck-thats-a-significant-underestimate-says-his-biographer/"> including Eysenck’s biographer</a> Rod Buchanan,<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105319887791"> criticized</a> the university for leaving out publications written solely by Eysenck, but based on the same suspect data Grossarth-Maticek had collected. Grossarth-Maticek died on November 16.</p>



<p>In November 2019, Buchanan and then-editor of the <em>Journal of Health Psychology</em> David Marks compiled<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1359105319887791/suppl_file/appendix_-_unsafe_list_26_11_19_suppl_material.pdf">a list of more than 80</a> “suspect” papers and books they believed should be retracted.</p>



<p>“In this case we are up against the seductive allure of claims we’d like to believe are true but aren’t – that tobacco is really not that harmful, at least not by itself, or that we can prevent and cure cancer with some kind of ‘mind work,’ and so on,” Buchanan told us. “This dubious research needs to be flagged with sufficient prominence and transparency wherever it appears to prevent researchers taking it in good faith.”</p>



<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-4440-0">A 1991 book</a> by Eysenck, for instance, claimed psychosocial factors like stress and personality type were six times as predictive of cancer and heart disease as smoking, cholesterol levels or blood pressure. Pelosi told us the book summarized Eysenck’s work with Grossarth-Maticek and <a href="https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/htbl0000/">a draft had been sent</a> to tobacco giant Philip Morris International, which helped <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105318822045">fund the two researchers’ work</a>.</p>



<p>“It is utterly irresponsible in its presentation of Eysenck and Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s ridiculous claims and in its undermining of public health,” Pelosi said.</p>



<p>In October, six years later after its initial investigation, King’s stated that, “because the number of potentially relevant publications is high and far reaching, including journal articles and books, we cannot with certainty locate and review all relevant sources which are of potential concern. However, based on enquiries to date we can confirm that any publication which relies on the data from those co-authored publications which King’s has already deemed to be unsafe, should also be considered unsafe.”</p>



<p>The university continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Any journal or publisher which hosts any publications either sole authored by Professor Hans Eysenck or co-authored by Professor Hans Eysenck with Professor Ronald Grossarth Maticek which rely on data from any of the papers listed in the 2019 Enquiry, is advised to provide a link to this public statement to alert those accessing to these concerns.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“I think this is the minimum that could be done,” Buchanan said. “The introduction to the recommended link ought to specify the nature of these concerns where possible and be displayed prominently for maximum effect.”</p>



<p>Buchanan said he would also have liked to see a link in King’s statement to the list of “suspect” publications he compiled with Marks, which “would also provide guidance if and when publishers don’t take this appropriate action.”</p>



<p>Pelosi welcomed the update from the university and noted its earlier statement about the papers Eysenck and Ronald Grossarth-Maticek authored together “has led to over 20 retractions from the scientific literature. Almost all the journals that were contacted followed their recommendations.” A few did not, however, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/02/26/journal-founded-by-hans-eysenck-issues-expressions-of-concern-for-his-papers-despite-calls-by-university-to-retract/">including <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em></a>, which Eysenck founded in 1980, as we reported at the time.</p>



<p>Springer Nature did not respond to a request for comment on the new statement and which action, if any, the publisher planned to take on Eysenck’s book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authors of a highly publicized study predicting climate change would cost $38 trillion a year by 2049 have retracted their paper following criticism of the data and methodology, including that the estimate is inflated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07219-0">The economic commitment of climate change</a>,” which appeared April 17, 2024, in <em>Nature</em>, looked at how changes in temperature and precipitation could affect economic growth. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2024/04/17/climate-change-will-cost-global-economy-38-trillion-every-year-within-25-years-scientists-warn/">Forbes</a>, the <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/04/17/new-study-calculates-climate-changes-economic-bite-will-hit-about-38-trillion-a-year-by-2049/">San Diego Union-Tribune</a> and other outlets covered the paper, which has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07219-0/metrics">accessed over 300,000 times</a>. It has been cited 168 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>But after two commentaries published this August raised questions about the study’s data and methodology, the researchers revisited their findings. “The authors acknowledge that these changes are too substantial for a correction,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09726-0">the retraction notice</a>, published today, states.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133485"></span>



<p>The authors, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany, revised their analysis and <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15984134">posted it as a preprint</a> in August. They plan to submit a revision, which they say accounts for issues raised in the critiques, for peer review.</p>



<p>“We broadly agree with the issues raised, and have made corrections to the underlying economic data and to our methodology to address them,” the authors told us via a statement from the PIK press office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corresponding author <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/~wenz/">Leonie Wenz</a> is deputy head of the Complexity Science Department at PIK and a professor at Technical University Berlin. Wenz, lead author <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/maxkotz">Maximilian Kotz</a>, and their coauthor <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/anders/homepage">Anders Levermann</a>, head of PIK&#8217;s Complexity Science Department and a professor at Potsdam University, agreed with the retraction. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07732-2">In July 2024</a>, <em>Nature</em> issued a correction to the article that addressed rows of data which were “wrongly printed as a decimal, rather than a percentage point.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Nature</em> has retracted 32 papers since 2020, including three in 2024. The retraction today marks the sixth for the journal in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Authors of the first “Matters Arising” commentary <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09320-4">published August 6</a> noted the article projected the global gross domestic product would be lowered by 62 percent by 2100, “an impact roughly 3 times larger than similar previous estimates.” The authors of the critique also pointed out the PIK authors had used a dataset for Uzbekistan with “anomalies.” By removing the Uzbek dataset, the estimate in the original paper “aligns closely with previous literature,” the critique reads.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09206-5">second Matters Arising</a>, published a week later, <a href="https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/esm/staff-members/schoetz-christof-dr/">Christof Schötz</a>, a researcher at the Technical University of Munich in Ottobrunn, Germany, and a researcher at PIK, argued the analysis in the paper “underestimates uncertainty … rendering their results statistically insignificant when properly corrected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PIK press office responded to our request for comment from the authors, including more information regarding the new data and where they plan to submit for publication, with a copy of the embargoed retraction notice, as did <em>Nature</em>’s press team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the climate study say their reanalysis addresses issues pointed out in both commentaries. The revision “did not significantly alter the central estimates, but did increase the uncertainty range they sat within.” The new estimate for income reduction is now 17 percent after 26 years rather than the originally published 19 percent, according to <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/questions-and-answers-nature-study">a September statement</a> from PIK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schötz told Retraction Watch the issues he raised “were not resolved by the authors&#8217; correction.” He said the revised data account for some correlation between areas close together but “still ignores many strong correlations” between areas with similar data that might be farther apart. </p>



<p>The correlations the authors missed were “not due to physical distance but due to the regions being part of the same economic zone in some sense,” Schötz said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked for a response to Schötz’s doubts regarding the new data, the researchers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PIK-Press-Office-Response-Nature-retraction.pdf">responded through the PIK press office</a>, emphasizing the correction is not yet peer reviewed. The authors also explained their decision to omit correlations between areas farther apart by noting the relationships “decayed with distance.”&nbsp;</p>

</div>


<p>Many would-be whistleblowers write to us about papers with nonexistent references, possibly hallucinated by artificial intelligence. One reader recently alerted us to fake references in … an ethics journal. In an article about whistleblowing.</p>



<p>The paper, published in April in the <em>Journal of Academic Ethics</em>, explored “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10805-025-09630-2">the whistleblowing experiences of individuals with disabilities</a> in Ethiopian public educational institutions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erja Moore, an independent researcher based in Finland, came across the article while looking into a whistleblowing case in that country. “I started reading this article and found some interesting references that I decided to read as well,” Moore told Retraction Watch. “To my surprise, those articles didn&#8217;t exist.”</p>



<span id="more-133481"></span>



<p>The article joins a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/28/challenge-accepted-a-reader-wrote-a-program-to-find-fake-references-in-books/">long list</a> of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/16/springer-nature-to-retract-machine-learning-book-following-retraction-watch-coverage/">publications</a> flagged for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/04/kpmg-government-report-on-research-integrity-makes-up-reference-involving-retraction-watch-founders/">fake</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/21/springer-nature-flags-paper-with-fabricated-reference-to-article-not-written-by-our-cofounder/">references</a>, which can be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/13/humanities-social-sciences-communications-springer-nature-sex-robot-bibliometrics/">hallucinations</a> generated by a large language model like <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/">ChatGPT</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore ended up analyzing all of the paper’s 29 references and found at least 19 of them appear to be fabricated, by her count. Eighteen of the Google Scholar links in the online reference section turn up empty. Moore dug in further, searching for the article titles, common works by the authors, and the journal’s volumes and issues to triple check whether some portion of the reference may have been incorrect rather than made up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What she found in many cases were a nonexistent article title by authors who have written other papers on the reference’s topic; a similarly titled article in a completely different journal by different authors; or (and sometimes, and) a journal volume, issue and page number leading to a totally different article than the one in the references.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Journal of Academic Ethics</em> is published by Springer Nature. Eleven of the fabricated references cite papers in the <em>Journal of Business Ethics </em>— another Springer Nature title.</p>



<p>“On one hand this is hilarious that an ethics journal publishes this, but on the other hand it seems that this is a much bigger problem in publishing and we can&#8217;t really trust scientific articles any more,” Moore said.</p>



<p>Yelkal Mulualem Walle of the Department of Information Technology at the University of Gondar in Ethiopia, and the corresponding author of the article, told us he and his coauthors used ChatGPT to generate the references. “However, the research is real and used real data,” he said by email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coauthors Seyoum Tilahun Gedefaw at the university’s College of Education and Haregot Abreha Bezabih of the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission in Addis Ababa did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Michael Stacey, Head of Communications, Journals for Springer Nature confirmed the publisher is aware of the concerns raised. “We take all such concerns about papers we have published extremely seriously and are now looking into the matter carefully,” he told us.</p>



<p>Hallucinated references in general “are an area we are actively exploring,” said Chris Graf, research integrity director for Springer Nature. “This is more complex than it may at first appear, as references can be detailed by authors in a variety of different ways, often do not include DOIs, and simple tools to identify hallucinated references can produce false positives.”</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Moore has come across fake references. Last year she gave a presentation, <a href="https://plagiointitutkija.blogspot.com/2024/09/opinnaytetoiden-olemattomat-lahteet.html">summarized on her blog</a>, on fake references in Finnish master’s theses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a very old-fashioned sense of justice and think it is a duty to report scientific misconduct,” Moore said.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/no-chatbots-are-not-scientists/">No, chatbots are not scientists</a></h4>

              
                <p>I can’t believe I need to write this, but apparently, I do. Many journals and preprint sites are now overwhelmed with chatbot-generated submissions. This is bad, but at least it gets characterized as fraud, something that we need to defend against. What I find much more worrying is that respectable scientists don’t seem to see the problem with generating part of their papers with a chatbot, and journals are seriously considering using chatbots to review papers, as they struggle to find reviewers. This is usually backed up by anthropomorphic discourse, such as calling a chatbot “PhD level AI”. This is to be expected from the CEO of a chatbot company, but unfortunately, it is not unusual to hear colleagues describe chatbots as some sort of “interns”. The rationale is that what the chatbot produces looks like a text that a good intern could produce. Or that the chatbot “writes better than me”. Or that it “knows” much more than the average scientist about most subjects (does an encyclopedia “know” more than you too?).</p>



<p>First of all, what’s a chatbot? Of course, I am referring to large language models (LLMs), which are statistical models of text tuned on very large text databases. An LLM is not about truth, but about what is written in the database (whether right, wrong, invented or nonsensical), and <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-xi-why-large-language-models-are-not-conscious/">it is certainly not about personhood</a>. But the term chatbot emphasizes the deceptive dimension of this technology, namely, it is a statistical model that is conceived in such a way as to fool the user into believing that an actual person is talking. It is the intersection of advanced statistical technology and bullshit capitalism. We have become familiar with bullshit capitalism: a mode of financing based not on the expected revenues of the company that can be reasonably anticipated from a well-conceived business plan, but on closed-loop speculation about the short-term explosion of the share value of a company that sells nothing, based on a “pitch”. Thus, funders are apparently perfectly fine with a CEO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pLnyjxgFxew">explaining that his business plan to make revenue is to build a superhuman AI and ask it to come up with an idea</a>. It’s a joke, right. But he still did not clearly explain how he would make a revenue, so not really a joke.</p>



<p>Scientists should not fall for that. Chatbots are essentially statistical models. No one is actually speaking or taking responsibility for what is being written. The argument that chatbot-generated text resembles scientist-generated text is a tragic misunderstanding of the nature of science. Doing science is not producing text that looks sciency. A PhD is not about learning to do calculations, code, or developing sophisticated technical skills (although it’s obviously an important part of the training). It is about learning to prove (or disprove) claims. At core, it is the development of an ethical attitude to knowledge.</p>



<p>I know, a number of scientists who have read or heard of a couple of 1970-1980s classics in philosophy or sociology of science will object that truth doesn’t exist, or even that it is an authoritarian ideal, and it’s all conventions. Well, at a time when authoritarian politicians are claiming that scientific discourse has no more value than political opinions, we should perhaps pause and reflect a little bit on that position. First of all, it’s a self-defeating position. If it is true, then maybe it’s not true. This alone should make one realize that there might be something wrong with that position. Sure, truth doesn’t exist. That is because any general statement can always potentially be contradicted by future observations. In science, general claims are provisional. Sure. But consistency with current observations and theories does exist, and wrongness certainly does exist too. And sure, scientific claims are necessarily expressed in a certain theoretical context, and this context can always be challenged. But on what basis do we challenge theories and claims? Well, obviously based on whether we think the theories are incorrect or partial or misleading, so on the basis of epistemic norms – don’t call it “truth” if you want to sound philosophically aware, but we’re clearly in the same lexical field.</p>



<p>So, “truth doesn’t exist” is a fine provocative slogan, but certainly a misleading one, unless its meaning is carefully unpacked. Science is all about arguing, challenging claims with arguments, backing up theories with reasoning and experiments, looking for loopholes in reasoning, and generally about demonstrating. Therefore, what defines scientific work is not the application of specific methods and procedures (these differ widely between fields), but <a href="https://www.medecinesciences.org/fr/articles/medsci/full_html/2022/01/msc200454/msc200454.html">an ethical commitment</a>: a commitment to an ideal of truth (or “truth”, if you prefer). This is what a PhD student is supposed to learn: to back up each of their claims with arguments; to challenge the claims of others, or to look for loopholes in their own arguments; to try to resolve apparent contradictions; to think of what might support or disprove a position.</p>



<p>It should be obvious then that to write science is not to produce text that simply looks like a scientific text. The scientific text must reflect the actual reasoning of the scientist, which reflects their best efforts to demonstrate claims. This is precisely what a statistical model cannot do. Everyone has noticed that a chatbot can be cued to claim one thing and the contrary within a few sentences. Nothing surprising there. It is very implausible that everything that has been written on the internet is internally consistent, so a good statistical model of that text will never produce consistent reasonings.</p>



<p>Let us see now some concrete use cases of chatbots in science. Given the preceding remarks, the worst possible case I can see is reviewing. No, a statistical model is not a peer, and no it doesn’t “reason” or “critically thinks”. Yes, it can generate sentences that look like reasoning or criticisms. But it could be right, it could be wrong, who knows. I hear the argument that human reviews are often pretty bad anyway. What kind of argument is that? Since mediocre reviewing is the norm, why not just generalizing it? The scientific ecosystem has already been largely sabotaged by managerial ideologies and publishing sharks, so let’s just finish the work? If that’s the argument, then let’s just give up science entirely.</p>



<p>Other use case: generating the text of your paper. It’s not as bad, but it’s bad. Of course, there are degrees. I can imagine that, like myself, one may not be a native English speaker, and some technological help to polish the language could be helpful (I personally don’t use it for that because I think even the writing style of a chatbot is awful). But the temptation is great to use it to turn a series of vague statements into a nice-sounding prose. The problem is that, by construction, whatever was not in the prompt is made up. The chatbot does not know your study, it does not know the specific context of your vague statements. It can be a struggle to turn “raw results” into scientific text, but that is largely because it takes work to make explicit all the implicit assumptions that you make, to turn your intuitions into sound logical reasoning. And if you did not explicitly put it in the prompt in the first place, then the statistical model makes it up – there’s no magic. It may sound good, but it’s not science.</p>



<p>Even worse is the use of a chatbot to write introduction and discussion. Many people find it hard to write those parts. They are right: it is hard. This is because this is where the results get connected to the whole body of knowledge, where you try to resolve contradictions or reinterpret previous results, where you must use scholarship. This is particularly hard for students because it requires experience and broad scholarship. But it is in making those connections, by careful contextualized argumentation, that the web of knowledge gets extended. Sure, this is not always done as it should be. But scientists should work on that skill, not improve the productivity of mediocre writing.</p>



<p>One might object that there is already much story-telling in scientific papers currently written by humans, especially in the “prestigious” journals, and especially in biology (not mentioning neuroscience, which is even worse). Well yes, but that is obviously a problem to solve, not something we should amplify by automation!</p>



<p>Let me briefly comment on other uses of this technology. One is to generate code. This can be helpful, say, to quickly generate a user interface, or to find the right commands to make a specific plot. This is fine when you can easily tell whether the code is correct or not – looking for the right syntax for a given command is such a use case. But it starts getting problematic when you use it to perform some analysis, especially when the analysis is not standard. There is no guarantee whatsoever that the analysis is done correctly, other than by checking yourself, which requires understanding it. So, in a scientific context, I anticipate that this will cause some issues. When I review a paper, I rarely check the code (it is usually not available anyway) to make sure it does what the paper claims. I trust the authors (unless of course some oddity catches my attention). Some level of trust is inevitable in peer review. I can see the temptation of a programming-averse biologist to just ask a chatbot to do their analyses, rather than looking for technical help. But the result of that is likely to be a rise in the rate of hard-to-spot technical errors.</p>



<p>Another common use is bibliographic search. Some tools are in fact quite powerful, if you understand that you are dealing with a sophisticated search engine, not an expert who summarizes the findings of the literature or of individual papers. For example, I could use it to look for a pharmacological blocker of an ionic channel, which will generally not be the main topic of the papers that use it. The model will output a series of matching papers. In general, the generated description of those papers is pretty bad and untrustable. But, if the references are correct, I can just look up the papers and check for myself. It is basically one way to do content-based search and it should be treated like that, in complement of other methods (looking for reviews, following the tree of citations etc.).</p>



<p>In summary, no, chatbots are not scientists, not even baby scientists: science is about (at least should be about) proving what you claim, not about producing sciency text. Science is an ethical attitude to knowledge, not a bag of methods, and only persons have ethics. Encouraging scientists to write their papers with a chatbot, or worse, automating reviewing with chatbots, is an extremely destructive move and should not be tolerated. This is not the solution to the problems that science currently faces. The solution to those problems is to be political, not technological, and we know it. And please, please, my dear fellow scientists, stop with the anthropomorphic talk. <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-xi-why-large-language-models-are-not-conscious/">It’s an algorithm, it’s not a person</a>, and you should know it.</p>



<p>All this comes in addition to the many other ethical issues that so-called AI raises, on which a number of talented scholars have written at length (a few pointers: <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/">Emily Bender</a>, <a href="https://abebabirhane.com/">Abeba Birhane</a>, <a href="https://olivia.science/">Olivia Guest</a>, <a href="https://irisvanrooijcogsci.com/">Iris van Rooij</a>, <a href="https://melaniemitchell.me/">Melanie Mitchell</a>, <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/">Gary Marcus</a>).</p>

<p>The influential citation database Scopus has<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/content"> delisted</a> three journals from Iraq in a blow to<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/during-1st-conference-of-editorial-boards-of-scientific-journals-dr-alaboudi-confirms-doubling-presence-of-iraqi-university-journals-in-international-publications-2025-09-10-19"> recent government efforts to boost the standing</a> of the country’s scholarly publications. One of the titles, which was included in Clarivate’s Web of Science, was dropped from that index as well.</p>



<p>Last month we reported on allegations that one of the delisted journals, the<a href="https://journals.lww.com/mjby/pages/default.aspx"> <em>Medical Journal of Babylon</em></a>, a publication of the University of Babylon in Hilla, was<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/17/exclusive-iraqi-university-forcing-students-to-cite-its-journals-to-graduate/"> coercing authors to cite its articles</a>. Citation manipulation is widespread<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/27/mustansiriyah-university-iraq-researchers-must-cite-colleagues-school-journals-in-papers/"> in Iraq</a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/24/exclusive-highly-problematic-policy-has-saudi-university-pressuring-faculty-to-cite-its-research/"> and</a><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings"> elsewhere</a>, but is considered a form of<a href="https://publicationethics.org/topic-discussions/citation-manipulation"> scientific misconduct</a>.</p>



<p>“The <em>Medical Journal of Babylon</em> was flagged for re-evaluation at the end of September when we received concerns, and because we observed outlier publication performance,” said a spokesperson from Elsevier, which owns Scopus. The publisher marked the journal as delisted in <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/o78em1y1w4i4/7xtaTxNiNcWRTeZkV86eNy/92160b989d43a5f05d6d3a4fc7adee60/ext_list_Oct_2025.xlsx">its October update</a> of indexed and delisted titles.</p>



<span id="more-133468"></span>



<p>Elsevier also removed from its database the<a href="https://djm.uodiyala.edu.iq/index.php"> <em>Diyala Journal of Medicine</em></a>, a publication of the University of Diyala in Baqubah, and the<a href="https://jcoagri.uobaghdad.edu.iq/"><em> </em><em>Iraqi Journal of Agricultural Sciences</em></a>, which is published by the University of Baghdad.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Clarivate has dropped the <em>Iraqi Journal of Agricultural Sciences</em> from its<a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/home"> Master Journal List</a>, according to<a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/collection-list-downloads"> a November 17 update</a> from the company. The title was listed in Web of Science’s Emerging Sources Citation Index.</p>



<p>The “journal was removed because it no longer meets our publicly available<a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/journal-evaluation-process-selection-criteria/"> quality criteria</a>,” a Clarivate spokesperson told us. “Specific details of our observations and which criteria were failed are shared with the publisher in advance of removal from the MJL. However, we do not share these details with other parties.”</p>



<p>None of the editors-in-chief of the three publications responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>The Iraqi government has<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/dr-alaboudi-iraq-concludes-education-2025-conference-with-strategic-agreement-with-clarivate-amp-announcement-of-its-achievements-in-times-higher-education-world-university-rankings-2025-10-13-20"> worked to strengthen</a> the international rankings of<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/higher-education-thirtysix-iraqi-universities-obtain-top-scores-in-qs-arab-region-university-rankings-2026-2025-10-16-21"> its universities</a> and<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/during-1st-conference-of-editorial-boards-of-scientific-journals-dr-alaboudi-confirms-doubling-presence-of-iraqi-university-journals-in-international-publications-2025-09-10-19"> scientific journals</a>, which are increasingly<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/higher-education-announces-qualitative-achievement-with-rise-in-citescore-index-for-iraqi-journals-in-scopus-database-2025-07-08-23"> getting indexed</a> in Scopus and, to a lesser extent, Web of Science. But the country allocates little funding to research, and academics say scientific<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/31/exclusive-clarivate-web-of-science-involved-dubious-awards-iraq/"> misconduct is widespread</a>, as it is in other parts of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, we wrote about an Iraqi university that<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/17/exclusive-iraqi-university-forcing-students-to-cite-its-journals-to-graduate/"> required students to cite its journals</a> to graduate. We also described how the chief editorial adviser of the <em>Medical Journal of Babylon</em>,<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6533-6395"> Alaa H. Al-Charrakh</a> of the University of Babylon, had asked a prospective author to cite three published papers in the journal, apparently as a condition for accepting the manuscript.</p>



<p>Al-Charrakh told us at the time he did “not remember writing a letter with this content.” But elsewhere he acknowledged asking authors to cite his publication in their papers,<a href="https://fraudfactor.substack.com/p/how-to-get-delisted-from-scopus-a"> as reported</a> on November 6 in a story about the journal’s delisting in the newsletter FraudFactor.</p>



<p>Al-Charrakh lashed out in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Biothesis/permalink/3712093782425636/"> a November 4 post on Facebook</a> at the anonymous people who alerted Scopus and Retraction Watch to their concerns about academic publishing in Iraq. FraudFactor called the post an “unhinged rant,” with Al-Charrakh referring to his critics as “half-men and quasi-women” and “spiteful people with psychological complexes.” He also said the whistleblowers should be brought to Iraq and held responsible for harming “Iraq&#8217;s academic reputation and its prominent position among regional and international countries.”</p>



<p>Al-Charrakh did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>

<p>A team of researchers in Belgium got more than they expected when they tried to study potato pathogens: an unwelcome contaminant, a retraction, and a new paper the authors say is “an improvement over the first.”</p>



<p>In a now-retracted <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfae004">paper</a> in <em>Metallomics </em>originally published in January 2024, researchers at the University of Liège described how availability of nitrogen and iron changes how the bacterium responsible for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12230-017-9575-3">potato common scab</a> interacts with each of the two microorganisms responsible for early and late blight while infecting the same host. The results suggested the bacterium had antimicrobial properties against both microbes, with nearly all of the experiments focusing on the fungus that causes late blight. </p>



<p>After publication, the authors realized their strain of the late blight-causing microorganism was not the one described in the paper. While the lab originally received the correct strain, “the plates became contaminated, and the fungal contaminant eventually overgrew the strain we intended to study,” <a href="https://www.rigalilab.be/">Sébastien Rigali</a>, corresponding author and professor at the University of Liège, told Retraction Watch. </p>



<span id="more-133445"></span>



<p>Sample contamination in the lab is an ever-present problem for researchers and has led to the retraction of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/26/two-japanese-universities-revoke-phds-one-for-plagiarism-and-one-because-of-cell-line-contamination/">multiple</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186281">papers</a>. For studies using cell lines, resources such as the <a href="https://iclac.org/databases/cross-contaminations/">ICLAC Register of Misidentified Cell Lines</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/30/can-a-nudge-stop-researchers-from-using-the-wrong-cell-lines/">Research Resource Identifiers</a> can help scientists prevent the use of tainted cells. Fungal contamination during preparation and experiments is such a common problem that many <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/biological-contamination.html#fungus">cell</a> <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/cell-culture-and-cell-culture-analysis/mammalian-cell-culture/cell-culture-troubleshooting-contamination?srsltid=AfmBOooTpf9yl3ivVgv6IwawYxh8vUP63gNR7IY1KTMHVi5g1206on_W#microbial">culture</a> <a href="https://www.ptglab.com/support/cell-culture-protocol/cell-contamination/?srsltid=AfmBOooVHZGhbjKEFORFRxNdO-Mt5h0UGvBQJvNnjzohVM4bpCux35GX#Fungal%20(yeast/mold)%20contamination">guidelines</a> include a section on how to handle it.</p>



<p>For the fungus cultures used in the <em>Metallomics </em>study, genome sequencing confirmed the actual strain wasn’t the one described in the paper. “Because our work focused on macroscopic phenotypes, we did not initially notice the contamination; the original strain and the contaminant looked similar on Petri dishes,” Rigali told us in an email. Later, he examined the samples using electron microscopy and “realized the morphology was not as expected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He and his collaborators contacted the journal to request the retraction of the paper, as “the data themselves were scientifically sound, but the biological narrative was wrong because we were unknowingly working with an unintended organism.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even with great care and the best working conditions, mistakes can still occur,” said Rigali. “What would have been far worse is failing to detect the contamination and allowing an incorrect story to remain published.”</p>



<p>The paper was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfae021">retracted</a> in April 2024, less than four months after its publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All collaborators responded unanimously that ‘these things happen,’ emphasizing that what truly mattered was that we retracted the paper almost immediately after publication and submitted a revised version, which we all agree is an improvement over the first,” Rigali said.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfae048">replacement paper</a> was published in <em>Metallomics</em> in October 2024. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfaf037">retraction notice</a> was updated in November 2025 to note the replacement, “which now accurately refers to the correct strain,” the notice states. The new paper’s “objectives and context are properly aligned and more focused on specific environmental nutrients that trigger the antifungal activity of <em>Streptomyces scabiei</em>”— the potato scab-causing bacteria — “through iron deprivation.”</p>



<p>Often the retraction, replacement, and notice are published simultaneously in cases like these, Katherine J. Franz, editor-in-chief of <em>Metallomics</em>,<em> </em>told us. “This time there was a gap between the retraction and the revised version being published, and the revised version is now available,” she said.</p>



<p>Franz added, “My advice to other scientists who may find similar problems is to deal with the issue professionally and honestly so as to uphold the rigor of the scientific process.”</p>
