<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;AI will </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">enhance the future of peer review by using automated systems to analyze and evaluate research articles. It will expedite the review process, improve accuracy, identify biases, and help in handling large volumes of submissions. However, human expertise and judgment will remain crucial in assessing the overall quality and impact of research.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;  ChatGPT-3.5</span></p>
<p>For many of us, conversations surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) seem inescapable. For some others, the thought of “let me ask ChatGPT about this” has become routine. Seemingly, AI has filtered into our everyday lives, a scientific innovation with an indiscriminate impact on the way we conduct scientific research. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals with language processing and generation. Under this hierarchy, LLMs are a specific subset of NLP, which draws upon huge training datasets (of typically a billion parameters or more) to generate text, summarise and answer questions. Examples of commonly known LLMs include OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.5 or -4, Microsoft’s Bing Chat and Google’s Bard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As described in a recent </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06221-2"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> review, we are already seeing the multifaceted ways AI can be used to aid scientific discovery. From generating hypotheses to designing experiments, we have  barely scratched the surface of harnessing this versatile tool. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">While much of the discussion has covered the potential benefits AI may bring, we are increasingly seeing concerns about the risks AI may carry. Echoing the plot of a dystopian sci-fi, some news outlets have gone so far as to state that this technology may pose an </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65746524"><span style="font-weight: 400">existential threat to humankind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Parallel with the rising use of LLMs, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">scientific publishing and academia are not absent from this nervous discourse, with much of the discussion focused around the use of AI tools in generating paper publications and peer review reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Computer-assistance is not a novel concept in scientific publishing. Automated systems have long been integrated into the process to scan references, inspect manuscripts for plagiarism and check their compliance with journal policies. However, the capacity of AI to expand the volume and type of tasks that can be automated poses several risks that could disrupt the peer review system: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLM-generated ‘peer review’ reports are at risk of error: its ability to conflate different sources of information can lead to inaccurate and misleading information (LLM developers refer to this phenomenon as ‘hallucination’).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although a powerful tool for processing and summarising facts about the world, as their output is limited to the training data they are given, LLMs are not yet able to generate original information: this means that the produced reports may not necessarily be as critical as a human reviewer would be and are very rarely as insightful. They will also be subject to any biases inherent in the data they are fed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Developers and creators of LLMs are often not very transparent about how their models use and retain the prompts they receive, raising concerns about intellectual property and confidentiality. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">At a time when many academics already feel inundated with invitations to review a manuscript, LLMs are at risk of being misused by reviewers to rapidly generate poor quality, unhelpful reviews, thereby diminishing the value of the peer review process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such concerns have led some publishers and funding agencies such as the NIH </span><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-149.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">to ban the use of AI in the peer review process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. While these measures are expected and perhaps advisable as we come to better understand how to work with LLMs, we should not ignore their potential to help peer reviewers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">LLMs have the potential to support reviewers as writing assistants in assembling constructive and easily readable reports </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">With more than 90% of indexed scientific articles being published in English, English-speaking researchers are at an advantage in science communication, and the use of LLMs could help democratise peer review by allowing researchers who are not fluent English speakers to communicate science in English more effectively. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">While the risks of bias in LLM persist, the potential biases, judgments and subjectivity inherent in manual reviewing can be minimised by using these tools. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">A significant amount of research requires multidisciplinary scrutiny. LLMs could accelerate the assessment of aspects of papers that require significant time, energy and expertise (such as statistical validity)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a complementary tool to one&#8217;s own work, LLMs could expand on the existing human reviewers’ report by providing additional insights and context. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scientific peer review has long been considered the gold standard for ensuring the quality and credibility of research. A way of replicating the research-focused discussions between academics that formed the foundation for the critical yet open-minded approach that defines modern scientific discovery. The use of LLMs in the scientific review process may, to some, feel like the removal of the &#8216;peer&#8217; in peer review and, as such, a threat to science in its entirety. However, If used as a tool to assist the peer review process, rather than as a standalone “robot” reviewer, LLMs could enhance both the quality and efficiency of manuscript assessment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reaching this goal will require a concerted effort from all parties involved in the peer review process. Reviewers who use LLMs to assist with manuscript assessment must take responsibility for the accuracy and value of the reports they submit. Authors can use LLMs to help improve their work but should avoid the trap of assuming these imperfect tools can instantly create a complete manuscript. In turn, publishers must ensure that accountability across the peer review process remains in the hands of experienced human editors. Transparency and honesty about LLMs will be vital in shaping the policies that will help usher in their use.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“AI can bring efficiency to peer review by identifying plagiarism, sorting submissions, and assessing the quality of research. However, it might also lead to job loss for human reviewers, lack of nuanced understanding, and the risk of overlooking innovative but unconventional studies. Additionally, reliance on AI may increase the risk of hacking and manipulation of review outcomes.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; ChatGPT-4.0</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The text at the top of the article was generated by ChatGPT3.5 in response to a prompt asking about the future of peer review. The text above, which provides a considerably more cautious perspective on AI, was created by the next iteration of ChatGPT. LLMs are a technology developing at an incredible pace,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and opinions on its use are likely to shift just as rapidly. Science should strive to work with, rather than against or without AI whilst recognizing the complexity of the challenges it proposes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever these developments may bring, it is important that science maintains an attitude of critical open-mindedness and adaptability in the face of new tools and developments, like science always has. </span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brainless-jellyfish-eyes-nerves-learn">These brainless jellyfish use their eyes and bundles of nerves to learn</a></h4>

              
                <p>For Caribbean box jellyfish, learning is literally a no-brainer.</p>



<p>In a new experiment, these animals <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01136-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned to spot and avoid obstacles</a> despite having no central brain, researchers report September 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>. This is the first evidence that jellyfish can make mental connections between events — such as seeing something and running into it — and change their behavior accordingly.</p>



<p>“Maybe learning does not need a very complex nervous system, but rather, learning is an integral part of nerve cells, or very limited circuitry,” says Jan Bielecki, a neuroethologist at Kiel University in Germany. If so, the new finding could help trace how learning evolved in animals.</p>





<p>The nervous system of a Caribbean box jellyfish (<em>Tripedalia cystophora</em>) includes four knoblike rhopalia that dangle off the bell of its body. Each rhopalium houses six eyes and about 1,000 neurons. The jellyfish use their vision to help steer between mangrove roots in the tropical lagoons where they hunt tiny crustacean prey.</p>



<p>Weaving between roots is no simple feat. Caribbean box jellyfish judge a root’s distance based on how dark it appears relative to surrounding water — that is, its contrast. In clear waters, only distant roots fade into the background, or have low contrast. But in murky waters, even nearby roots can blend into their surroundings.</p>



<p>Waters can become murky quickly due to tides, algae and other factors. Bielecki and his colleagues wondered if Caribbean box jellyfish could learn that low-contrast objects, which might at first seem distant, were actually close by.</p>



<p>The team put 12 jellyfish into a round tank surrounded by low-contrast, alternating gray and white stripes. A camera filmed the animals’ behavior for about seven minutes. At first, the jellyfish seemed to interpret the gray stripes as distant roots and swam into the tank wall.</p>



<p>But those collisions seemed to lead the jellyfish to treat the gray stripes more like close roots in murky water, and the animals started avoiding them. The jellies’ average distance from the tank wall increased from about 2.5 centimeters in the first couple of minutes to about 3.6 centimeters in the final couple of minutes. Their average bumps into the wall dropped from 1.8 per minute to 0.78 per minute.</p>



<p>“I found that really amazing,” says Nagayasu Nakanishi, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, who has studied jellyfish nervous systems but was not involved in the new work. “I never thought that jellyfish could really learn.”</p>

<p>Neurobiologist Björn Brembs views the results more cautiously, noting the small number of jellyfish tested and the variability in their performance. “I want this to be true, as it would be so very cool,” says Brembs, of the University of Regensburg in Germany. Experiments with more jellyfish could convince him that the animals really do learn.</p>



<p>In other experiments, Bielecki and his colleagues snipped rhopalia off jellyfish and placed those eye-bearing nerve bundles in front of a screen. Sort of like that scene in <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, Bielecki says, except jellyfish eyes don’t have eyelids to hold open. The screen displayed low-contrast, light gray bars, while an electrode gave the rhopalia a weak electrical pulse, which mimicked the sensation of bumping into something.</p>



<p>This training caused the rhopalia to start responding to low-contrast bars that they had initially ignored. They started sending out the types of neural signals they are known to emit when a jellyfish darts away from an obstacle. This suggests that rhopalia alone can learn that seemingly distant, low-contrast obstacles are actually close enough to avoid — which, in turn, hints that the rhopalia are the Caribbean box jellyfish’s learning centers.</p>





<p>“That’s the coolest part of the paper,” says Ken Cheng, a behavioral biologist at Macquarie University in Sydney. “That gets us one step down into the, you know, wiring of how it works.”</p>



<p>For neurobiologist Gaëlle Botton-Amiot, tracing learning to the rhopalia raises new questions. “They have four of these things in their bodies, so how does that work?” she asks. “How is this coordinated?” And if a jellyfish loses one of its rhopalia, does it forget everything those eyes saw and neurons learned? Or do the other rhopalia remember it?</p>



<p>Botton-Amiot’s research at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220685120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints at similar learning abilities in sea anemones</a>. Like jellyfish, they belong to a group of animals called cnidarians. “Showing that cnidarians that are so different [can both learn] means that it’s probably super widespread within them,” she says, and that perhaps their common ancestor could learn too.</p>



<p>“Maybe [learning] actually evolved multiple times in the evolution of nervous systems,” Nakanishi says. Uncovering the cellular and chemical machinery behind learning in jellyfish or other animals could shed light on this. “If there’s a lot of similarities in the mechanism of how they learn, then that would be suggestive of common ancestry,” he says. “But if they evolved independently, then you would perhaps expect very different mechanisms of learning.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx has returned bits of the asteroid Bennu to Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Seven years is a long time to wait for your carrier service to deliver a package. That’s how long it’s been since <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/osiris-rex/in-depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft</a> set off to gather rocks and dust from the asteroid Bennu. But the package has now been safely delivered.</p>



<p>On September 24, the spacecraft flew near Earth and dropped off a capsule containing material <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">collected from Bennu</a> in October 2020 (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>This is the third mission to retrieve bits of an asteroid, and the first for NASA and the United States. The amount of asteroid material onboard this time far exceeds the micrograms that Japan’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/hayabusa-asteroid-sample-return-mission-lands-australia">Hayabusa spacecraft returned in 2005</a>, from the asteroid Itokawa, and the five grams that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">Hayabusa2 collected in 2018</a> from Ryugu (<em>SN: 6/14/10; SN: 12/7/20</em>).</p>





<p>The Bennu sample arrived with a timing and precision that would make most terrestrial delivery services jealous. After a three-year journey back from the asteroid and an initially scorching descent, the capsule released a parachute and descended to its destination at Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, Utah, touching down a few minutes earlier than scheduled at 10:52 a.m. EDT.</p>



<p>“This is a huge deal,” said NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Chief Scientist James Garvin, who was at the air force base to witness the capsule’s landing. “This is the rarest stuff we&#8217;ve ever had on Earth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The capsule will travel on to the Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston on September 25 before the sample canister is opened. </p>



<p>If the asteroid bits survived the descent, they could help reveal what sort of materials came together to build our solar system. Getting a good look at the stuff that Bennu is made of could also provide insights into the risks that nearby asteroids pose to us, in the event that they are on a collision course with Earth. The asteroid cargo may even hold clues to help answer one of the biggest questions in science — how did life begin?</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m really focused on … trying to understand if these kinds of carbon-rich asteroids may have delivered the seeds of life,” says planetary scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who leads the OSIRIS-REx mission. “So we&#8217;re looking for things like amino acids, which are in our proteins, and nucleic acids,” the building blocks of the genetic instructions that make life possible on Earth.</p>



<p>Lauretta says there’s essentially no chance of finding anything alive on asteroids like Bennu. But in the collected rocks and dust, “we could really see how organic molecular chemistry can evolve before life shows up.”</p>

<p>At an estimated 250 grams, the asteroid sample in the OSIRIS-REx return capsule is just a bit heavier than a cup of coffee. But it is a huge cache of asteroid material, as far as mission scientists are concerned. The sample size far exceeds the quantity initially hoped for, Lauretta says.</p>



<p>“We came up with 15 grams” as a reasonable sample size to analyze, he says, “which is an enormous amount of material in analytical chemistry these days.” But NASA allows Lauretta and his team to keep only a quarter of the sample for their own use. Some of the remaining portion will be distributed to scientists around the globe, with the rest reserved for future studies.</p>



<p>That meant collecting 60 grams from Bennu would have been enough to ensure that Lauretta and his colleagues had their hoped-for sample. “The fact that we got over four times that is just phenomenally successful,” Lauretta says.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Recipe for an asteroid</h4>



<p>Researchers are already envisioning all they can learn from Bennu.</p>



<p>Physicist Mikael Granvik of the University of Helsinki hopes analyses of the Bennu material will help reveal the potential for mining asteroids for water and raw materials that could supply future space missions.</p>



<p>The asteroid bits could also aid his investigations of how fragile some space rocks might be. “What happens to asteroids of the same type as Bennu when they get closer to the sun?” says Granvik, who is not a member of the OSIRIS-REx team. &nbsp;He and his colleagues propose that the interaction with the sun causes such “rubble pile asteroids,” made of loosely bound material, to break apart. The hypothesis could explain why there are fewer rubble pile asteroids in orbits near the sun than expected.</p>



<p>To test the idea, Granvik exposes samples to harsh conditions that approximate what it would be like near the sun, basically destroying the material. For that reason, he doesn’t expect to use any of the precious Bennu rock. Instead, Granvik hopes to learn the Bennu asteroid recipe and then order up asteroid analogs from suppliers who will blend together materials mimicking the Bennu mix. It’s an example of how the returned sample could expand research opportunities even for scientists who don’t get a share of the real thing.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After a three-year trip aboard the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, a capsule containing dust and rocks from the asteroid Bennu will make a fiery plunge into the Earth’s atmosphere on September 24, as seen in this simulation. Once it releases the capsule, OSIRIS-REx will fire its jets to deflect itself onward to asteroid Apophis under the new name OSIRIS-APEX. Meanwhile, the capsule will fly toward Earth like a fireball. Although jostled during the rough descent, the sample will be protected from the intense temperatures of reentry by the capsule&#8217;s heat shield. As the capsule nears the ground, it will pop a parachute and gently drift the rest of the way down in Utah where, if all goes well, scientists can collect their long-awaited delivery.</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stories Bennu can tell</h4>



<p>For planetary scientist Jessica Sunshine of the University of Maryland in College Park, much of the value in sample return missions is in stories asteroids can tell us about the formation of the Earth and solar system.&nbsp;“We think of them as sort of dead rocks, and they&#8217;re not. I mean, they have undergone significant evolution, both chemical and physical in the 4.5 billion years since they formed,” Sunshine says.</p>



<p>Like Lauretta, Sunshine hopes to learn how those processes ultimately led to the origins of life, but studying near-Earth asteroids is crucial for understanding the threats asteroids pose as well. “In principle, they could have given us life and they could take it away,” Sunshine says, “I mean, from the dinosaur&#8217;s perspective, they did take it away.”</p>



<p>Sunshine is member of the team that sent the DART spacecraft to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">nudge asteroid Dimorphos</a> into a new orbit to see if it was possible to push asteroids off courses that threaten Earth (<em>SN: 10/11/22</em>). &nbsp;“If you&#8217;re worried about the asteroid hazard problem, we pretty much better understand what is the physical and compositional variability of all these things that might hit us,” Sunshine says. “Because depending on what they&#8217;re made of and how they&#8217;re made, it&#8217;s going to change their effect when they hit us. If they ever hit us.”</p>



<p>There may be more than bits of just Bennu in the return capsule, says astronomer Humberto Campins of the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who is a member of the OSIRIS-REx team. Some highly reflective boulders on Bennu don’t match the rest of the asteroid, which is very dark. The most likely reason, Campins says, is that the bright chunks come from collisions with other asteroids.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s no guarantee, but I&#8217;m hoping that in our sample there will be some fraction, some pieces, grains that come from those other asteroids,” Campins say. Remote analyses suggest that some of the bright pieces on Bennu are a good match for the asteroid Vesta. “So we would have a sample return not just from Bennu, but from possibly from Vesta,” Campins says, “or who knows what other asteroid.”</p>



<p>Though this will be NASA’s first sample return of an asteroid, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-nabbed-spacecraft-may-be-outside-solar-system">the Stardust mission</a> in 2006 successfully returned samples of comet Wild-2, also to Utah (<em>SN: 8/14/14</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Next stop: Asteroid Apophis</h4>



<p>OSIRIS-REx’s mission doesn’t end with the package delivery in Utah. “The spacecraft is still healthy,” Lauretta says. After firing a deflection maneuver, “it’s on a route to another asteroid — Asteroid Apophis,” which is about as far away from Earth as Bennu is.</p>



<p>For the extended mission, the satellite gets a new name, OSIRIS-APEX, and is set to orbit Apophis once it arrives in April of 2029, if everything goes to plan. But it won’t be bringing any more samples back to Earth. Unlike your local delivery trucks, OSIRIS-REx was designed to carry only one package and make a single delivery. After Sunday, the spacecraft’s delivery days are done.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouth-taping-trend-sleep-science-slim">Mouth taping may be a trending sleep hack, but the science behind it is slim</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maybe TikTok showed you people putting a little tape on their lips. Or maybe Instagram served you ads for sticky mouth strips. On social media and beyond, a trend called mouth taping is keeping people’s mouths shut at night — helping them breathe through their nose.</p>



<p>Zack Ford, age 38, first tried the trend last month, after recovering from surgery for a deviated septum. Surgery improved his nasal breathing, but at night, he was still sucking air through his lips. In the mornings, Ford says, he’d wake up with a dry mouth and a scratchy throat.</p>





<p>Ford brought up mouth taping during an appointment with his doctor, who didn’t think there was harm in trying. That evening, Ford placed a small square of surgical tape over the middle of his lips and settled into bed. It was the best night’s sleep he’s had in recent memory, he says. “When I woke up, I was like, ‘Holy shit this works!’”</p>



<p>Mouth taping’s benefits have been touted for everything from the dental to the somnial. People may seal their mouths shut to prevent teeth grinding, bad breath, snoring and sleep apnea — or even to boost fitness&nbsp;or get a stronger jaw.</p>



<p>But there’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-023-6039-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little data yet to support such claims</a>, dentist Jonathan Quigley wrote in a June 23 letter in the <em>British Dental Journal.</em> Before advising patients, Quigley, who works at a dental clinic in England, would like to see more studies and have a better understanding of the potential risks and benefits.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Could taping the mouth improve people’s sleep?</h4>



<p>Some evidence suggests that mouth taping may have merit for helping treat at least one ailment: sleep apnea. Even here, though, the science is skimpy, and the methods are varied. From a thin strip on the lips to a black patch across the mouth, tape types and techniques can differ between people, brands and studies, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions.</p>



<p>Though popularized recently via social media and the 2020 book <em>Breath</em>, the idea of using a device to keep one’s mouth shut while sleeping isn’t all that new. For years, doctors have used chin straps to help some sleep apnea patients keep their mouths closed during continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP treatment, says Krishna Sundar, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine doctor who directs the Sleep-Wake Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People with the condition can have trouble breathing while asleep: muscles relax, the tongue flops back and soft tissues in the throat collapse, blocking the airway. CPAP is the gold standard treatment. The machine delivers air pressure via a mask worn on the face. It’s kind of like pumping up a tire, Sundar says. Turn it on, and the floppy airway inflates. If masks cover only the nose, though, air can leak out the mouth. Chin straps can keep the mouth closed and prevent air leakage. But they don’t work all that well and some people find them uncomfortable, Sundar says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="677" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-677x450.jpg" alt="A photo of a white man lying in bed with a CPAP machine strapped to his head and covering his nose." class="wp-image-3131598" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/091523_MR_mouth-taping_chin-strap_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131598">One treatment for sleep apnea is a CPAP machine, which pumps air into the nose via a face mask. Doctors sometimes pair it with a chin strap to prevent air from venting out the mouth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131598">Alina555/E+/Getty Images Plus</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In sleep studies in his lab, if a person treated with CPAP is venting air through the mouth, Sundar&#8217;s team will stick a tiny strip of tape down their lips to keep them closed. “This teensy tape seems to do the job better than a big chin strap,” he says. It makes the CPAP more effective, which can help people get a better night’s sleep. Sundar calls mouth tape one of the tools in doctors’ tool kits, though he would like to see more data on how well it works.</p>



<p>One effect sleep medicine specialist Andrew Wellman has noticed is that, with people’s lips stuck together, air pumped into their noses sometimes flows into their mouths and puffs out their cheeks. “They look like they’re blowing into a saxophone,” says Wellman, of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Other scientists have also observed this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9992075/#CR16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“mouth puffing” phenomenon</a>, though Wellman’s team doesn’t yet know how it affects sleep apnea. It’s not dangerous, he says, but it might wake you up.</p>





<p>He and his colleagues have combined mouth taping not only with CPAP, but also with a mandibular advancement device for treating the disorder. The device slips into the mouth like a mouthguard and pushes the lower jaw forward, pulling the tongue off the back of the throat. But the device can cause people to breathe through their mouths, potentially rendering the treatment less effective, Wellman says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202109-1050OC?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a study of 21 people with sleep apnea,</a> Wellman’s team covered participants’ lips with clear adhesive strips made by SomniFix, a Maryland manufacturing company that supported the work. Combining the strips with the mouthguard-like device offered an improvement over the device alone, reducing the number of times people stopped breathing per hour, Wellman’s team reported in 2022. It was “a small improvement,” he points out. “We need a bigger study.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bigger trials are needed to test mouth taping’s efficacy</h4>



<p>That seems to be a common denominator of mouth taping research to date. It’s all small preliminary studies, Wellman says. “We don’t have the large clinical trials … that’s what’s missing.”</p>



<p>A 2015 study found that just a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25450408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porous patch on the mouth alone helped treat mild sleep apnea and snoring</a>. And <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9498537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study last year on a different kind of tape</a> reported something similar. But these studies were tiny, with just 30 participants or less. The lack of data from larger trials means that experts’ opinions on mouth taping may be all over the map, Wellman says. “When you ask a doctor about it, you’re going to get all different answers,” he says.</p>



<p>Ear, nose and throat specialist Erich Voigt, for one, isn’t convinced mouth taping is beneficial — or even safe. The trend “definitely raises a few red flags,” says Voigt, of NYU Langone Health. He’s concerned people may impede their breathing or accidentally inhale the tape and choke, though no large studies have tracked this yet.</p>



<p>Mouth taping might be worthwhile in the right scenario, Voigt says, but he advises a cautious approach for anyone trying a new health fad from TikTok. “It&#8217;s probably a good idea [for people] to talk about it with their health care provider before just doing it themselves.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the first part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression.</em></p>
</div>



<p><em>[Content warning: This story contains discussion of suicide.]</em></p>



<p>On a hot, sunny Sunday afternoon in Manhattan, time froze for Jon Nelson. He stood on the sidewalk and said good-bye to his three kids, whose grandfather had come into the city from Long Island to pick them up.</p>



<p>Like any parent, Jon is deeply attuned to his children’s quirks. His oldest? Sometimes quiet but bitingly funny. His middle kid? Rates dad a 10 out of 10 on the embarrassment scale and doesn’t need a hug. His 10-year-old son, the baby of the family, is the emotional one. “My youngest son would climb back up into my wife’s womb if he could,” Jon says. “He’s that kid.”</p>





<p>An unexpected parade had snarled traffic, so Jon parked illegally along a yellow curb on 36th Street, near where his father-in-law was waiting. It was time to go. His youngest gave the last hug. “He looked up, scared and sad,” Jon says, and asked, “Dad, am I going to see you again?”</p>



<p>That question stopped the clock. “I was like, ‘Oh man,’” Jon says. “It was one of those moments where I was living it through his eyes. And I got scared for the first time.”</p>



<p>Until that good-bye, Jon hadn’t wanted to live. For years, he had a constant yearning to die — he talks about it like it was an addiction — as he fought deep, debilitating depression. But his son’s question pierced through that heaviness and reached something inside him. “That was the first time I really thought about it. I was like, ‘I kind of hope I don’t die.’ I hadn’t had that feeling in so long.”</p>



<p>That hug happened around 5 p.m. on August 21, 2022. Twelve hours later, Jon was wheeled into a surgical suite.</p>



<p>There, at Mount Sinai’s hospital just southwest of Central Park, surgery team members screwed Jon’s head into a frame to hold it still. Then they numbed him and drilled two small holes through the top of his skull, one on each side. Through each hole, a surgeon plunged a long, thin wire dotted at the end with electrodes deep into his brain. The wiring, threaded under his skin, snaked around the outside of Jon’s skull and sank down behind his ear. From there, a wire wrapped around to the front, meeting a battery-powered control box that surgeons implanted in his chest, just below his collarbone.</p>



<p>During the surgery and in the days after, doctors sent small pulses of electricity into Jon’s brain. In ways that are still unclear, this electrical tinkering changes the messages that move between different brain regions. The doctors and researchers had what seems like a bold goal: They wanted these pulses to pull Jon out of the darkness of depression.</p>



<p>Jon is one of dozens of people in the United States currently in clinical trials that aim to heal mental disorders with brain implants. The technique is called deep brain stimulation, and it’s built on the scientific premise that electrical stimulation can reset brains that are in the grip of powerful and devastating psychiatric disorders <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">such as depression</a>, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch a video of Jon describing his depression, his experience with DBS and how his mental health affects his family.</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing deep brain stimulation</h4>



<p>I first heard about deep brain stimulation, or DBS, more than a decade ago, in 2010. As a science reporter, I was sitting in a cavernous conference room packed with neuroscientists in San Diego. We were listening to a presentation by <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/helen-s-mayberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Mayberg, a neurologist and neuroscientist</a> who was then at Emory University in Atlanta. As she spoke, Mayberg walked the audience through the scientific rationale for the idea that electrodes pushed down into the brain could alleviate severe depression.</p>





<p>Toward the end of her presentation, Mayberg showed a video of a woman who had severe depression. The day before the video was taken, doctors had implanted electrodes into the woman’s brain. The researchers in the video turned on the stimulation, and within a minute, just like that, the woman wanted to smile and laugh. That transformation floored me, and judging by the audience reaction, a lot of other people too.</p>



<p>In November of 2022, I caught up with Mayberg, again at a neuroscience meeting, again in San Diego. We talked about what had happened in the years since that presentation and where this research is going. It hasn’t been an easy road, says Mayberg, who now directs the Nash Family Center for Advanced Circuit Therapeutics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The science of DBS has taken lots of twists and turns.</p>



<p>So have the journeys of people who have participated in this research. To hear one of those stories, Mayberg put me in touch with Jon.</p>



<p>For this series, I talked with him and his wife, as well as three other people who had lived with severe depression and are now being treated with deep brain stimulation. These people’s paths have been incredibly tough. And while they still face challenges, they have been crystal clear about what DBS has done for them: This experimental brain surgery has given them back their lives.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The darkness of depression</h4>



<p>Jon’s a sharp, funny middle-aged guy, a self-described “character,” who lives in a picturesque small town northeast of Philadelphia. He’s a dad with three busy kids and a garage packed with hockey sticks, softball catcher pads, golf clubs, balls of all sorts, bikes, in-line skates, a mesh goal and a supercute white motor scooter. He’s a coach (hockey and softball) known for dispensing “isms” and the phrase, “I’m going to give you some life advice.” He’s a husband who worries about his wife doing too much and not taking care of herself. He’s in advertising, a people person who used to love having his friends over to hang around his fire pit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a decade, Jon let his outgoing personality carry him as he struggled to overcome his depression. His disease, and the suicidal thoughts it forced on him, grew worse in the last five years. On the outside, Jon was the hypersocial, high-functioning guy everyone expected him to be. But inside, his profound depression was a private hell, he says. “I’d be the one standing in front of everybody leading a champagne toast, and then I’d be driving home and wanting to slam my car into a tree.”</p>



<p>Jon fantasized about other deaths: A mugging, a plane crash. Until Jon’s son asked if he would see Jon again, on the evening before the procedure, Jon even nurtured a little bit of hope that he might die during the brain surgery he volunteered for.</p>



<p>Jon’s depression also stole his motivation, leaving him wrung out and isolated from his family. He overate, overslept and drank too much. His worst stretches, he suspects, left his family traumatized.</p>



<p>Talk therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, ketamine, cannabis, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snap-crackle-and-feel-good">transcranial magnetic stimulation</a> (in which magnetic fields target nerve cells through the skull), several residential treatment stints, even electroconvulsive therapy, which left him with intense memory loss — none of these treatments reliably worked for him.</p>



<p>An estimated 280 million people worldwide have major depression. A subset of that giant number will ultimately fall into a hopeless-sounding diagnosis: “treatment-resistant depression” or “intractable depression.” In the United States, an estimated 2.8 million people have that diagnosis.</p>



<p>Jon is one of them. For him and his family, deep brain stimulation was a last-ditch, desperate maneuver. It was his Hail Mary.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the second part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p><em>[Content note: This story contains discussion of suicide.]</em></p>



<p>Jon Nelson’s depression was poison. “I had poison in every single bit of my body. It literally ran throughout every cell in my body. My blood carried the poison, and it crushed everything in me.”</p>



<p>Melancholia, one of depression’s early names, comes from the ancient Greek word for “black bile,” a diseased liquid believed to flood a body. It was once thought that bloodletting and other ways to let the corrupting fluids out could ease people’s minds.</p>





<p>Today, doctors have much better options to treat depression. Antidepressant drugs and talk therapy can be effective for many people. But these options don’t help everyone.</p>



<p>Jon has treatment-resistant depression. So does Amanda, an app and web designer and artist in her 30s who lives in New York City. Amanda can also rattle off a long list of therapies she has tried for the deep depression she’s felt since she was 13. She has been on 21 different antidepressant drugs. Her brain has been zapped with powerful magnets in a therapy called transcranial magnetic stimulation. She has had IV infusions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ketamine-new-nerve-cell-connections-mice-depression">ketamine</a>.</p>

Her art, including depictions of “Cartoon Amanda,” became an escape.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131335">Courtesy of Amanda</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Amanda, who to protect her privacy requested her last name not be used, has also had 40 rounds of electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT. The “gold standard” treatment for people who aren’t helped by other therapies, ECT is often done several times a week for three or four weeks. For unknown reasons, the resulting mini-seizures in the brain can sometimes provide relief.</p>



<p>“The electroconvulsive therapy helped a little bit,” Amanda says. “But for it to help, I had to do it so frequently that I got memory damage. I was like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don’t remember where my sock drawer is. I don’t remember what subway stations are near my apartment. I don’t remember how to use the software I’ve been using for 10 years,’” she told me. “I have to stop.”</p>



<p>Jon’s depression was poison; Amanda’s was a vortex. And when ECT was no longer an option, that vortex nearly consumed her. After a suicide attempt, she spent six weeks in the hospital and then another six weeks receiving outpatient care. “It was at that point that [doctors] were like, ‘There’s nothing else we can do for you. You’ve tried literally everything that’s out there. If ECT doesn’t work, that’s it,’” Amanda says.</p>



<p>As with Jon and others I talked with, her doctors had given up, Amanda says. “When you get to that place where they say there’s nothing else we can do for you, and yet you have to keep living your life, that’s a hard place to get to.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The last hope</h4>



<p>Desperate for help, Amanda called the <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/care/psychiatry/services/depression-anxiety-disorders/trd-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment-resistant depression program at Mount Sinai</a>. After describing all of her unsuccessful treatments, Amanda was once again passed along to different doctors. “They had decided that you really have tried everything,” she says.</p>



<p>That last handoff is what delivered Amanda to the DBS research program. As Martijn Figee, a psychiatrist and DBS researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, explained the procedure, the research and the risks, Amanda listened carefully. She arrived at appointments prepared with an eight-page-long list of questions that covered the practical (“What should I avoid forever once I have it? Running? Hanging my head upside down? Trampolines?”) and the profound (“What makes a person want to be alive?”). Questions answered and fully informed, Amanda agreed to have DBS surgery.</p>





<p>The DBS program that Amanda and Jon are a part of looks vastly different from earlier iterations. In 2008, neurologist Helen Mayberg and many colleagues around the country had just begun a large, double-blind DBS clinical trial to test the technique. Called the Broaden trial, the six-month study followed people with depression, some of whom had electrical stimulation on and others who were implanted with electrodes but had the stimulation off.</p>



<p>All told, 90 people with severe depression were implanted with brain stimulation devices in the trial. But in 2013, testing stopped early because of poorer-than-expected results. The sponsor and maker of the DBS device, St. Jude Medical Inc., determined that the trial wasn’t likely to hit its goals. Along with another unsuccessful trial, which included 30 people who received stimulation in a different part of the brain, those lackluster results represented a real setback for DBS as a treatment for depression.</p>



<p>Those disappointing findings fueled criticisms of the method, underscored by stories of people who had negative experiences with DBS. And potential conflicts of interest exist, as they do for many medical treatments that depend on medical device companies. Mayberg, for instance, receives fees for consulting and licensing intellectual property from Abbott Laboratories, the company that bought St. Jude Medical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite setbacks and criticism though, the research didn’t stop; it matured. Brain-imaging methods got better, allowing researchers to see exactly which highways of white matter fibers, message-sending bundles that emanate from nerve cells, are influenced by the electrodes. Other aspects of care, including follow-up sessions with mental health experts and therapists, have evolved. In a small trial of 11 people with severe depression, for instance, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28397839/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine had their symptoms improve</a>, researchers reported in 2018. And DBS as a depression treatment has been able to borrow heavily from progress in treating other disorders.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch a video of Amanda describing how she uses art to process her experience with intense depression and DBS.</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How widespread is DBS?</h4>



<p>Globally, DBS electrodes have been implanted in an estimated 230,000 people’s brains. DBS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1997 to treat tremor, and in 2002 to treat Parkinson’s disease. DBS is also used by doctors for severe cases of epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder and dystonia, or involuntary muscle contractions.</p>



<p>DBS’s reach is expanding fast. In smaller experimental trials, people have been implanted with electrodes for pain, eating disorders, addiction, traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Researchers are working on stimulation systems to restore movement to paralyzed people and speech to people unable to talk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jon heard about the procedure in 2021. He called the Mount Sinai program from a residential treatment facility, only to learn that he didn’t qualify because, at the time, he hadn’t yet tried ECT. So he did 12 rounds of the therapy in early 2022. ECT helps many people. But it didn’t help Jon, and the experience shook him. “It was horrific. Zero relief. My memory loss is still pervasive to this day,” he says. It was utter misery, but he qualified for the DBS trial.</p>



<p>And with that, Jon’s surgery date was set: August 22, 2022.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the surgery, Jon’s wife, Barbara, worried about both the surgery and the outcome. “What if they slip or they sneeze and they ruin his brain?” she recalls wondering. “What if it doesn’t work? What do we do next? This was so much like the last resort that if it didn’t work, then we were going to be looking at potentially years more of trying.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She adds, “And there’s no option of giving up.”</p>



<p>Even so, Barbara didn’t fully believe the surgery was going to happen until it was right around the corner. “I think my brain just did not catch up to the reality of it until we were very close to the actual surgery,” she told me. “A couple of days before, I was like, ‘Oh I’m a mess.’ I do weird things when I’m really that stressed out, rearranging furniture, doing things that seem to take too much energy.”</p>



<p>Jon, however, was not worried. “I didn’t care that I was having my head cut open,” he says. “I had the same level of anxiety that you would have if you were getting your teeth cleaned.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the third part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p>Early in the morning on August 22, 2022, Jon’s medical team told him that neurologist Helen Mayberg would check in with him just before his deep brain stimulation surgery. “Everybody is like, ‘Dr. Mayberg is going to come in and give you a pumped-up speech.’” She’d explain how everything ought to go and what the team needed from Jon. She didn’t disappoint, Jon says. “She came in and gave me the pep talk: ‘All I need you to do is to be present,’” she told him. “She was really adamant about that.”</p>





<p>In the middle of the surgery, the medical team woke Jon up from anesthesia. It was a hazy time, but Jon remembers it. “I’m so awake, and I was so myself,” he recalls. “Dr. Mayberg is right in your face right away, and she’s like, ‘Jon, it’s Dr. Mayberg and Dr. Figee.’ And I said, ‘Doc, I need to tell you something.’ And she was so concerned, like, ‘Yes, yes, yes?’ And I was like, ‘I’m present!’</p>



<p>“I’m just busting her chops, and she’s sitting there laughing. But that’s how completely normal you are.”</p>



<p>The day after surgery, Jon sat with Mayberg and another clinician as they began to turn on and off electrodes, searching for the pattern of stimulation that would influence nerve cells in the right way and in the right spot. Each time, Mayberg would ask him two key questions: Did he feel like walking his dog? And did he want to have friends over to sit around his fire pit? Jon’s wife, Barbara, his dad and a crowd of doctors and researchers watched a video feed of this process from an overflow room.</p>



<p>After trying a series of stimulation patterns and getting “yes” to their questions, the researchers settled on an electrical pattern, and Jon went home to Pennsylvania. “The next day, bandaged up on my head, I not only took the dog on a walk, I asked my son and my wife to come with me. I enjoyed the walk. I enjoyed the conversation. I enjoyed coming back home. I sat outside and had coffee. It’s just surreal.”</p>



<p>As we talk, about six months after his surgery, Jon has no doubt about the outcome: “Instantaneously overnight I was healed,” he says. “I have been in remission from depression since the moment they turned that on.”</p>



<p>Barbara, Jon’s wife, has seen the shift from the outside. His motivation is back, she says. He’s not as fidgety as he was. He’s easier to talk to. He cooks elaborate dinners for the family. He even looks different. When he is sick, Jon has a clammy, pale, almost puffy look to him, Barbara says. “I haven’t seen that look in six months, which is amazing,” she says. “He just looks healthier.</p>



<p>“He has the old Jon voice back. He annoys me more,” she says. “He’s a super high-energy, outgoing person, and I’m the quiet, withdrawn person who needs more time alone. I’m like, ‘Oh my God, would you just stop talking?’ That’s a good thing, though, that’s a good thing, because for a long time, he didn’t want to talk at all.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Barbara and Jon got together in their early 20s, she thought Jon was the happiest and nicest person she had ever met. Now, “the person I met 20-something years ago is back,” she says. “I feel like he was lost for a long time.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Changes after DBS</h4>



<p>Jon has no shortage of words to describe his recovery.</p>





<p>Amanda, the artist in New York City, who had DBS surgery on October 20, 2022, has trouble describing the immediate change. “Maybe it was like a little spark of energy. I was more chatty. It was easier to talk to people, just because it felt like there was a little something inside pushing.”</p>



<p>Like Jon, her recovery has been incredibly fast. “I left the hospital on a Friday,” Amanda recalls. “By Sunday, I could tell it was working. By Wednesday … that’s when I got completely better.</p>



<p>“I can’t even describe the relief. I’ve never felt relief so profound in my life,” she says. “You get used to living in pain. And when the pain is all of a sudden gone, you’re like, ‘What is this?’”</p>



<p>Part of her life now includes what she calls “weird experiences” — taking pleasure in things. Candles, for instance. “I never enjoyed smells before. And now I have these candles, and they smell so good. Candles never smelled good before.”</p>



<p>A similar sentiment comes from Emily Hollenbeck, who also lives in New York City and had DBS surgery in 2021, about a year and a half before I spoke with her. When a certain pattern of brain stimulation was turned on during the surgery, she started to think about bacon. “I was tasting the bacon in my mind. I could taste that salt and the fat and the crispiness. I started to feel that sense of hunger.”</p>



<p>Her depression had taken away any anticipation of upcoming pleasure. “My mouth won’t water,” she says. “I won’t really think about it.” With the stimulation, the contrast between disinterest and intense craving was “so immediate and so strong,” she says. “That’s why it struck me.” In the days after the surgery, she also noticed she began to feel restless, like she wanted to go to the library. “I had these impulses to move, to do things, to enjoy things,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What brain areas does DBS hit?</h4>



<p>Jon, Amanda and Emily have been receiving constant brain stimulation targeted to a brain area called the subcallosal cingulate, or SCC. That’s the same area that was targeted in the Broaden clinical trial, which was stopped prematurely because of poor early results.</p>



<p>So, what’s different now?</p>



<p>Since Broaden, and armed with better brain-imaging techniques, scientists have learned a lot more about the SCC and how it connects to other parts of the brain. The area is not a uniform glob of brain tissue; it holds a confluence of diverse white matter tracts, nerve bundles that speed information to and fro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A recent presentation from Mayberg’s research group described the outcomes of about 50 patients from the Broaden trial, people who continued to be stimulated and monitored after the trial officially ended. It turns out that the people who got better had their electrodes implanted in a fortuitous spot in the SCC, one that hit four key white matter tracts. “It was really about targeting,” Mayberg says.</p>



<p>The SCC — and the signals it sends to other brain areas — seems to have a role in generating negative emotions, immobility, cognitive sluggishness and heavy physical feelings. Stimulating there, researchers suspect, can overwhelm those nerve cells, tiring them out and making them effectively fall silent. That silence then has ripple effects at many different levels, from single cells to entire cohorts of brain areas. Those changes, the thinking goes, somehow turn down the negative malaise.</p>



<p>It’s a bit like taking off the parking brake, allowing energy and motivation to flow once more. This aspect of the SCC’s job may explain why Jon went for a walk in the hospital halls and at home with his family, why Amanda felt a spark of energy and why Emily had an itch to get up and go to the library.</p>

The subcallosal cingulum (left) and the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (right) are two current targets.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131441">S.A. Sheth and H.S. Mayberg/<em>Annual Review of Neuroscience</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But Mayberg and her colleagues at Mount Sinai aren’t the only people conducting trials on DBS for depression, nor is their target the only one under consideration. Another promising target, called the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, or VC/VS, is more involved in feelings of reward. Stimulating there may be turning up the positive as opposed to dialing down the negative. Its connections to other brain regions are extensive, perhaps even more numerous than the SCC’s.</p>



<p>Some of the big questions, says Sameer Sheth, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, are about personalizing the technique: Which patients would benefit from which target in the brain and what type of stimulation? The SCC and the VC/VS both seem promising. In a way, the debate mirrors a similar one in DBS for Parkinson’s disease, where several brain structures are possible targets. To determine where electrodes should be implanted, doctors now consider factors like how advanced the disease is, whether a patient needs to reduce their medication and if tremor is the main problem.</p>



<p>To better understand the neural circuits related to mood, Sheth and his colleagues are conducting a clinical trial for depression that is using implanted electrodes to listen in on many parts of the brain. The study is designed, in part, to uncover how various types of stimulation, pointed toward various neural spots, affect the brain. Eventually, the team hopes, this knowledge could lead to personalized stimulation — bespoke electrical patterns tailored to each person. (Sheth has received consulting fees from various medical companies, including Boston Scientific and NeuroPace, and cofounded a neurotechnology company.)</p>



<p>I talked with one of the people in this trial, a man who wanted to remain anonymous. He was the first person to undergo this massive brain eavesdropping effort by Sheth and colleagues. As such, he became Patient 001, a designation he grew fond of, he says. He traveled to Houston from New York City, where he was living at the time, and was scheduled for surgery on March 9, 2020. His surgery squeaked through, just days before all nonemergency surgeries were canceled in the area because of the growing COVID pandemic.</p>



<p>During surgery at Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center in Houston, Patient 001 was implanted with four electrode wires, two in the SCC and two in the VC/VS. He got 10 extra electrodes, too, implanted in areas connected to the SCC and VC/VS. These extras were temporary, there only to listen to his brain activity over a 10-day stay in the hospital. “I’m not going to say the 10-day stay in the hospital was a walk in the park, because it wasn’t,” he says. “But when you have nothing to lose and you’re in hell, you’ll do anything.”</p>



<p>Like Jon, Patient 001 went through a similar testing phase with his electrodes. At one point, he felt something big. “I said, ‘I don’t know what you did, but it feels like I’m online again. I’m online.’ If you think of your brain as a computer, it felt like I had a virus, and then my hard drive crashed. And all of a sudden — boom. They control all the leads, and they reboot you, and you’re OK again. I remember the doctor and the people in the OR literally laughing, like, ‘That’s a new one.’</p>



<p>“We laugh about it, but it came out of my heart,” he says. “It’s how I felt.”</p>



<p>These stories all sound remarkable, and in all sorts of ways, they truly are. The four people with depression I’ve told you about were pulled out of deep suffering and restored to themselves — for now, and for what Jon and the researchers expect will be a very long time.</p>



<p>But like any story, this one has its moments of despair.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the fourth part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p><em>[Content note: This story contains discussion of suicide.]</em></p>



<p>“The only thing I’ll slightly complain about — and it’s very vain — I only wish the batteries in your chest didn’t show up so much,” says Patient 001.</p>



<p>There is an intense physicality to deep brain stimulation for depression. Participants have two slight bumps on their head, wires under the skin of their neck and a battery-powered control unit implanted under the skin in their chest.</p>





<p>Because he was implanted with two sets of electrodes, Patient 001 has two battery packs, one on each side of his upper chest. He lives in a hot place near the ocean. “It just sucks I can’t take my shirt off at the beach and not be self-conscious about that.” Sometimes the devices in his chest feel alien to him when he’s going to sleep. “I put my hand on it to be comfortable,” he says.</p>



<p>Amanda has a strained relationship with the device, too. “I don’t like the idea of it. I don’t like how it feels. Every time I accidentally touch the wire in my neck, I’m like, ‘Ugh, ugh, I don’t like it,’” she says. “It’s getting better, but sometimes I can still feel that thing in my chest just sitting there.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">

<p>She also points out the annoyingly low-tech charging process, which is done with a wireless charger draped around her neck. Her charger shows only 10 percent increments, and the screen is on for only a minute before it locks up, without indicating that the charging is done. “They can get better at that part,” she says.</p>



<p>In addition to the charging, there are lots of tasks these volunteers complete as part of the research — surveys, mood ratings, video journals. Twice daily, Amanda clicks what looks like a TV remote at home to collect brain data. “I’m Bluetooth-enabled,” she says with a laugh. “I upload from the computer to the server at the hospital.” She and others also make regular trips to the lab at Mount Sinai.</p>



<p>These days, Jon takes the train from his house just outside Philadelphia to Mount Sinai so often that he knows exactly which crack in the sidewalk to stand by as he waits for his train at the New Jersey Transit station. On one of his visits to the lab, a mess of scalp electrodes were eavesdropping on his brain. The scientist doing the measurements, neuroscientist Allison Waters, mentioned that his electrode leads were zipping 130 pulses of electricity into his brain per second.</p>



<p>“She just said it off the cuff,” Jon says. Later, with his daughter, Jon did the math for a full day, doubling it for each side: “22 million, 500 thousand electrical pulses to my brain,” Jon says. “That’s what has kept me alive.”</p>



<p>During Jon’s surgery on August 22, 2022, doctors told him that his only job was to be present. After his incisions healed, he was given a new task: rehabbing his brain. Jon was initially dismissive of the new job. He already felt fantastic, cocky almost, and didn’t buy that he needed to work hard on rehab. “In the back of my head, I’m like, ‘OK, weirdos. I’m not sick. This is great. I’m good. I got this.’”</p>



<p>But about six weeks after his surgery, everything fell apart.</p>



<p>A malaise crept in, and Jon freaked out. “Oh my God, I feel it,” he said. “I feel it in my body.” He snapped right back into the habits that depression solidified: overeating, sleeping too much and hiding away from his family. “My wife, I’ll never forget it, was like, ‘Hey, we got an appointment at the school.’” But Jon told her he couldn’t make it; he was busy. It was a lie. “I didn’t have anything going on,” he says.</p>





<p>Jon knew that as part of the study protocol, around the sixth month, researchers would turn off his stimulation, a looming event that made him intensely anxious. His shift alarmed him so much that on the night of October 6, he sent an email to the Mount Sinai psychiatrist Martijn Figee to ask if his stimulation had been turned off earlier than planned. “Is there an earlier part of the program where it gets shut off too, such as now, and that is also part of the experiment?” Jon wrote. “Even if it was shut off, could you even tell me that?”<br><br>An hour and a half later, the email back was clear: “Your device is absolutely on<em>.”</em> His psychologist would address it with him at their next appointment.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Relearning to live with emotions</h4>



<p>As brain implants are used more and more, the risks of DBS have become somewhat clear. Regardless of why a person is getting it or where in the brain it targets,the technique can, like any medical procedure, go sideways. Electrode leads in the brain can break; the chest controller can fail; batteries can die. Infections, in both the head and chest, are a risk, as is wire tethering, a painful condition, also called bowstringing, in which scar tissue grows around the wire in the neck.</p>



<p>DBS can also carry risks that are distinct from other surgeries. Electrical stimulation in certain parts of the brain has been linked to unwanted behavioral changes. For people receiving stimulation for Parkinson’s disease, there have been cases of gambling problems and hypersexual behavior.</p>



<p>In one unusual case, a Dutch man treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder developed a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00152/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand-new and intense affinity for Johnny Cash hits</a>, especially “Ring of Fire,” “Folsom Prison Blues” and “Sunday Morning Coming Down.” When his stimulations diminish or his batteries die, the man subconsciously switches back to listening to his old favorites — Dutch-language songs and classics by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.</p>



<p>People being treated with DBS for depression have experienced relapses when the device accidentally stops working, for instance due to a battery failure or a wire breaking. But that’s not what happened to Jon.</p>



<p>Worries over spiraling dark moods surface among people with DBS for depression, says psychologist Shannon O’Neill, who works with Jon and other people treated with DBS at Mount Sinai. “We often talk significantly about the difference for them of how they can distinguish between depression and normal everyday sadness,” O’Neill says. This is the rehab part, she says. People who have lived with severe depression for years need to relearn how to recognize and tolerate garden-variety emotions, including sorrow.</p>



<p>As O’Neill describes ordinary sadness, it reminds me of the analogy that emotions are like the weather. We can spend the morning under heavy cloud cover, and then maybe we luck out with a full-blast sunny afternoon. But it’s fleeting. Likewise, our feelings are impermanent, O’Neill says. “Negative emotions come and go, just like positive emotions come and go. It can be passing and not ever-present.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emily Hollenbeck, whose DBS surgery was in 2021, says her recovery took time. “You’re letting your brain relearn how to live in the world without the constant threat of severe negativity, suicidality, all of that.” She had to learn how to cope with emotions, and trust that she’ll get through bad situations. “Basically, I’m relearning how to ride the bike, you know?”</p>



<p>Understanding that these feelings are transitory — that ups and downs happen — is something people with severe depression haven’t practiced, because they hadn’t had to. They’ve been perpetually stuck under heavy cloud cover. Emerging into an emotional landscape with those ups and downs can be intensely unsettling.</p>



<p>“At first it was scary,” says Amanda, who had DBS surgery last fall. “At first I felt like I was standing on the edge of a cliff.” An artist, Amanda draws her experiences to help her think them through. One of her pictures shows a cartoon Amanda wearing a rainbow shirt, standing high on a ledge of bright green grass with blue sky overhead. But she’s looking over the edge to the darkness below. “I had been pulled out of this giant pit, and I was worried that I would fall back in it again.”</p>

<p>But she hasn’t. When people recover from depression with DBS, they generally stay well, several studies suggest. Between three and six years after surgery, about 60 percent of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21285143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients had sustained improvements</a>, Mayberg and colleagues reported in 2011 in the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry.</em> In a longer-term study, most of a group of 28 people who had deep brain stimulation for major depression or a type of bipolar disorder <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.18121427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw benefits for more than eight years</a>, the researchers reported in 2019 in the same journal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Does DBS make people happy?</h4>



<p>The idea of a machine forcing happiness on us or taking away sorrow — that kind of mind control is unsettling for most of us. We are fiercely protective of the idea that our feelings originate inside of ourselves, that we are in charge here. So the idea that artificial happiness can be created by a computer that controls electrodes in our brain hooked to wires that snake down our neck? No thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That sentiment is understandable, but it’s not what people with these implants experience. As I’ve talked with people who had lived first with devastating depression and then with these devices, I have come to think that these implants do not make a person feel artificial joy. “DBS is not going to give you happiness,” O’Neill says. Instead, “it just kind of clears the way.”</p>



<p>Overcoming misconceptions about what this technology can and can’t do is yet another burden for Jon and others. The patients I spoke with were incredibly candid about their depression and their treatment. They graciously tolerated my questions. But being open about their medical condition and treatment can exact a steep price.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the fifth part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p>Like many people who have struggled with a mental illness, Emily Hollenbeck had plenty of stories of people not quite getting it. One memorable instance happened as she was about to be anesthetized for an electroconvulsive therapy treatment. The anesthesiologist found out that she had a Ph.D. in psychology. “His eyes settle on me, and he goes, ‘Oh, that’s ironic.’” Her academic background should have somehow prevented her illness, he seemed to imply.</p>





<p>A palpable silence filled the room. “I remember literally biting my tongue,” she says, “being like, ‘We’re not going to sass the guy who’s injecting the propofol.’”</p>



<p>Being open about depression can bring judgment, and danger: “If you are honest about what you need for your mental health, you can suffer consequences,” says Emily, who had DBS surgery in 2021. That can include lost jobs, lost relationships and perhaps most crucially, lost health care.</p>



<p>Those consequences are why I’m not identifying Patient 001 by his name. He works in an intensely intellectual and competitive field, and with a new baby at home, he can’t risk losing business over people’s mistaken assumptions.</p>



<p>There’s stigma surrounding depression, and there’s stigma surrounding its treatments. When Patient 001 told his family he was getting experimental brain surgery, they didn’t understand. “At first, they were like, ‘You’re crazy. It’s unsafe.’”</p>



<p>In a way, their reaction tracks with people&#8217;s suspicions toward other treatments for depression, and psychiatric disorders more generally, despite the fact that they work for many people. Since their rise to prominence in the 1990s, antidepressants have caught heat from people claiming the drugs change personalities and steal emotions. Electroconvulsive therapy is still crawling back after the damage done by portrayals like in the movie <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>. Even talk therapy can bring shame and secrecy.</p>



<p>So perhaps it’s not surprising that electrodes implanted into your brain raise a whole new set of assumptions, misgivings and judgments. People will live with these stigmas until society changes, until people start understanding what severe depression is like, and what treatments are like too.</p>



<p>“You’re screaming for help, and they just don’t understand,” Patient 001 tells me. “That’s probably one of the reasons I’m talking to you, even though I’m doing it anonymously. I hope one day one kid reads what you’re writing, and he finds DBS and he’s cured.”</p>



<p>Barbara, Jon’s wife, is no stranger to people’s uncomfortable reactions. “When we have told people that he has a pacemaker in his brain, basically, you get this sort of strange, ‘Oh my God,’…. They’re like, ‘What? You’re going to let them do this to you?’” There’s this assumption, she says, that the brain is somehow different from other parts of the body. The heart can also need a device that delivers electrical stimulation. So why not the brain? “It’s really interesting to see people, myself included, process that.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Watch a video of Barbara Nelson talking about her experience as a partner to someone with depression, and how DBS changed her family.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve been wondering the same thing: What sets the brain apart, and why are people so uncomfortable with attempts to change it?&nbsp;</p>





<p>Here’s what I think. Remember the Dutch guy who <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00152/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all of a sudden loved Johnny Cash</a> after his implant was turned on? That story sounds a bit trivial. His new musical taste didn’t bother him; it’s a minor thing in the grand scheme of things. But that change, that switch, arguably bores straight to the core of our unease. So many of us, myself included, consider our brains — and the minds they create — the bedrock of our identity. So when a disease attacks the brain, or a treatment changes the brain, we get nervous.</p>



<p>None of us like the thought of having a brain implant tell us what music we like, especially if we might not be aware of it. The stakes are much, much higher when it comes to how we feel.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Does DBS change who you are?</h4>



<p>Reporting this story, I heard a lot of jokes about being a cyborg, Bluetooth-enabled, bionic. People would laugh as they said it. But I wondered if there was anything more to these offhand comments. Does this brain implant change who you are?</p>



<p>Jon kindly tells me that he understands why I’d ask. “I can only tell you that it is the exact opposite of that question,” he says. For him, DBS took away his poison. “It purely eliminates the disease…. That’s it.”<br><br>Amanda echoes the sentiment: “Nothing I’ve ever done has changed who I am or my personality,” she says, DBS included. “I’m still the same person. I’m just suffering more or less.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emily flips my question on me in a beautifully philosophical twist: “What does that even mean? Where is the ‘me’?” Equating ourselves with our brains makes sense, she says, because much of what we experience comes through our brains. “But is that really where our selves are?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="478" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline.jpg" alt="portrait of Emily Hollenbeck" class="wp-image-3131432" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline-545x383.jpg 545w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline-640x450.jpg 640w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_5_inline-265x186.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131432">Emily Hollenbeck, like other people with DBS implants, had to relearn how to cope with her new emotional range.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131432">Courtesy of Emily Hollenbeck</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Who she is, Emily says, is an activity, a choice. Her depression took away those choices and altered who she was. But now, “I don’t have that feeling, so which of those is correct? I don’t know. But I know which one I like better. I know that’s not a satisfactory answer for your question, but what really gets to the heart of it is that I feel like I’m untethered, and I have the ability now to focus on the things that I do really care about. And that’s where my <em>self</em> lies.”</p>



<p>These days, Jon says, his sense of self is lighter. Without the poison coursing through his body, Jon feels better, more energized, more present in his life with wife, Barbara, their three kids, a dog, a cat and a bearded dragon named Lizzy. But, as his daily surveys make absolutely clear, he’s still crabby. “There are certain things that you realize are the disease, and certain things that are innate in who you are,” he says. His irritability scores didn’t budge after DBS. “I guess I’m just a cranky middle-aged dude now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Barbara may be one of the best judges of who Jon is now. Is he different somehow with DBS and without severe depression? “I don’t feel like he’s changed,” Barbara says. “I don’t feel like I have a different person living in my house. It’s not that creepy, sci-fi way, like there’s this new person,” she says. It’s just him, the Jon she met all those years ago.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Electricity Saved My Brain</h3>



<p><em>This is the final part in a series on deep brain stimulation for depression. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-depression-electrode-stimulation-surgery">Read from the beginning</a>.</em></p>
</div>



<p>Neurologist Helen Mayberg cringes at the slow pace of DBS research. Her <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(05)00156-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS089662730500156X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first paper describing DBS for depression</a> in the subcallosal cingulate (then called Brodmann Area 25) appeared in the journal <em>Neuron</em> in 2005. Almost 20 years later, she almost can’t believe that researchers are not further along in bringing this technique to people who would benefit from it.</p>





<p>“On the other hand, we’ve learned so much that maybe it’s not so bad,” Mayberg says. Still, she feels impatient. “We don’t have a lot of time,” she says. “People are dying now, so let’s fix them. And then we can make something better.”</p>



<p>Mayberg hopes to see the treatment become streamlined. The first heart pacemaker was an incredible piece of technology, but it was giant and clunky. Today, the powerful device, usually about the size of a matchbook, sits near millions of people’s hearts, keeping them beating. As with the heart, for the brain, “how do you go from complicated to simple? Everything is about the prototyping and the simplification,” she says.</p>



<p>What’s next? “What’s the future of this, the future three steps ahead?” Mayberg says. “I have no idea.”</p>



<p>Despite stories from Jon Nelson and others, deep brain stimulation still has its stigma to overcome, even in the research world. Questions of autonomy — of control over feelings and actions — crop up in ethics discussions of brain technology. But to Martijn Figee, the psychiatrist and DBS researcher who has worked with many people implanted with electrodes, those questions are a “luxury problem.” That framing ignores the idea that mental illness itself takes away a person’s control. “People who work in DBS are always a little frustrated by these discussions,” Figee says. “We’re always like, ‘Talk to the patients.’”</p>



<p>Figee, who receives consulting fees from Medtronic, a device company that makes brain implants, and his colleagues asked people before and after surgery for DBS for obsessive-compulsive disorder and Parkinson’s about their feelings of being in control of themselves. People did not report a loss of feeling in control of themselves after the procedure. In fact, the people treated for OCD reported a bigger jump in autonomy and control than the Parkinson’s patients. “That’s not something that bothered them at all,” Figee says, “because the OCD was more of a prison to them than the fact that they have this implant.”</p>



<p>Psychologist Shannon O’Neill, who treats people with DBS at Mount Sinai, says she hopes that the procedure will be more readily understood in the future: “What I’d love is a shift toward not making it a last resort,” she says. “I wonder if we wait too long to give an individual DBS.” She doesn’t mean that brain implants would be an early treatment, but instead, she wants other health care professionals to have more awareness of the procedure so that they can refer people who have run out of hope.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are the open questions?</h4>



<p>What’s next will almost certainly include nuanced and complex science. Big questions remain about where in the brain to stimulate, for which people and what kind of stimulation. Jon and Amanda are participating in follow-up studies searching for signs of recovery in their brains, bodies and microexpressions on their faces, and even in their voices. “The commitments are out of control,” Jon jokes. He spends eight minutes twice a day recording his brain waves, along with video journals and daily, weekly and monthly surveys. His brain is imaged regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers are searching for a hallmark, a signature, that can tell them the method is working. “I need to know when the depression is away, and I need to have a way to discriminate,” Mayberg says. “When are you having a bad day and when are you relapsing? Those are not the same thing.”</p>



<p>Mayberg and her colleagues just described one such hallmark in six people who underwent DBS for depression. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06541-3#Sec7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collection of changes</a>&nbsp;in brain behavior can indicate when a person has recovered, the researchers reported September 20 in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>A handful of trials are putting a spin on the typical DBS approach and studying what’s called adaptive DBS, which kicks in only when a certain pathological brain activity pattern is detected. That approach has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-severe-depression-activity-stimulation">worked well for a woman named Sarah with severe depression</a>. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published the details of her improvements</a> in 2021.</p>



<p>Similar on-demand efforts are happening for other disorders, including binge eating and post-traumatic stress disorder. Jay Gill, a brain researcher and medical student at UCLA told me that one man, a veteran with PTSD, described having an aura, a sort of premonition, just before his symptoms would get bad. With his adaptive DBS system in place, he still gets triggered and feels the aura, but instead of feeling worse, a feeling of calm sets in.</p>



<p>The optimal DBS approach for depression may be similar to the approach for PTSD, OCD, addiction and other psychiatric disorders. Or maybe not. There’s still so much to learn.</p>



<p>Not everyone thinks about depression, or any illness for that matter, as a battle. Jon does. And there were days — lots of days — when he thought he’d lose it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="419" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_6_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of Jon Nelson standing on an ice rink next to a red hockey goal." class="wp-image-3131450" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_6_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_6_inline-622x383.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092323_neurotech_6_inline-302x186.jpg 302w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3131450">Jon Nelson’s deep brain stimulation treatment hasn’t made him happy all the time, but he now enjoys experiences more, including moments like coaching hockey and softball.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131450">AIDAN KAHN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>These days, the Nelson house is bright. It’s full of laughter, riddles, good-natured teasing, homemade pizza — and an energetic kid on in-line skates who twirls and glides through the kitchen loop. It’s also full of hope for a future that’s better than the past. That makes me reluctant to ask Barbara a question that I know will be hard for her to answer: Is she worried that Jon’s DBS treatment will stop working?</p>



<p>“That’s always in the back of my mind a little bit,” she tells me. Over the years, Barbara has learned to temper her expectations for the future. “You just never really know what’s going to happen,” she says. In a way, she’s still guarded. “I don’t know if this is going to work forever,” she says.</p>



<p>“But my perspective is that even if something changes, we have had this time with him.… And if it keeps going forever, that’s amazing. It’s amazing. I hope it does.”</p>



<p>On the drives home from softball, field hockey, golf, basketball and ice hockey, Jon and whichever kids are around have chats. “I always call it ‘car talk with the kids.’” In one of these car talks, Jon’s youngest piped up. “He’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so happy you just kept fighting for us.’ These little comments that come out of nowhere. I’m like, ‘Oh my God. They get it. They understand it.’ It’s a trip.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-ai-drones-find-meteorites">How drones are helping scientists find meteorites</a></h4>

              
                <p>Meteorites offer tantalizing clues about what the early solar system was like. But finding them is far from rocket science. Often, researchers simply fan out across a landscape and walk for hours while staring at the ground. Now, some scientists are turning to drones and machine learning to help spot freshly fallen meteorites much more efficiently.</p>



<p>A team of six people on a meteorite-hunting expedition can search about 200,000 square meters per day, says Seamus Anderson, a planetary scientist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. But since the area over which a cluster of meteorites falls typically can’t be pinpointed to better than a few million square meters, searching can take a while, he says. “It’s quite slow.”</p>

<p>Around 2016, Anderson began toying with the concept of using drones to take pictures of the ground to look for meteorites. That idea blossomed into a Ph.D. project. In 2022, he and his colleagues <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac66d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported their first successful recovery of a meteorite</a> spotted with a drone. They’ve since found <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2023/pdf/6187.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four more meteorites at a different site</a>, the team reported August 17 in Los Angeles at a meeting of the Meteoritical Society.</p>



<p>Drone-based searches are much faster than the standard way of doing things, Anderson says. &#8220;You’re going from about 300 days of human effort down to about a dozen or so.&#8221; It’s also fun and exciting work, he says, but there are challenges too.</p>





<p>Anderson and his collaborators have used drones to search for meteorites in remote parts of Western Australia and South Australia. The team is tipped off about a fall site by networks of ground-based cameras that track meteoroids flashing through Earth’s atmosphere. Then, the hunt is on.</p>



<p>The researchers pack a four-wheel drive vehicle with drone and computer equipment, battery charging stations, generators, fuel, food, camping equipment, tables, chairs and more. The drive to the fall site can take more than a day, often on rough or nonexistent roads, Anderson says. “You hope you don’t pop a tire.”</p>



<p>After arriving, the team flies its primary drone at an altitude of about 20 meters. Its camera takes an image of the ground once every second, and the researchers download the data every 40 minutes or so when the drone lands to receive fresh batteries.</p>



<p>A typical day of flying can net over 10,000 images, which are then divided digitally into 100 million or so smaller sections. Those “tiles,” each 2 meters on a side, are fed into a machine learning algorithm that has been trained to recognize meteorites based on images of the real thing or terrestrial rocks spray-painted black. The latter are convincing stand-ins for real meteorites, Anderson says.</p>



<p>The algorithm is good but not perfect. It automatically discards most tiles — typically upwards of 99 percent — that don’t contain any meteorite-looking objects. But that still leaves roughly 50,000 or so tiles after a day’s worth of flights that must be manually checked by a human, Anderson says.</p>

Researchers are working on improving the algorithm further.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3131359">The Desert Fireball Network</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Most of the time, those tiles contain things that decidedly aren’t meteorites: animal poop, tin cans, snakes or sleeping kangaroos, for instance. Those objects get flagged as potential meteorites simply because the algorithm isn’t familiar with them, Anderson says, and it’s up to the team to winnow out those false positives.</p>



<p>For objects that still look convincing to the human eye, the researchers send out a smaller drone that flies much lower — about a meter off the ground — to investigate. Finally, the team goes out in person to examine promising candidates.</p>



<p>The researchers plan to train their algorithm to better avoid flagging things like poop and kangaroos as meteorites. And the team is working on making its computer code open-source so that other researchers can freely use it.</p>



<p>Anderson also hopes to see drones make an appearance in Antarctica, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/machine-learning-meteorite-antarctica">a hotbed of meteorite sleuthing</a> (<em>SN: 1/26/22</em>). But the icy environment will present a whole new slew of challenges, Anderson says, such as making sure sensitive electronic equipment fares well in the frigid conditions and overcoming the logistics of working in such a remote place. “Antarctica is a whole different beast.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/logs-evidence-oldest-wood-structure">Interlocking logs may be evidence of the oldest known wooden structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modified logs dating to about 476,000 years ago might be the oldest evidence of wooden structures, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Wooden artifacts decompose easily and are relatively scant in the archaeological record compared with stone or bone. The new finding, reported September 20 in <em>Nature,</em> suggests that the structural use of wood <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may stretch </a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> back</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> into the</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06557-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> history of human ancestors</a>, hinting at advanced cognitive skills and a less nomadic lifestyle for some hominids than previously thought.</p>





<p>“It&#8217;s a challenge to preconceptions about what are considered sophisticated, complex behaviors,” says Larry Barham, an archaeologist at the University of Liverpool in England. “For me, settling into one place and changing the landscape, that is very sophisticated.”</p>



<p>Humans and their ancestors have been using wood in some fashion for quite some time. The earliest known example of modified wood is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/004724849190015N" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a polished plank from Israel</a> dating to around 780,000 years ago. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/385807a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wooden tools</a> don&#8217;t appear in the historical record until about 400,000 years ago. Before this new study, the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/50/impact/star-carr-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earliest known example of a wooden structure</a> was much more recent: around 9000 B.C.</p>



<p>During a dig in 2019, Barham and colleagues found five modified wooden objects in the exposed bank of a river flowing into the top of Kalambo Falls in Zambia. The area is rich with forest and has a consistently high water table. This makes it ideal for human habitation — and the water also blocks oxygen from buried wood. Since the 1950s, archaeologists have excavated ancient technologies here, though wooden objects couldn’t be accurately placed in time and clear modifications had been worn away.</p>



<p>This time the team used a technique <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-first-settled-australia-early-65000-years-ago">known as luminescence dating</a> (<em>SN: 7/19/17</em>). Minerals buried underground gradually absorb background radiation like a battery taking up charge, which can be released later as light. This reveals how many years ago a sample last saw the sun. The team analyzed 16 sand samples‚ including from directly around the wooden objects, and grouped the artifacts into three chunks of time from 476,000 to 324,000 years ago.</p>



<p>In the sands that are nearly half a million years old, the team found two large interlocking logs, with shaped ends and wide, carved notches at the point they overlap. Like an early version of Lincoln Logs, this would have held the wood together. Both logs showed evidence of chopping and scraping, and were buried near tools used for scraping or carving, hand axes and other crafting equipment.</p>

<p>These logs may have been part of a structure — a raised walkway, a place to store wood or somewhere to sit — that helped early hominids in their environment, the researchers suggest. Based on timing and location, the structure could be the handiwork of <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>, a human ancestor that lived about 700,000 to 200,000 years ago. Other wooden objects recovered from the site include a wedge, a digging stick and a chopped log, dating from 390,000 to 324,000 years ago.</p>



<p>“This paper provides a wonderful peek into our past,” says Rebecca Biermann Gürbüz, a biological anthropologist at the University at Buffalo in New York who was not involved in the study. Other primates use wood and plants in a variety of ways, she says. “So the fact that [hominids] did so nearly half a million years ago is not surprising.”</p>



<p>In fact, Barham wonders if Stone Age is even the right term for that era. “Let&#8217;s say wood survived as much as bone does in the archaeological record,” he says. “Maybe we should relabel our Stone Age to the Woodworking Age, an Organic Age or something that reflects the reality of common behavior, which we can only really glimpse.”</p>

<p>Surveys show spreadsheets are the <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-692">most widely used</a> analytical tool in academic research. But they are <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0801/0801.3114.pdf">prone to errors</a>. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Public Health England lost <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988">16,000 test results</a> after using an old Excel file format to handle data. Whether this mix-up hampered local infection control is anybody’s guess, but it certainly could have. </p>



<p>The software is causing trouble for other lines of research, too, as our team and others have shown: Genomics studies that rely on Excel spreadsheets to manage data turn out to be riddled with erroneous gene names, or gene-name errors, and the issue is affecting more and more journals.</p>



<span id="more-127892"></span>



<p><strong>A persistent problem</strong></p>



<p>Gene-name errors were <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80">discovered</a> by Barry R. Zeeberg and his team at the National Institutes of Health in 2004. Their study first showed that when genomic data is handled in Excel, the program automatically corrects gene names to dates. What’s more, Riken clone identifiers – unique name tags given to pieces of DNA – can be misinterpreted as numbers with decimal points.</p>



<p>In 2016, we conducted a more extensive search, showing that in more than 3,500 articles published between 2005 and 2015, <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7">20% of Excel gene lists contained errors</a> in their supplementary files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are no documented cases in which gene-name errors have affected the conclusions of a study. But if a researcher unknowingly saved a spreadsheet containing such errors, someone importing those data for further analysis would face a reproducibility problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to these issues, the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0669-3">made changes</a> to some gene names prone to errors. This includes converting the SEPT-1 gene to SEPTIN1 and the MARCH1 gene to MARCHF1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The widespread adoption of these new names is a lengthy process: Our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008984">latest study, of</a> more than 11,000 articles published between 2014 and 2020, found that 31% of supplementary files that included gene lists in Excel contained errors. This percentage is higher than in <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7">our previous 2016 study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also found some novel errors. Some were connected to the local language setting. For example, the AGO2 gene was converted to Aug-02, perhaps due to “Ago” being short for “August” in Spanish. Similarly, MEI1 was switched to May-01 (“Mei” is “May” in Dutch), and TAMM41 to Jan-41 (“Tammikuu” is “January” in Finnish).<br><br>One of the significant findings in our study was the five-digit conversion. When saving a gene name converted to a date and importing it into a new Excel spreadsheet, the dates will change into a five-digit number. Software packages like HGNChelper and Gene Updater can help in fixing gene-name errors, but not once they have been converted to numbers.</p>

<p><strong>More and more journals affected</strong></p>



<p>Despite increased recognition of gene-name errors, scientific journals have taken no significant initiatives to mitigate the problem. Our continuous tracking of these errors, the data for which is publicly accessible at <a href="https://ziemann-lab.net/public/gene_name_errors/">https://ziemann-lab.net/public/gene_name_errors/</a>, reveals a steady rate of gene-name errors and a rising number of affected journals until recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This spread may be due to the expansion of omics into different branches of biology and medicine, coupled with the growth of second-tier journals.</p>



<p>But the problem isn’t limited to lesser-known journals. We found the journals with the highest numbers of affected articles were <em>Nature Communications, PLOS ONE, Scientific Reports, BMC Genomics, PLOS Genetics </em>and<em> Oncotarget</em>, with at least 100 affected publications each. Clearly, journals need to produce guidelines about how to filter for and address gene-name errors that can affect data reproducibility.</p>



<p>A substantial number of genes may be misnamed when the computer is set to a non-English language. Our studies only scratch the surface of this problem, but they plainly show Excel and other non-specialised spreadsheet programs are not designed to handle big data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although gene-name errors may seem like small fry in the grand scheme of scientific data analysis, they are a symptom of broader issues like over-reliance on spreadsheets and lack of consensus on how large genomic datasets should be reviewed and disseminated. These issues need to be addressed to improve the reliability of genomics research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sewage-key-track-disease-covid-19-wastewater">Why sewage may hold the key to tracking diseases far beyond COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">The future of disease tracking is going down the drain — literally. Flushed with success over detecting coronavirus in wastewater, and even specific variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, researchers are now eyeing our collective poop to monitor a wide variety of health threats.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, wastewater surveillance was a smaller field, primarily focused on testing for drugs or mapping microbial ecosystems. But these researchers were tracking specific health threats in specific places — opioids in parts of Arizona, polio in Israel — and hadn’t quite realized the potential for national or global public health.</p>





<p>Then COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>The pandemic triggered an “incredible acceleration” of wastewater science, says Adam Gushgari, an environmental engineer who before 2020 worked on testing wastewater for opioids. He now develops a range of wastewater surveillance projects for Eurofins Scientific, a global laboratory testing and research company headquartered in Luxembourg.</p>



<p>A subfield that was once a few handfuls of specialists has grown into more than enough scientists to pack a stadium, he says. And they come from a wide variety of fields — environmental science, analytical chemistry, microbiology, epidemiology and more — all collaborating to track the coronavirus, interpret the data and communicate results to the public. With other methods of monitoring COVID-19 on the decline, wastewater surveillance has become one of health experts’ primary sources for spotting new surges.</p>



<p>Hundreds of wastewater treatment plants across the United States are now part of COVID-19 testing programs, sending their data to the National Wastewater Surveillance System, or NWSS, a monitoring program launched in fall 2020 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hundreds more such testing programs have launched globally, as tracked by the <a href="https://ucmerced.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c778145ea5bb4daeb58d31afee389082" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVIDPoops19 dashboard</a> run by researchers at the University of California, Merced.</p>



<p>In the last year, wastewater scientists have started to consider what else could be tracked through this new infrastructure. They’re looking at seasonal diseases like the flu, recently emerging diseases like bird flu and mpox, formerly called monkeypox, as well as drug-resistant pathogens like the fungus <em>Candida auris</em>. The scientists are even considering how to identify entirely new threats.</p>



<p>Wastewater surveillance will have health impacts “far broader than COVID,” predicts Amy Kirby, a health scientist at the CDC who leads NWSS.</p>



<p>But there are challenges getting from promise to possible. So far, such sewage surveillance has been mostly a proof of concept, confirming data from other tracking systems. Experts are still determining how data from our poop can actually inform policy; that’s true even for COVID-19, now the poster child for this monitoring. And they face public officials wary of its value and questions over whether, now that COVID-19 health emergencies have ended, the pipeline of funding will be cut off.</p>



<p>This monitoring will hopefully become “one of the technologies that really evolves post-pandemic to be here to stay,” says Mariana Matus, cofounder of Biobot Analytics, a company based in Cambridge, Mass., that has tested sewage for the CDC and many other health agencies. But for that to happen, the technology needs continued buy-in from governments, research institutions and the public, Matus and other scientists say.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How wastewater testing works</h4>



<p>Wastewater-based epidemiology has a long history, tracing back at least to physician <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150208/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Snow’s 1850s observations</a> that cholera outbreaks in London were connected to contaminated water.</p>





<p>In the 1920s and ’30s, scientists began to take samples from sewage and study them in the lab, learning to isolate specific pathogens that cause disease. These early researchers focused on diseases that spread through contaminated water, such as polio and typhoid.</p>



<p>Today, automated machines typically retrieve sewage samples. The machines used to collect waste beneath maintenance hole covers are “like R2-D2 in terms of size” or smaller, says Erin Driver, an environmental engineer at Arizona State University in Tempe who works on collection methods.</p>



<p>Driver can plug this machine, or a larger version used for sampling at wastewater treatment plants, into a water pipe and program it to pull a small amount of sewage into an empty bottle at regular intervals, say, once an hour for 24 hours. She and colleagues are developing smaller versions of the automated sampler that could be better suited for more targeted sampling.</p>



<p>What happens in the lab to that bottle of waste depends on what scientists are testing for. To test for opioids and other chemicals, scientists might filter large particles out of the sample with a vacuum system, extract the specific chemicals that they want to test, then run the results through a spectrometer, an instrument that measures chemical concentrations by analyzing the light the chemicals give off.</p>



<p>To determine levels of SARS-CoV-2 or another virus, a scientist might separate liquid waste from solid waste with a centrifuge, isolate viral genetic material, and then test the results with a PCR machine, similar to testing someone’s nose swab. Or, if scientists want to know which SARS-CoV-2 variants are present, they can put the material through a machine that identifies a variety of genetic sequences.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Would the coronavirus even show up in waste?</h4>



<p>In the panicked early days of the pandemic, an urgent basic question loomed. “Will this even work?” remembers Marlene Wolfe, an environmental microbiologist at Emory University in Atlanta. While polio is spread through fecal matter, there were early hints that the coronavirus mostly spreads through the air; scientists initially weren’t even sure that it would show up in sewage.</p>



<p>On the same day in 2020 that the San Francisco Bay Area went on lockdown, Wolfe and colleagues at Stanford University, where she was based at the time, got a grant to find out. The team was soon spending hours driving around the Bay Area to collect sewage samples, “navigating lockdown rules” and negotiating special permissions to use lab space, she says.</p>



<p>“We were anxiously waiting to see if our first samples would show a positive result for SARS-CoV-2,” Wolfe says.</p>



<p>Not only did the sewage samples test positive, Wolfe and her colleagues found that coronavirus levels in the Bay Area’s <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.0c06191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wastewater followed the same trends as reported cases</a>, the team reported in December 2020 in <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>. When case counts went up, more virus appeared in the sewage, and vice versa. Early projects in other parts of the country showed similar results.</p>



<p>More than three years later, data on reported cases have become much less reliable. Fewer people are seeking out lab-based PCR tests in favor of easier-to-access at-home tests — with results often not reported. Wastewater trends have become the best proxy to provide early warnings of potential new COVID-19 surges, such as the increased spread this summer, to health officials and the public alike.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Opening the tracking floodgates</h4>



<p>In summer 2022, wastewater tracking got a new chance to prove itself. Mpox was rapidly spreading globally, including in the United States. But tests were limited, and the disease, which was spreading primarily through intimate contact between men, quickly drew social stigma, leading some people to hesitate in seeking medical care.</p>



<p>Within a few weeks of the start of the U.S. outbreak, Wolfe and her colleagues, as well as research teams at Biobot and other companies, had developed tests to identify mpox in sewage.</p>



<p>Just as scientists had seen with COVID-19, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2213882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mpox trends in wastewater matched trends in official case numbers</a>. In California, wastewater results even suggested that the disease may have spread farther than data from doctors’ offices suggested, Wolfe and collaborators reported in February in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em></p>



<p>Like COVID-19, mpox doesn’t transmit through the water, but sewage testing still picked up the virus. The early results from that summer outbreak convinced some health officials that wastewater technology could be used for many diseases, no matter how they spread, Matus says.</p>

<p>Scientists are starting to find more and more infectious diseases that can be tracked in sewage. “Honestly, everything that we’ve tried so far has worked,” says Wolfe, who is now a principal investigator of <a href="https://wastewaterscan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WastewaterSCAN</a>, a national sewage testing project led by researchers at Stanford and Emory. The project team currently tests samples for six different viruses and is working on other tests that it can send out to the more than 150 sites in its monitoring network.</p>



<p>Through an informal literature <a href="https://biobot.io/pathogen-biomarkers-in-wastewater-stool-and-urine-nearly-endless-opportunities-for-the-future-of-wbe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review of pathogens important for public health</a>, scientists at Biobot found that previous research had identified 76 out of 80 of them in wastewater, stool or urine, suggesting that those pathogens could be monitored through sewage. The list ranges from the chicken pox virus to the microbes that cause sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia to the tickborne bacteria that cause Lyme disease.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Finding focus</h4>



<p>With this much opportunity, the question on many researchers’ minds is not, “What <em>can</em> we test for?” but “What <em>should</em> we test for?”</p>



<p>In January, a report put out by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine came up with <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26767/wastewater-based-disease-surveillance-for-public-health-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three criteria</a>. The pathogen should threaten public health. It should be detectable in wastewater. And it should generate data that public health agencies can use to protect their communities.</p>



<p>Given all the threats and hints of what can be found in wastewater, the first two criteria don’t narrow the field too much. So for now, researchers are taking cues from state and local public health officials on which pathogens to prioritize.</p>



<p>Biobot is working on tests for common diseases like the flu, RSV, hepatitis C and gonorrhea. And the CDC has its eye on some of the same common pathogens, as well as strategies for tracking antimicrobial resistance, a threat that has increased during the pandemic as health systems have been under strain.</p>



<p>Even if they choose the perfect targets, though, researchers also have to figure out how to generate useful data. For now, that’s a sticking point.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to use the data</h4>



<p>Tracking pathogens is one thing. But determining how the results correspond to actual numbers of sick people is another, even in the case of COVID-19, where researchers now have years of detailed data. As a result, many public health officials aren’t yet ready to make policy decisions based on poop data.</p>



<p>In New York City over the last three years, for example, the local government has poured more than $1 million into <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/wastewater-can-predict-covid-19-surges-but-nycs-data-remains-hard-to-find" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing for COVID-19, mpox and polio in sewage</a> from the city’s water treatment plants. But the city’s health department hasn’t been using the resulting data to inform local COVID-19 safety measures, so it’s unclear what’s being done with the data.</p>

<p>Health officials are used to one swab per person, says Rachel Poretsky, a microbiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. She also heads wastewater monitoring for the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois.</p>



<p>Public health training relies on identifying individual sick people and tracing how they became ill. But in wastewater surveillance, one data point could represent thousands of sick people — and the data come from the environment, rather than from hospitals and health clinics. What to do next when positive results turn up isn’t as obvious.</p>



<p>Numbers collected from the health care system always represent patients, so a spike indicates a surge in cases. In the case of sewage data, however, environmental factors like weather, local industries and the coming and going of tourists also can create “weird outliers” that resist easy interpretation, Poretsky says. For instance, a massive rainstorm might dilute samples, or chemical runoff from a factory might interfere with a research team’s analytical methods.</p>



<p>Data interpretation only gets more complicated when scientists begin testing wastewater for an increasing number of health threats. Every pathogen’s data need to be interpreted differently.</p>



<p>With coronavirus data, for example, wastewater tests consistently come back positive, so interpreting the data is all about looking for trends: Are viral concentrations going up or down? How does the amount of virus present compare with the past? A spike in a particular location might signal a surge in the community that hasn’t yet been picked up by the health care system. The community might respond by boosting health resources, such as opening vaccine clinics, handing out free masks and at-home tests, or adding staff to local hospital emergency departments.</p>



<p>Mpox, on the other hand, has infected far fewer people, and positive tests have been rare after last summer’s outbreaks ended. Now, researchers are simply watching to see whether the virus is present or absent in a given sewershed.</p>



<p>“It’s more about having an early warning,” Matus says. If a sewershed suddenly tests positive for mpox after negative results for the last few months, health officials might alert local doctors and community organizations to look out for anyone with symptoms, aiming to identify any cases and prevent a potential outbreak.</p>



<p>Another complicated pathogen is <em>C. auris</em>, a fungus that has developed resistance to common drugs. It can spread rapidly in health care settings — and be detected in sewage. Researchers from Utah and Nevada reported in February in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases </em>that it was <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/2/22-1523_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible to track <em>C. auris</em> in the sewage</a> from areas experiencing outbreaks.</p>



<p>If hospitals or health officials could identify the presence of this fungus early, that information could guide public health actions to curb outbreaks, says Alessandro Rossi, a microbiologist at the Utah Public Health Laboratory in Salt Lake City. But interpreting the warnings isn’t as clear-cut for <em>C. auris</em> as for viruses.</p>



<p>The fungus can grow in sewage after it leaves health care facilities, Rossi says. The pathogen has “the potential to replicate, form biofilms and colonize a sewershed.” In other words, <em>C. auris</em> can create its own data interference, potentially making wastewater results seem worse than they really are.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Viral verification</h3>



<p>As mpox spread in the United States in 2022, scientists tested wastewater samples at nine sites in California for the virus. At five of those sites, the virus was detected before or within a day of the first case being confirmed in that sewershed.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Moving wastewater into the future</h4>



<p>Most current testing programs are reactive. By looking at health threats one at a time using specific PCR tests, the programs mostly confirm that pathogens we already are worrying about are getting people sick.</p>



<p>But some scientists, like Wim Meijer, envision a future in which wastewater monitoring wades into the unknown and alerts us to unusual disease outbreaks. The microbiologist, of the University College Dublin, heads Ireland’s wastewater surveillance program. Ideally, in this ahead-of-the-curve future, after detecting something alarming in sewage, his team could closely collaborate with health officials to study the pathogen and, if necessary, start combating the threat.</p>



<p>One idea for turning the tech proactive is to prepare for new health threats that we can see coming. For example, Meijer and his colleagues are interested in screening Ireland’s sewage for the H5N1 bird flu, but they are not yet doing this testing.</p>



<p>Another approach takes advantage of genetic testing technology to look at<em> everything </em>in our waste. Kartik Chandran, an environmental engineer at Columbia University who has mapped sewers’ microbial ecosystems with this technique, describes it as “trying to shine the light more broadly” rather than looking where the light is already shining brightest.</p>



<p>Such an approach might identify new pathogens before sick people start going to the doctor’s office, potentially leading to an earlier public health response. But with health officials still unsure of how best to use wastewater data, much more basic research is needed first.</p>

<p>“People think wastewater surveillance is the answer to everything, and clearly that’s not true,” says Kirby, of the CDC, reflecting concerns from the state and local officials that she collaborates with at NWSS. Before diving ahead into proactive surveillance, Kirby and her colleagues are working to set up basic wastewater standards and protocols for health agencies. Priorities include evaluating how sewage trends correlate to cases for different pathogens and developing standards for how to use the data.</p>



<p>The wastewater surveillance field also needs to keep growing if the goal is to monitor and contribute to global health, with more sites contributing data and more scientists to analyze it. All of this work requires sustained funding.</p>



<p>The CDC’s program so far has been funded by COVID-era legislation and will run out of money in 2025. While wastewater surveillance is more cost-effective than other types of testing, it still requires a lot of resources. Washington’s state health department, for example, paid Biobot more than $500,000 for a one-year sewage testing contract, while the CDC has paid the company more than $23 million since 2020 for its work with NWSS.</p>



<p>For the last few years, wastewater surveillance has been a giant, messy group project. Scientists have collaborated across fields and locations, across private and public institutions, through Zoom calls and through poop samples shipped on ice. They’ve shown that waste might hold the key to a new way of tracking our collective health.</p>



<p>A lot of unanswered questions remain, and it could be some time before your local sewer can tell you exactly what disease risks you might be facing. But COVID-19 pushed thousands of experts to look into their toilets and start asking those questions. “Now, everyone’s a believer,” says Driver, of ASU. “Everyone’s doing the work.”</p>

<p><strong>Searching for superheavies</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/chemistry-139"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 8, 1973</p>



<p>Physicists and chemists have been actively searching for superheavy elements, substances with atomic weights and numbers greater than the 105 [elements] now known. Results of two searches are reported … none were found…. Future searches will have to involve direct fusion of heavy nuclei by driving one against another in heavy-ion accelerators.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Particle accelerators have been crucial for creating superheavies beyond elements 104 and 105. Just a year later, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/element-106-takes-name-seaborgium">element 106, seaborgium</a>, emerged from collisions of oxygen ions and californium atoms — though its discovery wasn’t officially confirmed until two decades later (<em>SN: 3/19/94, p. 180</em>). Elements 107 through 118 have since made their debut, with several <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/four-elements-earn-permanent-seats-periodic-table">joining the periodic table</a> as recently as 2016. Scientists are now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-periodic-table-future-superheavy-elements">trying to create elements 119 and 120</a> (<em>SN: 3/2/19, p. 16</em>).

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-decode-rna-extinct-animal-tasmanian">For the first time, researchers decoded the RNA of an extinct animal</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, researchers have successfully extracted and decoded RNA from an extinct animal.</p>



<p>The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was a wolflike marsupial that went extinct after the last one died in a zoo in Hobart, Tasmania in 1936. Now <a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2023/07/18/gr.277663.123.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a roughly 130-year-old museum specimen has yielded bits of RNA</a>, the fragile molecules responsible for turning DNA’s genetic instructions into cellular functions, researchers report in the August <em>Genome Research</em>. The results shed new light on thylacine biology and may inform efforts to bring the marsupial back from extinction.</p>





<p>With dark stripes running over its tawny coat from its shoulders to its tail and jaws capable of opening more than 80 degrees, the thylacine (<em>Thylacinus cynocephalus</em>) was a striking animal. But the carnivores were no match for humans: As sheep farming proliferated in the 1800s in Tasmania — the home of the last remaining wild population of thylacine — the animals were frequently implicated in killing livestock. In the late 19th century, a bounty was established for every adult thylacine killed, and the animals were hunted nearly to extinction.</p>



<p>In recent years, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0417-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">researchers have mapped out the thylacine genetic blueprint,</a> in addition to the genomes of other extinct animals like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-dna-ever-recovered-mammoth-evolution">woolly mammoth</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). But such investigations were all focused on DNA. Only RNA can reveal how an organism’s cells actually functioned, says Emilio Mármol-Sánchez, a geneticist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “You see the real biology of the cell.”</p>



<p>In 2020, Mármol-Sánchez and colleagues came across a thylacine specimen in storage at the Natural History Museum in Stockholm. “It was just there in a cupboard,” says Mármol-Sánchez, then at Stockholm University and the Center for Paleogenetics in Stockholm.</p>



<p>The team collected six small samples of skin and muscle from the desiccated animal. Back in the laboratory, the researchers ground each sample into a powder and added chemicals that isolated nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA. Next, the team used a computer algorithm to compare those strings of nucleotides, or sequences, with a database containing the genomes of thousands of animals, plants, fungi, bacteria and viruses — including the thylacine.</p>



<p>The team concluded that roughly 70 percent of the RNA sequences they found were reliably thylacine, with some contamination from human RNA since the thylacine specimen was repeatedly handled.</p>



<p>Their analysis revealed different protein-coding RNA molecules in their skin and muscle samples. That makes sense, Mármol-Sánchez says. “Muscle cells and skin cells serve quite different functions in the body.” For instance, the researchers pinpointed RNA molecules that coded cells to make slow-twitch muscle fiber, which helps with endurance.</p>



<p>The team also found over 250 thylacine-specific short RNA molecules known as microRNAs. These RNA sequences regulate cell functioning, Mármol-Sánchez says. “They’re the policemen of the cell.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>These are impressive results, says Andrew Pask, a developmental biologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia who was not involved in the research. Many researchers never even look for RNA, he says. “It’s much less stable than DNA.” And the findings are doubly impressive given that the specimen was stored at room temperature, Pask says, rather than in sterile or frozen conditions. (RNA has been previously extracted from samples <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/34/4/793/2741258?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of existing species preserved in alcohol or ice</a>.) “It’s transformed the way that we look at museum and archive specimens.”</p>



<p>In the not-too-distant-future, Pask and other researchers are hoping to bring thylacine back to Tasmania. <a href="https://tigrrlab.science.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Their plan to de-extinct the animal</a> involves modifying the genes of one of the thylacine’s closest living relatives, another marsupial called a fat-tailed dunnart (<em>Sminthopsis crassicaudata</em>). These new findings could very well inform that effort, Pask says, by revealing genes that controlled the animal’s attributes. “It’s a whole other layer of information.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pink-diamonds-build-destroy-supercontinent">To form pink diamonds, build and destroy a supercontinent</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world’s largest source of natural diamonds — and of more than 90 percent of all natural pink diamonds found so far — may have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40904-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formed due to the breakup of Earth’s first supercontinent</a>, researchers report September 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>The diamond-bearing rocks of the Argyle mine in Western Australia probably formed about 1.3 billion years ago, the analysis shows, along a rift zone that sundered the supercontinent Nuna. The finding suggests that exploring ancient rift zones for diamond troves may be more worthwhile than previously thought.</p>





<p>On Earth’s surface, carbon atoms tend to form soft, dull graphite. But down in the forge that is the upper mantle, extreme conditions <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-rarest-diamonds-form-primordial-carbon-mantle">mold the element into hard, dense gemstones</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/20</em>). These diamonds can escape their chthonic womb by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbonation-brings-diamonds-surface">hitching a ride in rapidly ascending magmas</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/12</em>). Near the surface, the molten material solidifies as vertical tubes of volcanic rock, known as kimberlite pipes. Most diamonds are found in these formations.</p>



<p>But this classic story does not explain the Argyle formation, nor its pink diamonds. To make a diamond blush, something more powerful than mere mantle conditions must contort its sturdy crystal structure, altering how it absorbs and transmits light.</p>



<p>Another wrinkle lies in Argyle’s diamondiferous pipes. They are not kimberlite, but rather lamproite pipes, which are generally thought to form at shallower depths, says geologist Maya Kopylova of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Lamproites’ shallow origins may explain why they usually lack kimberlites’ rich diamond loads. The exception is Argyle — somehow, its lamproites raised treasures from the deep.</p>

<p>The oddities of the Argyle formation have long puzzled geologists. Chemical analyses conducted in the 1980s suggested it formed roughly 1.2 billion years ago. But that dating was questionable; the mineral that was analyzed may have been chemically altered by fluids in the Earth, potentially yielding a too-young age. What’s more, the results did little to clear up Argyle’s mysterious origins, says Hugo Olierook of Curtin University in Perth, Australia. “Nothing was really happening [geologically] in Australia at the time.”</p>



<p>So Olierook and colleagues dated resilient grains of the minerals apatite and zircon that fell into the lamproite when it was still molten. The researchers also analyzed titanite, a mineral that appears to have crystallized slightly later than the rest of the lamproite.</p>



<p>By measuring the quantities of radioactive elements and their decay products within each mineral, the team found that the lamproite formed about 1.3 billion years ago, roughly 100 million years earlier than previously suggested.</p>



<p>“When I first got the age, I thought, this doesn’t make any sense at all,” Olierook says. But while he was cycling home a couple of hours later, it clicked. “That’s when the first supercontinent was breaking up,” he says.</p>



<p>Argyle sits within an ancient continental suture, where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">two plates once collided to form part of Nuna</a>, roughly 1.8 billion years ago (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>). “It’s the smashing of those continents together; that’s what made those diamonds pink,” Olierook speculates.</p>





<p>About 500 million years later, when Nuna rifted apart, that suture split like a reopened wound. That may have opened conduits for lamproite magmas laden with rosy gems to rise through, Olierook says.</p>



<p>For decades, it has been thought that tectonic processes like rifting destroyed diamonds, Kopylova says. But this research supports a recent paradigm shift, she says. Rifting “might be a trigger to get diamonds from deep in the mantle to the surface.”</p>



<p>Nonetheless, she says, it remains a mystery why Argyle’s lamproite pipes are the only ones known that contained minable quantities of diamonds. In late 2020, the diamond mine there stopped production after exhausting the diamonds that were economically feasible to extract.</p>



<p>It may be the case that more gem-studded lamproites are awaiting discovery, Olierook says. Perhaps somewhere, another Argyle lies hidden in the ruins of an ancient rift.</p>

In contrast, the impact of conscientious objection on service users and their abortion journey is understudied, although this aspect appears essential to estimate the real-world consequences of abortion policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The authors of this study created a platform for women and those who can become pregnant to share experiences and opinions on conscientious objection. They interviewed service users and assessed how the conscience clause impacted their reproductive rights or influenced their access to and experience of abortion in the UK.<br />
All interviewees were able to access legal abortion without significant delays, mostly via their GP and not via self-referral. Although some doctors adhered to the relevant guidelines, not all were transparent in communicating conscientious objection, failed to provide comprehensive information, or treated service users judgmentally. Overall, service users felt scared, angry, and hopeless.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">These findings indicate that conscientious objection can work in practice even though more education and regulation that includes the missing voices in the conscientious objection debate are needed to improve doctors’ adherence to guidelines and ensure fair, impartial, non-judgemental care of all service users.</p>

<p>Low birth weight (LBW, &lt; 2500 g) infants are at higher risk for health complications and may require advanced neonatal care. Due to the limited provision of advanced neonatal care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), its strategic allocation becomes critical to improve health outcomes for LBW infants.</p>
<p>In these settings, predictive modeling can prove invaluable in identifying mothers at high risk of delivering LBW infants, enabling timely referrals to specialized care facilities.</p>
<p>This work tested five different predictive models to determine pregnancy characteristics associated with a greater probability of delivering LBW infants, using a large global registry, with enrolled pregnant women from several LMIC countries and research sites. Based on the obtained area under the curve (0.72), accuracy (61%), and recall (72%), the logistic regression model showed the best performance. All top-performing models identified clinical site, maternal weight, hypertensive disorders, severe antepartum hemorrhage, and antenatal care as critical factors for predicting LBW.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, predictive modeling proves effective in identifying high-risk pregnant women who may deliver LBW infants. This approach can be further developed into a clinical decision support tool to assist healthcare providers and enable timely referral of high-risk pregnant women before delivery.</p>
<p>Optimized referral and allocation could have substantial public health implications in LMICs by directing limited resources towards the most vulnerable infants, potentially reducing long-term morbidity and mortality rates in this population.</p>

<p>Breast cancer care inequities disproportionately affect minoritized groups of women in the US. Black women face 40 % higher breast cancer mortality rates than White women. Personalized risk assessment and tailored care are essential to reducing inequities in prevention and treatment, yet evidence suggests that Black and Hispanic women are less likely to access these services.<br />
This study focused on the Breast Cancer Personalized Risk Assessment, Education, and Prevention (B-PREP) program which helps individuals determine and understand their breast cancer risk, and informs on enhanced screening, risk-reducing therapies, and genetic testing.</p>
<p>In line with previous findings, this work revealed significant racial, ethnic, social, and linguistic inequities in access and referral to B-PREP. Black, Hispanic, non-English speaking, and publicly insured patients were less likely to be referred for breast cancer risk assessment than White or privately insured patients.<br />
The authors also conducted structured interviews with primary care clinicians to explore potential determinants of inequitable B-PREP referral patterns. Time and capacity limitations represented primary barriers leading to a lack of systematic approaches to address risk assessment and referral. Structural challenges, such as language barriers and socioeconomic factors, were also reported.</p>
<p>Altogether, this article exposes missed opportunities to provide preventive and screening services for breast cancer to historically marginalized groups that often experience delayed diagnoses and more adverse outcomes and calls for initiatives to improve primary care practitioners&#8217; education, facilitate personalized risk assessment, and ultimately promote health equity.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The evolutionary history of filter-feeding, a feeding strategy primarily known in whales, takes an intriguing turn with knowledge of the convergent evolution of </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus nanchangensis</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a one-meter-long marine reptile from the Early Triassic. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The feeding strategy of </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> remained long controversial, mostly because of the poorly preserved available skulls and the lack of gill slits of fish or the baleen of whales, the key structures that enable filter-feeding in fish and mammals.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zi-Chen Fang</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> et al.</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> aimed to resolve this controversy using two fossil specimens of </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hupehsuchus nanchangensis,</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with a well-preserved dorsal view of the skull.

<p style="text-align: left">Individuals with complex care needs often must navigate a web of services from various providers, including hospitals, primary care, home care, and municipal care, which can lead to treatment disruptions and harm their well-being.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The Swedish healthcare project, known as Esther, is a successful example of addressing these challenges. Named after Esther&#8217;s story, the project champions a person-centered, holistic approach that prioritizes individual preferences and needs, redefining the care experience. Initially designed for older adults, Esther now caters to individuals of all ages with complex care needs. It has yielded significant outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations, increased home care availability, enhanced patient satisfaction, and trust in regional healthcare.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">To disclose staff experiences and lessons learned, the authors of this study conducted a retrospective longitudinal case study with a qualitative mixed-methods approach based on document analyses, interviews, and focus groups with staff members and patients. Their findings underscore the critical roles of co-production and person-centeredness in improving care. Esther&#8217;s persistence over two decades is attributed to the promotion of systems thinking, embracing change psychology, and multidisciplinary improvement dialogues. Key focus areas include incentives, work in practice, and integration sustained by trust in frontline staff and continuous senior management support. A continuous learning approach further promotes integration into daily practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The central question “What is best for Esther?” unifies people, flattens the hierarchy, and reminds all care providers why they need to improve together. This paper presents valuable knowledge on how to move mindsets that connect and improve the care of persons with complex care needs, thereby informing and guiding practice in other health and welfare contexts.</p>

<p>It was that rarest of things: a sliver of good news about climate change.</p>



<p>According to calculations published last year in <em>Nature</em>, our planet was keeping pace, and then some, with rising emissions from tropical forest clearance by gobbling up more and more atmospheric carbon. </p>



<p>“What we can mainly prove is that the worst nightmare scenarios of an impaired carbon sink have not yet materialised and that the news is not quite as bad,” Guido van der Werf, a professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/global-carbon-emissions-from-deforestation-reveal-surprisingly-stable-co2-uptake-by-land-and-oceans.htm">in a press release</a> at the time.</p>



<p>His coauthor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-van-wees-91258a214/">Dave van Wees</a> added:</p>



<span id="more-127886"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It may well be that some of the climate feedback loops that we are concerned about, such as the thawing of permafrost or more forest fires, are already making their mark but are being offset by other mechanisms. </p>

<p>But on Monday, <em>Nature</em> retracted the article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04376-4">New land-use-change emissions indicate a declining CO2 airborne fraction</a>.” It has been cited 20 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, and was covered on at least <a href="https://climate-science.press/2022/04/02/climate-change-weekly-430-sec-abandons-mission-goes-woke-on-climate-change/">one climate-skeptic blog</a>.</p>



<p>Writing in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06605-4">retraction notice</a>, van der Werf and his colleagues acknowledged that their “statistical approach needs to be corrected and therefore accept a retraction as requested by the editor.&#8221;</p>



<p>We emailed van der Werf, van Wees and the paper’s first author, Margreet J. E. van Marle, for comments, but either did not hear back or received automatic replies stating they were unavailable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction follows an editor&#8217;s note from December stating <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04376-4#change-history">the results were in question</a>, and a short communication from April by researchers in Denmark and the Netherlands who took <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05871-6">a fresh look</a> at the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;A re-examination of the data using a variety of statistical tests finds no evidence of a trend on the whole sample and some evidence of a positive trend,&#8221; wrote <a href="https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/mikkel-bennedsen(9dc89b5b-f447-4ae2-b6ef-e1b9838c280d).html">Mikkel Bennedsen</a> of Aarhus University, in Denmark, and his colleagues. In other words, a stable or growing fraction of anthropogenic emissions would remain in the atmosphere.</p>



<p>Bennedsen declined to comment for this article. According to the retraction notice, his team assisted van der Werf and his coauthors in revising their calculations, which will be re-submitted for publication.</p>

                <p>As the world's population grows at an unprecedented rate, we must cope with a significant increase in people suffering with various neurological disorders. This brings with it a range of challenges: from personal well-being to social dynamics, healthcare, and economic systems. Among the issues that arise, there is a substantial increase in mental health disorders, which can significantly impact an individual’s quality of life.  One potential avenue for treating various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders is Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). This relatively non-invasive technology can boost and coordinate the rhythmic activity of brain circuits, potentially preserving or even enhancing cognitive and mobility performance. </p>

<p><strong>DBS: How does it work? </strong></p>
<p>DBS is a neurosurgical procedure that involves the placement of electrodes within specific brain regions. The electrodes are connected to a device called a pulse generator that sends electrical impulses to the brain. These impulses aim to modulate neural activity and restore more balanced brain function. </p>

<p><strong>Unveiling applications: How DBS can help patients</strong></p>
<p>DBS is used to treat various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depression. </p>

  <li><strong><em>Parkinson’s disease</em></strong><em>:</em> A study conducted by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University discovered that through the use of the well-established ‘bottom- up’ approach, (examining the fundamental components of a complex system and then building an understanding of the larger system based on this information), as opposed to the traditional ‘top-down’ approach, (beginning research with a broader      understanding before investigating specific components). This allowed them to define a more precise process of DBS for targeting Parkinson’s, which demonstrates greater symptom relief as well as long lasting effects. This breakthrough ultimately opens the potential for a breakthrough in Parkinson’s treatment. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Depression:</em></strong> DBS has been studied as a potential treatment for severe, treatment-resistant depression. In a study by researchers at the Ichan School of Medicine, DBS      was shown to have positive effects on participants that involved a gradual easing of depressive symptoms, as well as generally replacing negative outlooks with positivity. Their research ultimately concluded that DBS holds the potential to greatly impact the lives of people suffering from depression, however more research is needed to fully understand the safety, efficacy, and long-term effects. </li>
  <li><strong><em>OCD</em>:</strong> A study undertaken by researchers at the University of California demonstrated the potential modulation of OCD via DBS. They discovered that DBS holds promise as a potential treatment for OCD by modulating neural activity in particular brain regions, via disruption of the dysfunctional circuits responsible for obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. These effects accumulate over time, leading to improvements in OCD symptoms. The ongoing exploration of different implantation sites underscores the complexity of OCD and the potential for DBS to offer relief for      individuals who have not responded well to other interventions.</li>

<p><strong>Navigating challenges: What are the potential drawbacks? </strong> </p>
<p>While the potential of DBS is great, it comes with its fair share of challenges and considerations:</p><ol>
  <li><strong><em>Precision and targeting</em>:</strong> The precise placement of electrodes is crucial for  the success of DBS. Striking a delicate balance between accurate positioning and avoiding damage to surrounding brain tissue is a  considerable challenge.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Individual variability</em>:</strong> Responses to DBS can differ significantly from person to person, necessitating a tailored approach to optimise stimulation settings for each patient.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Long-term effects</em>:</strong> Ongoing research is delving into the long-term effects and safety of DBS. Questions about potential side effects and the impact of sustained electrical stimulation are still being explored. Additionally, there is no current evidence that DBS would work as a long-term treatment, as ongoing therapy may be invasive to everyday life. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Ethical and regulatory hurdles</em>:</strong> As DBS involves surgical procedures and device implantation, ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding patient consent, long-term monitoring, and potential risks are highlighted by researchers. Other ethical considerations include the resource intensity demanded from DBS procedure. In the current context of limited healthcare resources, the pros and cons of utilising substantial resources, such as the capital costs incurred and the need for a multidisciplinary team, must be considered.</li>

<p>Beyond DBS, several alternative treatments and interventions are transforming the field of brain health.</p><ol>
  <li><strong><em>Pharmacotherapy</em>:</strong> Medications continue to be a cornerstone of treatment for various      neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, for example the dopamine agonist ‘levodopa’ currently in use to help alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson’s. Ongoing research aims to develop more effective drugs and refine existing treatments. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Cognitive interventions</em>:</strong> Non-invasive techniques such as cognitive training and behavioural therapies focus on improving brain function through learning and adaptation, addressing cognitive deficits and mental health challenges. These methods are used to treat memory-related neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Neuromodulation techniques</em>:</strong> Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) are non-invasive approaches that have no surgical intervention. TMS has shown potential in alleviating symptoms of depression, as well as increasing general emotional wellbeing, whereas tDCS demonstrates improvement to cognitive functions such as memory and learning. </li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, DBS is a powerful instrument that can be used for both therapy and research of the pathophysiology of brain disorders. DBS has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, allowing for the process to become a familiar norm within the realm of neurological conditions. The field is still evolving every day, with many aspects of the process still to consider, however, the clear goal is to treat neurological disorders as safely and effectively as possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clara-sousa-silva-exoplanets-biosignatures">Clara Sousa-Silva seeks molecular signatures of life in alien atmospheres</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask Clara Sousa-Silva about her research and she’ll be absolutely clear: Yes, she is looking for aliens. But she is <em>not</em> hunting them.</p>



<p>“The idea that I&#8217;m hunting anything, I find very distasteful,” she says. “I have spent my life … trying to let go of the notion that I have to go somewhere to know it, that I have to touch it to know it&#8217;s real.”</p>

<p>Sousa-Silva is a quantum astrochemist at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., and an expert in knowing things from afar. Her research team studies how molecules in space interact with light, essential groundwork for scientists figuring out what the astronomical objects glimpsed through telescopes are made of. One day, she hopes her work will help identify traces of life in the atmospheres of worlds beyond Earth, including exoplanets — faraway worlds that humankind will almost certainly never visit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Molecules behave on a quantum level, and they interact with light on a quantum level,” Sousa-Silva says. “I’m using quantum behavior of molecules — so, chemistry — to study space.”</p>





<p>Though these quantum interactions play out on tiny scales, they leave traces in starlight’s spectrum — a chart of intensity at different wavelengths. Scientists can read spectra like a chemical bar code to identify the molecules the light encountered before reaching Earth. Each molecule contributes to the bar code, but scientists only know what those contributions look like for a handful of common molecules, says astronomer Adam Burgasser of the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Figuring out how a molecule interacts with light is a “very detailed computational problem,” he says. “It literally occupies a whole graduate thesis just to study one of these.”</p>



<p>One of those theses has Sousa-Silva’s name on it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A possible sign of life on Venus?</h4>



<p>During her Ph.D. at University College London, Sousa-Silva simulated the light spectrum of phosphine — a simple molecule that she says is still her absolute favorite.  Phosphine is considered a potential biosignature because it’s easily made by life but considered unlikely to form on a lifeless, Earthlike planet.</p>



<p>“I know no one else who is so knowledgeable about one molecule — any molecule,” Burgasser says.</p>

<p>With quantum chemistry and very powerful computers, Clara Sousa-Silva and colleagues have simulated the expected spectrum for the molecule phosphine at room temperature.</p>

<p>So when astronomers thought they might have detected the toxic gas in Venus’ atmosphere, they knew exactly who to call. A team including Sousa-Silva announced in 2020 that they’d detected phosphine in the atmosphere — which many, including Sousa-Silva, interpreted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life">as a possible sign of life on the planet</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/20</em>).</p>





<p>The detection itself and its interpretation as a sign of life <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-phosphine-possible-sign-life-doubts-how-science-works">have since been called into question</a> (<em>SN: 10/28/20</em>), including by Sousa-Silva herself. But the announcement got scientists thinking more seriously about phosphine. Researchers have continued to debate what detecting phosphine might mean, on Venus or an exoplanet, and to understand possible abiotic sources of the gas. As interest in the molecule grew, Sousa-Silva’s deep expertise drew her into the spotlight and “really put her on the map,” Burgasser adds.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to talk about biosignatures</h4>



<p>While Sousa-Silva still spends much of her time puzzling out the individual spectra of molecules scientists might spot in space, she has plenty else on her agenda.</p>



<p>She thinks a lot about how scientists can identify molecules more reliably. One of her students is currently working on a new way to quantify how astronomers can be certain that they’ve detected a gas — any gas — in a planetary atmosphere based on spectral data.</p>



<p>She also wants to find better ways to talk with the public about the uncertainties that come with biosignatures. “There&#8217;s an expectation that if we find aliens, we&#8217;ll know — we’ll be so sure. And that is so deeply unlikely,” Sousa-Silva says. “I think we&#8217;re so unprepared to communicate that.”<br><br>And mentorship has a big place in Sousa-Silva’s packed calendar. While at MIT, she ran the Science Research Mentoring Program at MIT and Harvard, which pairs high school students with astrophysicists to do research for a year. It’s not the first time she has worked with high schoolers; before heading to MIT, she founded the ORBYTS science outreach program (which also pairs scientists with high schoolers), and taught science in London high schools.</p>



<p>Within her own lab, Sousa-Silva focuses on preparing her students to step up, train each other and carry on the multigenerational project of filling in the “missing spectra.” In the long term, she sees her students leading more and more research.</p>



<p>However, she does admit that she wouldn’t mind continuing to lead some “less respectable” science projects. For instance, there’s some evidence that will-o’-the-wisps — bobbing ghost lights from folklore — might be phosphine-powered fireballs.</p>



<p>She spent much of her early career “just trying to be taken seriously — I wouldn&#8217;t even say the word <em>alien</em>,&#8221; she says. “As a woman in science … I felt like I really couldn&#8217;t afford to lose any respectability.”</p>



<p>Things have changed. Alien hunting is still off the table. But, she says, “I really would like to do some ghost-busting.”</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pak.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="292" height="242" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pak.jpeg?resize=292%2C242" alt="" class="wp-image-126500" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hui-Nam Pak</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A prominent physician-scientist in South Korea may soon be facing his fourth retraction. Last month, <a href="https://yonsei.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/huinam-pak">Hui-Nam Pak</a> of Yonsei University was found guilty of duplicate publication, a form of academic misconduct, according to a report from the school&#8217;s committee on research integrity Retraction Watch has obtained.</p>



<p>Pak, a cardiologist, has had <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Hui-Nam+Pak%22">dozens of papers flagged</a> on PubPeer. As we reported in February, journals pulled two of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/03/prominent-korean-heart-doctor-earns-two-retractions-in-a-month/">his papers</a> the previous month after a whistleblower pointed out problems with the articles. One was retracted for &#8220;a number of issues related to scientific misconduct,” while the other was a duplicate publication. A third paper by Pak was retracted years earlier after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/08/10/youve-been-duped-results-so-nice-the-journals-published-them-twice/">mistakenly being published twice</a> by the same journal.</p>



<p>Our February story triggered a flood of comments, many of them malicious. Some likened whistleblowing to &#8220;academic vandalism.&#8221; Others asserted that &#8220;whistleblowers deserve strong legal penalties&#8221; and that “immoral whistleblowers” seemed bent on ruining Pak&#8217;s &#8220;outstanding career.&#8221; Many comments were rejected for not adhering to our commenting policies, in particular making unsubstantiated claims.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/%EB%B3%B8%EC%A1%B0%EC%82%AC-%EA%B2%B0%EA%B3%BC%ED%86%B5%EB%B3%B4%EC%A0%9C%EB%B3%B4%EC%9E%90.pdf">September 12 report from Yonsei University</a> (in Korean) explains that an &#8220;informant&#8221; reported two of Pak&#8217;s papers to the school&#8217;s Research Ethics Integrity Committee on March 7. </p>



<span id="more-127883"></span>



<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com/article/S0167-5273(11)00477-3/fulltext#articleInformation">Impaired mobilization of bone marrow derived CD34 positive mononuclear cells is related to the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after radiofrequency catheter ablation</a>&#8221; was published online in 2011 in the <em>International Journal of Cardiology</em>. According to a machine translation of Yonsei&#8217;s report, the article overlaps significantly with the paper &#8220;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/europace/article/11/8/1024/425545">Non-ischaemic titrated cardiac injury caused by radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation mobilizes CD34-positive mononuclear cells by non-stromal cell-derived factor-1α mechanism</a>,&#8221; published in 2009 in <em>EP Europace</em>.</p>



<p>The latter paper &#8220;is listed in the references of paper No. 1,&#8221; the report states, &#8220;but the research subjects of the two papers are the same, and the research results of the comparative paper are part of the research results of paper No. 1 … so it is a substantially similar work. Nevertheless, the [second paper] was recognized as a separate research achievement … so it was an unfair duplicate publication.&#8221;</p>



<p>We emailed the editor-in-chief of the <em>International Journal of Cardiology</em> and Elsevier, its publisher, but did not immediately hear back.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The second paper reported to Yonsei University, “<a href="https://eymj.org/search.php?where=aview&amp;id=406858&amp;code=0069YMJ&amp;vmode=FULL">eNOS3 Genetic Polymorphism Is Related to Post-Ablation Early Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation</a>,” was the one retracted in January due to scientific misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The informant claimed <a href="https://www.ellinorlab.org/team/patrick-t-ellinor-md-phd/">Patrick T. Ellinor</a>, a professor at Harvard Medical School, had been listed as a coauthor of that paper &#8220;even though he did not contribute to the research.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the committee found: &#8220;According to the explanation of the person under investigation, Professor Patrick T. Ellinor contributed to the research by presenting the research methodology and conducting a review of the research results, so it is difficult to say that the person under investigation committed research misconduct equivalent to unfair author indication.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neither Pak nor Ellinor responded to requests for comments.</p>



<p>The informant also alleged Pak might have doctored the data in the article. But those concerns &#8220;appear to be about simple errors in the research and scientific validity rather than issues of ethics, so it is difficult to say that the person under investigation committed research misconduct equivalent to forgery and falsification,&#8221; the report states.</p>

                <p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe it&rsquo;s been only three years since we launched our first partnership models at PLOS. After adding five new journals to our portfolio in 2021, and introducing our Global Equity model to support regional equitable Open Access publishing, we saw explosive growth in our partnerships program and we&rsquo;re very excited to report that we&rsquo;re still growing!</p>



<p>Since our last <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">progress update</a>, we&rsquo;ve welcomed 107 new institutions to our program&ndash;including our first partners in <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/05/plos-expands-footprint-in-europe-with-a-publishing-agreement-in-italy/">Italy </a>and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/11/plos-announces-publishing-agreement-with-the-largest-research-institution-in-mexico/">Mexico</a>. As of today, we have nearly 300 partners across 28 countries, working alongside PLOS to reduce the burden of APCs on authors and eliminate barriers to Open Access publishing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="417" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21590" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2.png 800w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2-300x156.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/PLOS-partnership-growth-800xwide-2-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>



<p> Authors based in Research4Life countries also automatically publish in our journals at <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance">reduced or no cost</a>.  </p>



<p><strong>Why are PLOS models different?</strong></p>



<p>PLOS has always been a nonprofit, fully Open Access publisher working to ensure anyone can access, learn from, share and reuse rigorous, high-quality research. While our articles have always been open to everyone to read, lack of consistent funding for APCs has created a barrier for many researchers. In the wider industry, the dominance of pay-per-article models has increased pressure on academic volume output to generate profits, and created opportunities for exploitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to do things better.</p>



<p>Our models are designed to address critical challenges to inclusion in Open Access publishing that are a byproduct of the APC system: equitably distributing the cost of selective publishing, providing regionally equitable ways to ensure our inclusive journals represent researchers from all backgrounds; and streamlining the support system for libraries to reduce administrative burdens. All PLOS journals offer APC-alternatives through these partnerships, including our new launches <a href="https://plos.org/complex-systems-research-journal/?utm_id=408&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=407csy0623&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwjaWoBhAmEiwAXz8DBbnUOXtGnjGfcKJ5B8PjSFT__b_kpcYIn0mr3wcXOMLaEyJbNSf1ixoC0Y0QAvD_BwE"><em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> </a>and <em><a href="https://plos.org/mental-health-research-journal/">PLOS Mental Health</a></em> which will be supported by our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee Agreements</a> respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re excited by the enthusiasm we&rsquo;ve seen from the scholarly community for these models, and to have the opportunity to welcome so many new partners. Each new partnership is a step towards making Open Access publishing more equitable and inclusive. As we expand our portfolio this year, and continue to innovate on our models and services for both authors and their institutions, we hope to see this trend continue until cost is no longer a barrier for any author who wants to make their work open.<br></p>



<p><strong>Together, we&rsquo;re building the future of Open Access publishing</strong></p>



<p>Our work wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without the support of the librarians who work with us now, and who we hope to work with in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To truly change the scholarly landscape, we need to work together on solutions that are sustainable for all stakeholders. Since we developed our first APC-alternative models in 2020, we&rsquo;ve been working with institutions to improve our services, understand and support their needs so that the cost of Open Access publishing is managed more equitably and sustainably through effective partnership. Together we can rewrite the system.</p>



<p>Your feedback and support is what makes this growth possible. We want to thank all of our partners for their commitment to Open Access and support of their researchers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/catalog-human-cells-math-pattern">A catalog of all human cells reveals a mathematical pattern</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human body is made up of a complex community of trillions of cells of diverse shapes and sizes, all working together to keep you alive. The smallest of these cells, like platelets and red blood cells, are dwarfed by massive muscle cells. When it comes to size, it’s like comparing a shrew to a blue whale.</p>



<p>Now, after collecting data on all of the major types of cells in the body, researchers have revealed a familiar mathematical pattern in these cells’ relationship. There is an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303077120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inverse relationship between cell size and number</a>, meaning smaller cells are more numerous than larger cells. What’s more, cells of different size classes all have a similar total mass, such that small, numerous cells such as red blood cells contribute the same amount to the body’s total mass as the largest cells, the researchers report September 18 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>“We see this pattern all over the place,” across disparate fields, says Ian Hatton, an ecologist at McGill University in Montreal.</p>



<p>The pattern between size and number “has lots of different names,” he says. In ecology, it’s often called the Sheldon spectrum after marine ecologist Raymond Sheldon. Sheldon and his colleagues discovered that when you <a href="https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.4319/lo.1972.17.3.0327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort plankton by size</a> in orders of magnitude on a logarithmic scale, each size class has the same mass of organisms. As you go up in size, the number of individuals in a class drops, but the overall mass is unchanged.</p>



<p>In 2021, Hatton and colleagues showed that the same pattern exists when you sort <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abh3732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the biomass of ocean organisms generally</a> on a logarithmic scale, “from bacteria to whales,” not just plankton.</p>



<p>A parallel trend may also be seen in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-014-0585-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequency of words used in language</a>, where it’s known as Zipf’s law after linguist George Zipf. &nbsp;For example, if you analyze the words used in a book, you’ll find it dominated by a few, short, high-frequency words (like “the” and “of”) with many longer, low-frequency words (like “trombone” and “parliament”) making up the rest.</p>



<p>Finding this pattern in human cells took a <a href="https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colossal amount of data.</a></p>



<p>&#8220;It might sound surprising that we still don&#8217;t understand cell size well,” says Evgeny Zatulovskiy, a biologist at Stanford University, who was not involved with the study. The new study “provides a very comprehensive catalog of different cell types in our body regarding their counts and their size.”</p>



<p>Independent researcher Jeffery Shander first started assembling this data more than a decade ago. Much of it comes from the International Commission on Radiological Protection, which has autopsied countless cadavers and weighed their organs to build a reference model of a person.</p>



<p>But “the ICRP focused on the male model,” Hatton says. He and his colleagues wanted to estimate information for a typical human female and child as well. That, along with the fact that the ICRP was focused on organs and tissues rather than cells, meant turning to the scientific literature.</p>



<p>In total, the researchers gathered data from more than 1,500 sources to show that the inverse size-number pattern is present in the cells of a typical man, woman and child. Overall, the researchers estimate that an adult male is made up of around 36 trillion cells, on average, while a female is composed of 28 trillion cells, and a 10-year-old child has 17 trillion cells.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bodys-bacteria-dont-outnumber-human-cells-so-much-after-all">estimates are similar to ones from prior studies</a>, including ones that looked at fewer cell and tissue types, because of the overwhelming presence of small blood cells (<em>SN: 1/8/16</em>).</p>





<p>It’s important to understand how many of each type of cell there is. For instance, the team found that the total number of lymphocytes in the body had been severely underestimated — instead of 500 billion, there may be as many as 2 trillion. “Lymphocytes are implicated in all sorts of defense against disease,” Hatton says, and understanding their total number is important for individuals with conditions like leukemia and HIV.  </p>



<p>What’s more, cell number is determined by cell division, a process that, when it goes haywire, leads to cancer. Understanding basic features of cells like size and number, Hatton says, “could help us understand abnormalities.”</p>



<p>Even though it’s been seen in language, ocean biomass and now human cells, the origins of the inverse size-number pattern are still a puzzle. But Hatton says its commonality “might be implying that there&#8217;s some deep, underlying mechanism that could be common to all these different things. But we&#8217;re not there yet.”</p>
