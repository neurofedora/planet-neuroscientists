<p>A government expert committee in Pakistan last year cleared a university vice-chancellor of plagiarism charges based on inconsistent claims of ignorance, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The committee, which was convened by the Higher Education Commission (HEC), also appears to have flouted rules that would have held the vice-chancellor responsible even if he had no knowledge of any plagiarism committed by work under his supervision. HEC funds and oversees higher education in Pakistan.</p>



<p>&#8220;This sends the wrong message to the academic community and undermines the credibility of the HEC,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/farukh-iqbal-0bb3663a/?originalSubdomain=au">Farukh Iqbal</a>, who brought the charges, told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The case seemed simple enough at first. But it has since spiraled into a saga that may reveal as much about the value of political muscle in Pakistan as it does about academic dishonesty.</p>



<span id="more-126697"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In October 2020, Iqbal was working toward a PhD in chemical engineering at RMIT University in Australia when <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/27/vice-chancellor-of-university-in-pakistan-loses-paper-for-plagiarizing-from-a-thesis/">he noticed</a> a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001623612032202X">paper</a> in the journal <em>Fuel</em> that looked <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jctb.6408">familiar</a>. The authors, it turned out, had lifted heavily from Iqbal&#8217;s 2017 <a href="http://utpedia.utp.edu.my/id/eprint/21973/">master&#8217;s thesis</a>, as we reported in 2021.</p>



<p>Iqbal complained to both the HEC and <em>Fuel</em>. The journal investigated and found that Iqbal’s work had indeed been plagiarized. It <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236122006457">pulled the paper</a> in June 2021. (The retraction notice mistakenly refers to a PhD thesis.)</p>



<p>That same month, however, the first author of the retracted paper, Vice-chancellor <a href="https://kfueit.edu.pk/vision-of-new-vice-chancellor">Muhammad Suleman Tahir</a> of Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology, in Rahim Yar Khan, returned fire. In a long-winded email to RMIT, he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original-Complaint-email-from-Professor-Tahir-.pdf">accused Iqbal</a> of plagiarizing from a 2019 <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ZahidMasood17/final-ms-presentationpptx">master&#8217;s thesis</a> by a student that Tahir had supervised. He also expressed frustration at <em>Fuel</em>&#8216;s &#8220;one-sided decision&#8221; to retract &#8220;our paper.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tahir and his coauthors also brought a 500 million rupee (~$2,800,000USD) <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/court-filings.pdf">defamation suit</a> against his accuser. As we reported last year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/02/vice-chancellor-in-pakistan-sues-researcher-whose-work-he-plagiarized-and-says-he-was-the-victim/">they argued</a> that Iqbal&#8217;s “ugly campaign” had “irreparably injured … [the] credit, character, reputation and health” of the plaintiffs, who have suffered “indescribable isolation, persecution, mental torture, humiliation and material loss” in the process.</p>



<p>After looking into Tahir&#8217;s allegations, RMIT <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RMIT-letter.pdf">concluded</a> that it was indeed Iqbal, and not the vice-chancellor, who was the victim of plagiarism. </p>



<p>In Pakistan, however, HEC officials viewed matters differently.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Response-to-Iqbals-complaint-on-Citizen-Portal.pdf">response</a> from early 2021 to Iqbal&#8217;s complaint stated, &#8220;Dear citizen, text of your repeated complaint lacks quantitative facts, rather it reflects your personal grievance with the accused. The mentioned paper have [sic] been looked into with closed look by the plagiarism standing committee and your claim is not found true, anywhere!&#8221;</p>



<p>Iqbal complained several more times, as he explained in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/My-reply-to-Hec-investigation-with-all-documents.pdf">submission to the HEC</a>. In the end, the HEC convened an expert committee to review the case, and in February 2022 the committee issued <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Vice-Chancellor-KFUEIT-Rahim-Yar-Khan.pdf">its report</a>. In a written statement to the committee, the report said, the vice-chancellor had explained that &#8220;he was not aware of the [now-retracted] publication and his name was added without his consent.&#8221; </p>



<p>In fact, Tahir was the one who approached <em>Fuel</em> and asked for the retraction, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The committee found nothing contrary to what [Tahir] has presented in his letter / written statement. Therefore, he was not found responsible for the publication of the alleged plagiarized paper,&#8221; the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It added, however, that the source of the data in the <em>Fuel</em> paper was the thesis submitted by Tahir&#8217;s student Numair Manzoor, and that Manzoor&#8217;s thesis was &#8220;completely plagiarized as claimed by Mr. Farukh Iqbal.&#8221; But that was of no import for the complaint against the vice-chancellor, the committee found, and it recommended &#8220;no penalty against him.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In his complaint, Iqbal also cited regulations that <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HEC-upholds-decision.pdf">had been reaffirmed</a> by the HEC in 2017. According to this statute, if a master&#8217;s thesis was found to be plagiarized, the supervisor would &#8220;also be held responsible for this act and will be blacklisted for five (05) years,” and &#8220;disciplinary action against such supervisor should also be initiated by the respective university.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iqbal knew that even a cursory look at the evidence showed that Tahir had been well aware of the <em>Fuel</em> paper and had in fact opposed its retraction, as Tahir himself had explained in his email to RMIT. Tahir had also acknowledged his authorship in the defamation suit against Iqbal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iqbal also bristled at the claim that the vice-chancellor had been the one to request the retraction of the <em>Fuel</em> paper. Not only did it contradict Tahir’s email to RMIT, Iqbal also had an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Elsevier-email.pdf">email from Elsevier</a>, the journal&#8217;s publisher, in which it shared with him the &#8220;great news&#8221; of the retraction and thanked him for his patience with the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tahir has not faced any sanctions, as far as Retraction Watch is aware. Neither he nor the HEC responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>Iqbal, who says the experience contributed to his decision to leave his PhD studies, filed <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Appeal.pdf">an appeal</a> to the HEC in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Gmail-Review-Appeal-Against-the-Decision-of-HEC-Experts-Committee-bearing-No.-Ref_-3-1-268-P_QAD_HEC_2022_216-dated-February-28-2022-under-Section-13-of-HEC-Plagiarism-Policy.pdf">March 2022</a>. He was told the expert committee would make a decision <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HEC-letter-dated-20.04.2022.pdf">within 60 days</a>. </p>



<p>Almost a year later, he has still not heard back.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/race-label-genetic-stigma-diversity">Why experts recommend ditching racial labels in genetic studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>Race should no longer be used to describe populations in most genetics studies, a panel of experts says.</p>



<p>Using race and ethnicity to describe study participants gives the mistaken impression that humans can be divided into distinct groups. Such labels have been used to stigmatize groups of people, but <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26902/using-population-descriptors-in-genetics-and-genomics-research-a-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not explain biological and genetic diversity</a>, the panel convened by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said in a report on March 14.</p>





<p>In particular, the term Caucasian should no longer be used, the committee recommends. The term, coined in the 18th century by German scientist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach to describe what he determined was the most beautiful skull in his collection, carries the false notion of white superiority, the panel says.</p>



<p>Worse, the moniker “has also acquired today the connotation of being an objective scientific term, and that’s what really led the committee to take objection with it,” says Ann Morning, a sociologist at New York University and a member of the committee that wrote the report. “It tends to reinforce this erroneous belief that racial categories are somehow objective and natural characterizations of human biological difference. We felt that it was a term that … should go into the dustbin of history.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the term “black race” shouldn’t be used because it implies that Black people are a distinct group, or race, that can be objectively defined, the panel says.</p>



<p>Racial definitions are problematic “because not only are they stigmatizing, they are historically wrong,” says Ambroise Wonkam, a medical geneticist at Johns Hopkins University and president of the African Society of Human Genetics. Race is often used as a proxy for genetic diversity. But “race cannot be used to capture diversity at all. Race doesn&#8217;t exist. There is only one race, the human race,” says Wonkam, who was not involved with the National Academies’ panel.</p>



<p>Race might be used in some studies to determine how genetic and social factors <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racial-bias-race-us-patient-medical-notes-chart-records">contribute to health disparities</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/22</em>), but beyond that race has no real value in genetic research, Wonkam adds.</p>



<p>Researchers could use other identifiers, including geographical ancestry, to define groups of people in the study, Wonkam says. But those definitions need to be precise.</p>



<p>For instance, some researchers group Africans by language groups. But a Bantu-speaking person from Tanzania or Nigeria where malaria is endemic would have a much higher genetic risk of sickle cell disease than a Bantu-speaking person whose ancestors are from South Africa, where malaria has not existed for at least 1,000 years. (Changes in genes that make hemoglobin can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sickle-cell-may-blunt-not-stop-malaria">protect against malaria</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/11</em>), but cause life-threatening sickle cell disease.)</p>





<p>Genetic studies also have to account for movements of people and mixture between multiple groups, Wonkam says. And labeling must be consistent for all groups in the study, he says. Current studies sometimes compare continent-wide racial groups, such as Asian, with national groups, such as French or Finnish, and ethnic groups, such as Hispanic.</p>



<h4>An argument for keeping race in rare cases</h4>



<p>Removing race as a descriptor may be helpful for some groups, such as people of African descent, says Joseph Yracheta, a health disparities researcher and the executive director of the Native BioData Consortium, headquartered on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation in South Dakota. “I understand why they want to get rid of race science for themselves, because in their case it’s been used to deny them services,” he says.</p>



<p>But Native Americans’ story is different, says Yracheta, who was not part of the panel. Native Americans’ unique evolutionary history have made them a valuable resource for genetics research. A small starting population and many thousands of years of isolation from humans outside the Americas have given Native Americans and Indigenous people in Polynesia and Australia some genetic features that may make it easier for researchers to find variants that contribute to health or disease, he says. “We’re the Rosetta stone for the rest of the planet.”</p>



<p>Native Americans “need to be protected, because not only are our numbers small, but we keep having things taken away from us since 1492. We don’t want this to be another casualty of colonialism.” Removing the label of Indigenous or Native American may erode tribal sovereignty and control over genetic data, he says.</p>



<p>The panel does recommend that genetic researchers should clearly state why they used a particular descriptor and should involve study populations in making decisions about which labels to use.</p>



<p>That community input is essential, Yracheta says. The recommendations have no legal or regulatory weight. So he worries that this lack of teeth may allow researchers to ignore the wishes of study participants without fear of penalty.</p>



<h4>Still seeking diversity in research participants</h4>



<p>Genetics research has suffered from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white">lack of diversity</a> of participants (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>). To counteract the disparities, U.S. government regulations require researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health to collect data on the race and ethnicity of study participants. But because those racial categories are too broad and don’t consider the social and environmental conditions that may affect health, the labels are not helpful in most genetic analyses, the panel concluded.</p>



<p>Removing racial labels won’t hamper diversity efforts, as researchers will still seek out people from different backgrounds to participate in studies, says Brendan Lee, who is president of the American Society of Human Genetics. But taking race out of the equation should encourage researchers to think more carefully about the type of data they are collecting and how it might be used to support or refute racism, says Lee, a medical geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who was not part of the panel.</p>



<p>The report offers decision-making tools for determining what descriptors are appropriate for particular types of studies. But “while it is a framework, it is not a recipe where in every study we do A, B and C,” Lee says.</p>



<p>Researchers probably won’t instantly adopt the new practices, Lee says. “It is a process that will take time. I don’t think it is something we can expect in one week or one evening that we’ll all change over to this, but it is a very important first step.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rover-bread-crumbs-hansel-gretel-technology">A trick inspired by Hansel and Gretel could help rovers explore other worlds</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the classic fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel dropped bread crumbs while walking through a treacherous forest so they wouldn’t lose their way. Rovers may one day use a similar trick to traverse other planets without losing their data.</p>



<p>Typically, if a rover permanently loses communication during a mission, all the information that it has gathered is lost. To avoid this, researchers suggest using a multi-rover system in which a smaller rover piggybacks on a larger “mother rover.” The smaller rover would then venture into any especially uncertain territory, such as a cave or lava tubes, deploying sensors the size of an AirPods case like bread crumbs as it goes.</p>





<p>The sensors could then communicate with each other via a wireless network and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117723001187?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funnel any collected data back to the mother rover</a>, theoretical physicist Wolfgang Fink and colleagues propose February 11 in <em>Advances in Space Research</em>. As proof of concept, the team built prototype sensors that communicate via Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>It’s not that the smaller rover would be following the “bread crumbs” back the way it came. Instead, “we use [the sensors] for the data to find its way communication-wise out of the cave to the mother rover,” says Fink, of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>The technology could also be useful here on Earth, especially after a natural disaster such as an earthquake. A rover could be sent with the deployable sensors into rubble where it’s too dangerous for people to perform <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/designing-robots-help-disaster">search-and-rescue missions</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/14</em>).</p>



<p>The bread crumb–like communication network could allow researchers to “cater to the essence of scientific exploration,” Fink says, by allowing rovers to overcome some of the constraints posed by tricky terrain. “To get to the real exciting science, you most of the time have to go to exotic places, hard-to-get-to places.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mice-anxiety-brain-heart-emotion">In mice, anxiety isn’t all in the head. It can start in the heart</a></h4>

              
                <p>When you’re stressed and anxious, you might feel your heart race. Is your heart racing because you’re afraid? Or does your speeding heart itself contribute to your anxiety? Both could be true, a new study in mice suggests.</p>



<p>By artificially increasing the heart rates of mice, scientists were able to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05748-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase anxiety-like behaviors</a> — ones that the team then calmed by turning off a particular part of the brain. The study, published in the March 9 <em>Nature</em>, shows that in high-risk contexts, a racing heart could go to your head and increase anxiety. The findings could offer a new angle for studying and, potentially, treating anxiety disorders.</p>





<p>The idea that body sensations might contribute to emotions in the brain goes back at least to one of the founders of psychology, William James, says Karl Deisseroth, a neuroscientist at Stanford University. In James’ 1890 book <em>The Principles of Psychology</em>, he put forward the idea that emotion follows what the body experiences. “We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble,” James wrote.</p>



<p>The brain certainly can sense internal body signals, a phenomenon called interoception. But whether those sensations — like a racing heart — can contribute to emotion is difficult to prove, says Anna Beyeler, a neuroscientist at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Bordeaux. She studies brain circuitry related to emotion and wrote a commentary on the new study but was not involved in the research. “I&#8217;m sure a lot of people have thought of doing these experiments, but no one really had the tools,” she says.</p>



<p>Deisseroth has spent his career developing those tools. He is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-neuroscience-optogenetics-nerve-cells-light">one of the scientists who developed</a> optogenetics — a technique that uses viruses to modify the genes of specific cells to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/let-there-be-light-1">respond to bursts of light</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/21</em>; <em>SN: 1/15/10</em>). Scientists can use the flip of a light switch to activate or suppress the activity of those cells.</p>

<p>In the new study, Deisseroth and his colleagues used a light attached to a tiny vest over a mouse’s genetically engineered heart to change the animal’s heart rate. When the light was off, a mouse’s heart pumped at about 600 beats per minute. But when the team turned on a light that flashed at 900 beats per minutes, the mouse’s heartbeat followed suit. “It’s a nice reasonable acceleration, [one a mouse] would encounter in a time of stress or fear,” Deisseroth explains.</p>



<p>When the mice felt their hearts racing, they showed anxiety-like behavior. In risky scenarios — like open areas where a little mouse might be someone’s lunch — the rodents slunk along the walls and lurked in darker corners. When pressing a lever for water that could sometimes be coupled with a mild shock, mice with normal heart rates still pressed without hesitation. But mice with racing hearts decided they’d rather go thirsty.</p>



<p>“Everybody was expecting that, but it&#8217;s the first time that it has been clearly demonstrated,” Beyeler says.</p>





<p>The researchers also scanned the animals’ brains to find areas that might be processing the increased heart rate. One of the biggest signals, Deisseroth says, came from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/uncertainty-stressful-not-always-bad-thing">posterior insula</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/16</em>). “The insula was interesting because it&#8217;s highly connected with interoceptive circuitry,” he explains. “When we saw that signal, [our] interest was definitely piqued.”</p>



<p>Using more optogenetics, the team reduced activity in the posterior insula, which decreased the mice’s anxiety-like behaviors. The animals’ hearts still raced, but they behaved more normally, spending some time in open areas of mazes and pressing levers for water without fear.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This video shows a mouse’s heart beating normally. Then, when a light is switched and flickers at a speedy tempo, the heart follows the rhythm and starts to race.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&nbsp;A lot of people are very excited about the work, says Wen Chen, the branch chief of basic medicine research for complementary and integrative health at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health in Bethesda, Md. “No matter what kind of meetings I go into, in the last two days, everybody brought up this paper,” says Chen, who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>The next step, Deisseroth says, is to look at other parts of the body that might affect anxiety. “We can feel it in our gut sometimes, or we can feel it in our neck or shoulders,” he says. Using optogenetics to tense a mouse’s muscles, or give them tummy butterflies, might reveal other pathways that produce fearful or anxiety-like behaviors.</p>



<p>Understanding the link between heart and head could eventually factor into how doctors treat panic and anxiety, Beyeler says. But the path between the lab and the clinic, she notes, is much more convoluted than that of the heart to the head.</p>

<p><strong>Author: </strong>Thiago Carvalho</p>



<p>In December of 2022, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) hosted a meeting on &ldquo;<a href="https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/conferences/recognizing-preprint-peer-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recognizing Preprint Peer Review</a>&rdquo; at their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.janelia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelia Research Campus</a>&nbsp;in Virginia.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/editors-and-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Review Commons</a></em>&nbsp;was represented by project leader Thomas Lemberger and managing editor Sara Monaco (<a href="https://www.embo.org/press-releases/howard-hughes-medical-institute-funds-the-preprint-review-platform-review-commons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HHMI supports&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em></a>). The meeting also featured a look at our platform from the perspective of affiliate journals, presented by Marcel LaFlamme, Open Research Manager at the&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Public Library of Science</a>&nbsp;(PLOS). LaFlamme originally trained as a cultural anthropologist &ndash; during his postdoc, he studied how scientific organizations can promote open science and collaboration. As LaFlamme told us, PLOS is &ldquo;increasingly thinking about how to advance open science beyond the published article.&rdquo; We discussed how peer reviewed preprints can contribute to this goal, the different uses (and users) of peer review, automated reviewing and more.</p>



<p><strong>Could you tell us a bit about the pros and cons of&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;from the perspective of affiliate journals?</strong></p>



<p>One of the advantages of&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;from PLOS&rsquo;s perspective is efficiency. We&rsquo;re always asking ourselves: How can we provide better service to authors? How do we make that time from submission through decision to publication quicker? This is something that authors tell us is really important and that Review Commons helps us to achieve. Decreasing the burden on the reviewer pool is a second thing that benefits both journals and the scientific community; trying to cut down on those endless cycles of resubmission is something that we think is good for science. One fewer request that our reviewers are getting from a PLOS journal frees up capacity elsewhere in the reviewer pool to do other things.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Trying to cut down on those endless cycles of resubmission is something that we think is good for science.</p><cite>Marcel LaFlamme</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Those are the two concrete advantages of&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>, in the here and now. I think a third advantage, one that is still coming into being, is the way that&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;begins to decouple evaluation from publication or dissemination of research. That&rsquo;s something that we are increasingly talking about at PLOS: what does it mean to decouple those functions and to configure them in different ways?</p>



<p>At the Janelia meeting, I also talked a little bit about challenges for editors. The big take-away was that an editor is not an editor is not an editor. We really need to understand editor concerns and challenges in the context of the editorial model and workflow of the journal that they work on. I think the PLOS portfolio is a good place to look at that because we have journals that are edited in quite different ways: by professional staff editors, by active researchers who are serving as editors-in-chief, and &ndash; for PLOS ONE &ndash; by Associate Editors who are researchers and who may serve as handling editor for just one paper a year. We are really paying attention to the differences in those positionalities and the different concerns that may emerge from those viewpoints.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think there are additional ways that PLOS could contribute to&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>?</strong></p>



<p>We are very open to thinking about what that looks like. There&rsquo;s one conversation that affiliate journals are having around the reviewer pool. To date, EMBO Press has anchored the initial review process for&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>. This leverages the excellent reviewer pool that EMBO has at its disposal, but it also incorporates the limitations of scope of EMBO (or any other single publisher). So, there&rsquo;s a conversation about how to broaden that initial reviewer pool to access different types of expertise and whether PLOS could have role in that.</p>



<p>There are broader questions, too. If we are starting to think about peer review as a service&mdash;which I think is one way we can talk about&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;&mdash; then we might also ask, to whom is it a service? So far,&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;has been a service to authors on the one hand, to have this refereed preprint, but then also a service to the affiliate journals. At PLOS we think these two pieces are valuable but would also ask: who else might peer review as a service be directed towards? Could that be funders? Could that be institutions? The exact form that this takes and how PLOS or&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;fits into it&hellip; I think we&rsquo;re still in the early days of figuring that out. But&nbsp;<em>Review Commons</em>&nbsp;has posed a very important question by offering peer review as a service and cinching it up with existing editorial processes, which is something that not all preprint review services have been as successful at doing to date.</p>



<p><strong>Do different editors assess the quality of reviews in different ways, and what does this say about how we should assess the quality of peer review overall?</strong></p>



<p>As we see more of this decoupling of dissemination and evaluation, we may be asking peer review to do new things. We may be asking it to contextualize research for non-expert audiences who wouldn&rsquo;t be able to read a manuscript and draw the same or similar conclusions as the expert reviewers. In a world where peer review is not only being used to make an up-or-down editorial decision but also to contextualize work that exists in public and is there for people to engage with, then I think what quality looks like &mdash; if that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re asking peer review to do &mdash; is a bit different from what it looked like in that legacy context.</p>



<p><strong>As we ask peer review to do more and more things, should we also be looking at new ways to recognize the work of reviewers?</strong></p>



<p>Another way to ask that question is: should outputs other than published articles and big grants count toward research assessment and the development of scientific careers? I think the answer to that is definitely yes. One thing that PLOS is increasingly interested in from a policy perspective is how existing systems of research assessment that overvalue the research article and the big grant can serve as a structural barrier to open science. This is something that we are thinking about as an organization: how do we enable evidence-based decision making about how research assessment can change to properly reward and credit a broader range of research outputs?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Should outputs other than published articles and big grants count toward research assessment and the development of scientific careers? I think the answer to that is definitely yes.</p><cite>Marcel LaFlamme</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Peer review is one piece of that but sharing data and other outputs fall into this category as well. How you do this, how you credit reviews, is hard. There&rsquo;s one approach that is about counting and weighting the number of reviews and how much different sorts of review should count. There is another approach that is about making the reviews themselves visible and enabling different kinds of assessment, both qualitative and scalable, machine-driven assessment of the text of the reviews themselves. PLOS has taken the latter approach for some time, by giving our authors and reviewers the option to make reviews public and to share reviewer identities. I think these forms of sharing, in and of themselves, are not reward or credit, but they may be a precondition for a proper system of reward or credit.</p>



<p><strong>Can peer review be automated?</strong></p>



<p>At PLOS we are interested in the complementarity of expert human peer review and automated approaches. Last year there was a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06080-6" target="_blank">commentary published</a>&nbsp;on the question &ldquo;is the future of peer review automated?&rdquo; &ndash; a very provocative title. The conclusion of the piece&mdash;and its authors included folks who are building software and who have a stake in the answer to that question being &ldquo;yes&rdquo; &mdash; was that a complementary approach is what we need. The technology is nowhere near the point where the application of human judgment could be sidelined. But automation can be used to check compliance with guidelines and checklists, or to detect the presence of&nbsp;<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">related research outputs</a>; these are things that machine scoring can likely do better than a human editor who is doing them for a high volume of manuscripts, day in and day out.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780262047876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Particle</a><br><em>Alan Chodos and James Riordon</em><br><em>MIT Press, $32.95</em></p>



<p>We live in a sea of neutrinos. Every second, trillions of them pass through our bodies. They come from the sun, nuclear reactors, collisions of cosmic rays hitting Earth’s atmosphere, even the Big Bang. Among fundamental particles, only photons are more numerous. Yet because neutrinos barely interact with matter, they are notoriously difficult to detect.</p>



<p>The existence of the neutrino was first proposed in the 1930s and then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/neutrino-now-detected">verified in the 1950s</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/54</em>). Decades later, much about the neutrino — named in part because it has no electric charge — remains a mystery, including how many varieties of neutrinos exist, how much mass they have, where that mass comes from and whether they have any magnetic properties.</p>





<p>These mysteries are at the heart of <em>Ghost Particle</em> by physicist Alan Chodos and science journalist James Riordon. The book is an informative, easy-to-follow introduction to the perplexing particle. Chodos and Riordon guide readers through how the neutrino was discovered, what we know — and don’t know — about it, and the ongoing and future experiments that (fingers crossed) will provide the answers.</p>



<p>It’s not just neutrino physicists who await those answers. Neutrinos, Riordon says, “are incredibly important both for understanding the universe and our existence in it.” Unmasking the neutrino could be key to unlocking the nature of dark matter, for instance. Or it could clear up the universe’s matter conundrum: The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter, the oppositely charged counterparts of electrons, protons and so on. When matter and antimatter come into contact, they annihilate each other. So in theory, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">the universe today should be empty</a> — yet it’s not (<em>SN: 9/22/22</em>). It’s filled with matter and, for some reason, very little antimatter.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Riordon, a frequent contributor to the magazine, about these puzzles and how neutrinos could act as a tool to observe the cosmos or even see into our own planet. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>In the first chapter, you list eight unanswered questions about neutrinos. Which is the most pressing to answer?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Riordon: </strong>Whether they’re their own antiparticles is probably one of the grandest. The proposal that neutrinos are their own antiparticles is an elegant solution to all sorts of problems, including the existence of this residue of matter we live in. Another one is figuring out how neutrinos fit in the standard model [of particle physics]. It’s one of the most successful theories there is, but it can’t explain the fact that neutrinos have mass.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Why is now a good time to write a book about neutrinos?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Riordon: </strong>All of these questions about neutrinos are sort of coming to a head right now — the hints that neutrinos may be their own antiparticles, the issues of neutrinos not quite fitting the standard model, whether there are sterile neutrinos [a hypothetical neutrino that is a candidate for dark matter]. In the next few years, a decade or so, there will be a lot of experiments that will [help answer these questions,] and the resolution either way will be exciting.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Neutrinos could also be used to help scientists observe a range of phenomena. What are some of the most interesting questions neutrinos could help with?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Riordon: </strong>There are some observations that simply have to be done with neutrinos, that there are no other technological alternatives for. There’s a problem with using light-based telescopes to look back in history. We have this really amazing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">James Webb Space Telescope</a> that can see really far back in history. But at some point, when you go far enough back, the universe is basically opaque to light; you can’t see into it. Once we narrow down how to detect and how to measure the cosmic neutrino background [neutrinos that formed less than a second after the Big Bang], it will be a way to look back at the very beginning. Other than with gravitational waves, you can’t see back that far with anything else. So it’ll give us sort of a telescope back to the beginning of the universe.</p>



<p>The other thing is, when a supernova happens, all kinds of really cool stuff happens inside, and you can see it with neutrinos because neutrinos come out immediately in a burst. We call it the “cosmic neutrino bomb,” but you can track the supernova as it’s going along. With light, it takes a while for it to get out [of the stellar explosion]. We’re due for a [nearby] supernova. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-nearby-star-goes-supernova-scientists-will-be-ready">We haven’t had one since 1987</a>. It was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/30-year-anniversary-supernova-1987a">last visible supernova in the sky</a> and was a boon for research. Now that we have neutrino detectors around the world, this next one is going to be even better [for research], even more exciting.</p>



<p>And if we develop better instrumentation, we could use neutrinos to understand what’s going on in the center of the Earth. There’s no other way that you could probe the center of the Earth. We use seismic waves, but the resolution is really low. So we could resolve a lot of questions about what the planet is made of with neutrinos.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>Do you have a favorite “character” in the story of neutrinos?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Riordon: </strong>I’m certainly very fond of my grandfather Clyde Cowan [he and Frederick Reines were the first physicists to detect neutrinos]. But Reines is a riveting character. He was poetic. He was a singer. He really was this creative force. I mentioned [in the book] that they put this “SNEWS” sign on their detector for “supernova early warning system,” which sort of echoed the ballistic missile early warning systems at the time [during the Cold War]. That’s so ripe.</p>

<p>Last August 12th, Nick Wise came across a Facebook post advertising the first, third, and fifth author positions for sale on a scientific paper with the same title as a recently published article.</p>

The evidence gathered by IOP Publishing to date considerably reduces confidence in the work, to the extent that IOP Publishing has made the decision to retract the work.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We emailed Hamzah Kzar, the paper’s corresponding author whose affiliation is listed as the veterinary medicine college at Al-Qasim Green University in Iraq, but haven’t heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Wise told us that the time it took IOP to retract the paper “seems reasonable when the authors have to have the chance to explain themselves,” but also said that the retraction “highlights how scientific publishing doesn’t appear to have a response yet to systematic abuse of the publishing process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, Wise noted, Maria Jade Catalan Opulencia, one of the authors of the retracted paper whose affiliation is listed as the college of business administration at Ajman University in the United Arab Emirates, “suddenly published over 50 papers last year, despite having barely published before, and many of them have <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=maria+opulencia">matching Facebook adverts on Pubpeer</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opulencia is listed as a coauthor on <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dOpulencia%252c%2bMaria%2bJade%2bCatalan">three additional retracted papers</a> about cancer biology, fuel cells, and nanoelectronics for which Wise <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/624D9180023576F8DE5F68BF4CC7E7#2">identified</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/87471B463BB5315515BF7FA37C183D#2">authorships</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F04D5D1085384DCDEC0AD77244FA1E#1">for sale</a>. Her most recent paper <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=DUuqJDAAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=DUuqJDAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C">on Google Scholar</a> indicates it was published in <em>Linguistica Antverpiensa</em>, a Belgian linguistics journal that we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/07/the-whack-a-mole-problem-hijacked-journal-still-being-indexed-in-scopus-even-after-discovery/">previously reported</a> had been targeted by hijackers attempting to sneak paper mill manuscripts into databases like Scopus under the auspices of a legitimate journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wise told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am pretty sure that all of her articles from last year had authorship sold, but as it stands every single one will have to have an individual investigation lasting months. Surely publishers should investigate all her articles, without someone needing to find a matching advert, email the editor and hope for a response.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Opulencia has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Wise also noted that Salim Kallel, who had posted the advertisement about the recently retracted paper, had continued sharing “call[s] for co-authorship!!” on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100069291131516">public Facebook page</a> until as recently as the end of February, though he had stopped including enough specific information for Wise to find the published papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We contacted Kallel via the WhatsApp number listed on his recent ads and asked about his posts. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All information is confidential and I don&#8217;t have the right to disclose any information about my clients.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kallel also said he had stopped posting recently because “I don&#8217;t work more with that.” He has a new baby to take care of, he told us, and doesn’t expect to go back to the business.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-trek-chaco-canyon-hauled-logs">Two scientists’ trek showed how people of Chaco Canyon may have hauled logs</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the morning sun peeked through the trees, Rodger Kram readied himself for the coming marathon. But not the kind he used to run.</p>



<p>Kram, a physiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, stood next to undergrad James Wilson at the end of a rural dirt road. Each donned a strap of nylon webbing onto his head. Attached to the bottom of their straps — called tumplines — a log rested horizontally across the duo’s lower backs.</p>





<p>The pair was about to embark on a 25-kilometer trek to replicate how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chaco-canyons-ancient-civilization-continues-puzzle">ancient people of Chaco Canyon</a> may have transported timber around 1,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/17/17</em>). By the end of the day, their successful journey suggested that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2023.103876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it would have taken just a few days for three people with tumplines to carry a full-size timber to Chaco</a>, Kram, Wilson and colleagues reported on February 22 in the <em>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Located in the northwest corner of New Mexico, Chaco Canyon is home to grand structures built between A.D. 850 and 1200. Multistoried stone buildings called great houses had roofs with timber beams about 5 meters long and 22 centimeters in diameter. The site contained at least 200,000 timbers of this size.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1.jpg" alt="A photo of the ruins of a great house in the Chaco Culture National Historical Park." class="wp-image-3122506" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030323_MP_chaco_inline-1-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122506">The ruins of this great house in Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico are part of Pueblo Bonito, a complex considered the center of Chacoan society.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122506">John Elk III/The Image Bank/Getty Images Plus</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But the wood <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/isotopes-reveal-sources-ancient-timbers">came from forests more than 75 kilometers away</a> (<em>SN: 9/26/01</em>). Load-pulling animals and wheels weren’t there at the time, and the timbers don’t appear to have been dragged. Scientists are puzzled by how the ancient people, ancestors of modern-day Diné and Pueblo peoples, moved the large timbers.</p>



<p>A 1986 study suggested that <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/prehistoric-longdistance-transport-of-construction-beams-chaco-canyon-new-mexico/7E9FBAE6AE3F055D58746D1A707947F0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">each log used as a beam had a mass of 275 kilograms</a>. But Kram suspected this number couldn’t be correct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016, he cut a section of a tree outside of his house — ponderosa pine, the same species used in Chaco — and weighed it on his bathroom scale. He then extrapolated that a 5-meter-long timber would be closer to 90 kilograms. This revelation led to a 2022 study <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00231940.2022.2102841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recalculating the masses of the Chaco Canyon timbers as between 85 and 140 kilograms</a>.</p>



<p>“As soon as we figured out that the weight was reasonable, I wanted to carry them,” Kram says.</p>



<p>He and Wilson proposed that tumplines could have been used to transport the timbers. These head straps have been found on every inhabited continent and are thought to have been used since at least around 2,000 years ago. They are still widely used to carry heavy loads, such as by professional porters in Nepal. A tumpline is placed on the crown of the head — to be in line with the cervical spine — with the attached cargo resting on the small of the back.</p>

<p>While there is no evidence that the people of Chaco used tumplines to haul timbers, there is proof that they used them to transport other items, like water vessels.</p>



<p>To see if tumpline timber transportation was humanly possible, Kram and Wilson trained for three months during the summer of 2020, gradually increasing their load weight and walk duration. Strangers who passed by couldn’t hide their confusion.</p>





<p>On the final day, the pair walked 25 kilometers while carrying a ponderosa pine that had been air-dried, which is how the people of Chaco may have prepared timbers. The 60-kilogram log was 2.5 meters long and 24 centimeters in diameter. The entire trek took almost 10 hours, and the weight of the full timber only slightly slowed the duo’s pace.</p>



<p>“I felt happy at the end that it was proved feasible, and that the 132-pound log we shared was off our necks,” says Wilson, now a medical student at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora. But “I never really doubted that we could do it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bee-honeybees-waggle-dance-communicate-lessons-learn-hive">Honeybees waggle to communicate. But to do it well, they need dance lessons</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a castaway test setup, groups of young honeybees figuring out how to forage on their own start waggle dancing spontaneously — but badly.</p>



<p>Waggling matters. A honeybee’s rump-shimmy runs and turning loops encode clues that help her colony mates fly to food she has found, sometimes kilometers away. However, five&nbsp; colonies in the new test had no older sisters or half-sisters around as role models for getting the dance moves right.</p>



<p>Still, dances improved in some ways as the youngsters wiggled and looped day after day, reports behavioral ecologist James Nieh of the University of California, San Diego. But when waggling the clues for distance information, <em>Apis mellifera</em> without role models never did match the timing and coding in normal colonies where young bees practiced with older foragers before doing the main waggle themselves.</p>





<p>The youngsters-only colonies thus show that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade1702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social learning, or the lack of it, matters for communicating by dance</a> among honeybees, Nieh and an international team of colleagues say in the March 10 <em>Science</em>. Bee waggle dancing, a sort of language, turns out to be both innate and learned, like songbird or human communication.</p>



<p>The dance may appear simple in a diagram, but executing it on expanses of honeycomb cells gets challenging. Bees are “running forward at over one body length per second in the pitch black trying to keep the correct angle, surrounded by hundreds of bees that are crowding them,” Nieh says.</p>



<p>Beekeepers and biologists know that some kinds of bees can learn from others of their kind — some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/score-bumblebees-football-insect-social-learning">bumblebees even tried soccer</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/17</em>). But when it comes to waggle dancing, “I think people have assumed it’s genetic,” Nieh says. That would make this fancy footwork more like the chatty but innate communications of cuttlefish color change, for instance. The lab bee-castaway experiments instead show a nonhuman example of “social learning for sophisticated communication,” Nieh says.</p>



<p>Testing for social learning took some elaborate beekeeping. At an apiary research center in Kunming, China, researchers put thousands of nearly grown-up honeybees (at what’s called the purple-eyed pupae stage) into incubators and then collected the brand-new winged adults when they emerged.</p>



<p>These youngsters went into five weirdly populated colonies of same-age worker newbies. Each colony got a queen, who would lay eggs but not leave the colony to forage. Food had to come from the young workforce, with no older, experienced foragers buzzing in and dancing the locations of flowers.</p>



<p>In waggle dancing, foraging bees have to master not only the moves but the obstacles of the honeycomb dance floor. A cell may be empty. “It’s just the edges to hang on to…. It would be easy to stumble,” Nieh says. Unlike commercial hives with manufactured uniform honeycomb cells, natural combs “are very irregular,” he says. “Along the edges, they get a bit crazy and rough.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A honeybee that brings home food to her colony does a looping, waggling dance that tells her colony mates how to find the source. In the center, a bee with a green dot on her back is doing her first waggle dance as other bees crowd around. She’s already gotten to follow along with dances by other experienced foragers, so she makes fairly regular figure eights. Bees that don’t have such mentors don’t nail the dance moves as well, a new study shows.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dances on these treacherous surfaces encode the food’s direction in the angle a dancer waggles across the comb (measured relative to gravity). Duration of waggling bout gives a clue on how far away the bonanza is.</p>





<p>The five colonies of castaways were left to figure out dancing on their own, in contrast to five other colonies in the apiary with a natural mix. Early in the experiments, researchers recorded and analyzed the first dances of five bees from each hive.</p>



<p>Even in the mixed-age hives, the dancers didn’t get the angle perfect every time. The extremes in a set of six waggle runs might differ by a bit more than 30 degrees. The castaway hives, though, had far more trouble at first. Two of the five castaway dancers’ angles veered more than 50 degrees apart, and one poor bee strayed more than 60 degrees in six repeats.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Waggle dancing lets honeybees share news about where to find food. The honeybee marked with a purple dot that’s making irregular figure eight loops in the center did not have older, experienced foragers around to lead her in practice dances. As a result, her first dance is rough and other bees seem to be colliding with her as much as following her. A study comparing bees with and without dance mentors suggests that this sophisticated communication is a mix of innate and learned behavior.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the castaways got more experience, they got better though. Repeating the test with the same marked bees a few weeks later near the end of their lives found them angling about as well as dancers in a normal hive.</p>



<p>What the castaways didn’t change much were dance features that encode distance to food. Researchers had set up the hives so that all would have the same experience of flying the distance to a feeder. Yet castaway bees persisted in dancing as if it were farther.</p>



<p>They gave more rump wags per waggle run (closer to five wags) than bees from mixed-age hives (more like 3.5 wags). The youngsters also took longer on each run.</p>



<p>Evidence like this foraging study is “indeed accumulating for the importance of learning (whether individual or social) in the complex behaviors of bees,” insect ecophysiologist Tamar Keasar of the University of Haifa in Israel says in an email. In her own work, she sees bees learning to extract food from complicated flowers. Bees aren’t, after all, just little automatons with wings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkey-stone-flakes-ancient-hominid-tools">Some monkeys accidentally make stone flakes that resemble ancient hominid tools</a></h4>

              
                <p>Monkeys in southern Thailand use rocks to pound open oil palm nuts, inadvertently shattering stone pieces off their makeshift nutcrackers. These flakes resemble some sharp-edged stone tools presumed to have been created on purpose by ancient hominids, researchers say.</p>



<p>Thailand’s long-tailed macaques (<em>Macaca fascicularis</em>) produce shards that could easily be mistaken for stone flakes previously found at 17 East African hominid sites dating from about 3.3 million to 1.56 million years ago, say archaeologist Tomos Proffitt and colleagues. The finding suggests that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade8159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ancient hominids may sometimes have created the stone flakes by accident</a> while using rocks to smash nuts, bones or other objects, the scientists report March 10 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Previous research has already shown that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-monkeys-throw-curve-stone-tool-makings-origins">rock-wielding capuchin monkeys in Brazil</a> unwittingly produce hominid-like stone flakes (<em>SN: 10/19/16</em>).</p>



<p>Observations of rock bashing by these two monkey species undermine a long-standing assumption that hominids must have intentionally made certain ancient stone flakes, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-genus-earliest-stone-tool-artifacts-ethiopia-contested">some of the earliest known examples of tools</a>, Proffitt says (<em>SN: 6/3/19</em>). It’s time to reevaluate how such determinations are made, he contends.</p>



<p>Proffitt’s group identified 219 complete and fragmented stone flakes at 40 macaque nut-cracking sites on the island where the monkeys live. The team also found rocks showing damage consistent with having been used either as pounding implements or pounding platforms.</p>

Adv.</em> 2023, Technological Primates Research Group/Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some differences do exist between macaque and hominid stone flakes, says Proffitt, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. For instance, many macaque flakes display battering damage on only one side, versus frequent two-sided damage on hominid artifacts.</p>



<p>Such clues may help archaeologists develop guidelines for estimating whether ancient hominids made stone flakes on purpose or by accident, Proffitt suspects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammogram-dense-breast-cancer">My mammogram revealed I have dense breasts. What does that mean?</a></h4>

              
                <p>After a mammogram, you may have gotten a letter in the mail that starts something like this: “Your mammogram indicates that you have dense breast tissue.” When I got that letter, I wasn’t sure what it meant for me or what, if anything, I should do about it. Off the letter went to a stack of other “nonurgent” mail to think about later.</p>



<p>Later has turned into now. That’s because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/10/2023-04550/mammography-quality-standards-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new rule on breast density notifications</a>, part of an update to mammography regulations. Published March 10, the rule makes these letters a nationwide requirement and standardizes the information conveyed in them. Previously, 38 states notified people with dense breasts or provided information about breast density after a mammogram. The new rule, which goes into effect September 10, 2024, means everyone who has had a mammogram will be informed whether their breasts are dense or not.</p>





<p>Why do people need to know this? If you just want the take-home message, here it is: Having dense breasts modestly increases the risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer. But breast density is just <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2737316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one factor among others to be considered</a> when figuring out a person’s overall risk. Having dense breasts doesn’t mean you will get breast cancer, and not having dense breasts doesn’t mean you’re in the clear.</p>



<p>Ideally, receiving a notification about breast density would prompt a detailed discussion about breast cancer risk with a doctor. This column can’t replace that. But read on if you’d like to learn more about dense breasts and why the focus on them is a bit of a blunt instrument.</p>



<h4>What are dense breasts?</h4>



<p>Breasts are made up of different kinds of tissue: glandular tissue, which produces milk and directs it to the nipple, plus connective (fibrous) tissue and fatty tissue. Dense breasts have more glandular and connective tissue than fatty tissue.</p>



<p>Having dense breasts “isn’t abnormal,” says internist and epidemiologist Joann Elmore at UCLA. Dense breasts are common too: Around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6579740/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 percent of women ages 40 to 79 in the United States have them</a>, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> in 2019.</p>



<p>A radiologist visually assesses the density of breast tissue from a mammogram. The two non-dense classifications are “almost entirely fatty” and “scattered areas of fibroglandular density,” which means mainly fatty tissue with some areas of dense tissue. Around 8 and 46 percent of U.S. women ages 40 to 79 have those two classifications, respectively.</p>



<p>The two dense categories are “heterogeneously dense” and “extremely dense,” with an estimated 40 percent and 6 percent of U.S. women 40 to 79 in those categories, respectively. The two dense categories are usually lumped together and called “dense breasts.” Under the new FDA rule, that’s how notification letters will be written: that the person’s breast tissue is “dense” or “not dense.”</p>

<p>One more thing: Breast density can change. For example, older women tend to have less dense breasts than younger women. And sometimes a person will be switched from “dense” to “not dense” or vice versa, depending on the <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e18772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiologist reading the mammogram</a> and deciding between the “scattered areas of density” and “heterogeneously dense” categories.</p>



<h4>OK, so why do I need to know if I have dense breasts?</h4>





<p>Dense breasts pose two problems. First, on a mammogram, glandular and connective tissue show up as white — which is how tumors or other abnormal breast tissue look too. So dense tissue could hide the very things a radiologist is looking for.</p>



<p>One measure of how well a mammogram works is sensitivity, the proportion of tumors detected by the mammogram out of all the diagnosed tumors (whether found by mammogram or not). An analysis of mammograms from a Dutch screening program found that for those with nearly all fatty tissue, sensitivity was 86 percent, and for scattered areas of density, it was 78 percent. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sensitivity continued to drop</a> with greater density: 70 percent for heterogeneously dense breasts and 61 percent for extremely dense breasts, researchers reported in <em>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</em> in 2017.</p>



<p>Second, dense tissue itself contributes to cancer risk. This may be related to the greater amount of glandular tissue in dense breasts. “Breast cancers almost always develop in the glandular tissue,” says Priscilla Slanetz, a breast radiologist at Boston Medical Center.</p>



<h4>How much do dense breasts increase the risk of a breast cancer diagnosis?</h4>



<p>Modestly. Dense breasts “elevate you above the average person a little bit,” Slanetz says. An average person is someone with no known risk factors for developing breast cancer.</p>



<p>Researchers compared the risk of developing breast cancer in those with dense breasts with the most common non-dense category, scattered areas of density. Premenopausal women with heterogeneously dense breasts are at <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/29/10/2048/124441/Breast-Cancer-Population-Attributable-Risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.5 to 1.8 times greater risk of developing breast cancer</a>, depending on race and ethnicity. Those with extremely dense breasts are at 1.8 to 2.4 times greater risk. For postmenopausal women, the risk was 1.3 to 1.6 times higher for heterogeneously dense breasts and 1.5 to 2 times higher for extremely dense breasts, researchers reported in <em>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s another way to try to explain the risk, from a hypothetical case study of a <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-1822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47-year-old woman who has heterogeneously dense breasts</a> and no family history of breast cancer. Among 1,000 women like the one in the case study with heterogeneously dense breasts, an estimated 20 will develop breast cancer in the following 10 years. That’s compared with 13 of 1,000 like the case study woman but with the most common non-dense category.</p>



<p>It’s also important to know that breast density is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/104/16/1218/910763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not associated with a higher risk of dying</a> from breast cancer, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> in 2012. The analysis of more than 9,000 women with breast cancer suggests that what contributes to developing cancer differs from what affects the risk of dying from breast cancer. A different group of researchers also reported in 2018 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5885304/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no association between breast density and breast cancer death</a>.</p>



<h4>What other factors should I be aware of regarding breast cancer risk?</h4>



<p>Dense breasts are just one part of the risk picture. The two most significant risk factors for developing breast cancer are being female and increasing age, Slanetz says.</p>



<p>About 1 in 8, or 13 percent, of cisgender women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. An estimated <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">297,790 new cases of breast cancer in women</a> are expected in 2023. Males <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/men-with-breast-cancer-have-lower-survival-rates-than-women">account for less than 1 in 100 cases</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/19</em>). And risk goes up as birthdays do: On average, while <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/risk-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 65 women starting at age 40</a> will develop breast cancer in the next 10 years, 1 in 24 women starting at age 70 will, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p>



<p>There are also racial disparities in breast cancer risk. Despite having a slightly lower incidence of breast cancer than white women, Black women have a <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21754" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent higher risk of death</a>: 28 per 100,000 Black women die of breast cancer in the United States compared with 20 per 100,000 white women. Black women are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6941147/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age</a>, have more aggressive disease and are diagnosed at a later stage of cancer, all of which contribute to a poorer prognosis. Inequities in <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/EDBK_319929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access to cancer therapies</a> and surgical treatment contribute to the disparity.</p>



<p>There is less breast cancer data for transgender men and women. Researchers have found that transgender men have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower rates of breast cancer</a> than cisgender women, which appears to be related to the surgical removal of breasts and the use of testosterone. Transgender women have a reduced risk of breast cancer compared with cisgender women due to less exposure to the hormone estrogen over their lives, although estrogen therapy can increase the risk.</p>



<p>Among the factors that greatly increase the risk of developing breast cancer are the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genetic mutations. About 7 in 10 carriers of one of the mutations will have breast cancer by the age of 80. Women who received radiation therapy to the chest as children are also at high risk. These two groups have specific breast cancer screening recommendations.</p>



<p>Online breast cancer risk calculators can help doctors estimate a person’s risk. After adding up their risk factors, people are considered high risk if they have a 20 percent or greater chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. The American College of Radiology recommends that mammograms <a href="https://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440(17)31524-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin at age 30 for those</a> at high risk, supplemented with breast magnetic resonance imaging. The ACR also recommends that Black women be evaluated for breast cancer risk no later than the age of 30.</p>



<p>People with dense breasts — as well as those without, and anyone who is at average risk or a bit above average — should still get screening mammograms, doctors say. Medical organizations have some variation in their <a href="https://jnccn.org/view/journals/jnccn/16/11/article-p1398.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screening recommendations</a> regarding what age to begin and whether to get mammograms annually or every other year.</p>



<h4>What should I do if I have dense breasts?</h4>



<p>There aren’t recommendations specific to dense breasts to guide people or their doctors. People should have information about their breast density, says Ilana Richman, a general internist at the Yale School of Medicine. “But it is an open question what to do with that information,” she says, because of the lack of guidelines.</p>



<p>Some states’ notifications have suggested people with dense breasts might benefit from supplemental screening with a different imaging technology, such as MRI or ultrasound. With the new FDA rule, notifications will say that in some people with dense tissue, adding other imaging tests may help find cancer. However, density alone isn’t enough to bump someone up to the high risk category and a need for supplemental screening, says Karla Kerlikowske, a primary care physician and clinical epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “There’s a lot of people that have dense breasts who are actually at low risk of breast cancer,” she says.</p>



<p>Ideally, a dense breast notification would lead to a discussion with a doctor about different breast cancer risks, to understand a person&#8217;s overall risk. But the limited time allotted to primary care visits in the United States is an obstacle. “We don’t have a system that allows enough time for that nuanced discussion,” says Christina Chapman, a radiation oncologist and health equity researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p>



<p>Plus, that conversation should happen with people who have nondense breasts too, who could still be at high risk. “The focus on breast density in some ways just distracts from the idea that risk is multidimensional,” Richman says.</p>



<p>Many women who develop breast cancer don’t have any apparent risk factors, Slanetz says, which is why screening mammograms are important. “We screen [everyone] because we have to.”</p>

<h4>For good measure</h4>



<p><em>Cutting carbon dioxide emissions to curb climate change and reach net-zero is possible but not easy, <strong>Alexandra Witze</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/net-zero-carbon-emissions-climate">The road to net-zero</a>” (</em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 22<em>).</em></p>



<p>A report by Princeton U­niversity’s Net-Zero America project, released in 2021, estimates that wind and solar power production needs to roughly quadruple by 2030 to achieve the United States’ goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, <strong>Witze</strong> reported. In the most ambitious scenario, “wind turbines would cover an area the size of Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and O­klahoma combined,” she wrote.</p>





<p>Reader <strong>Mary Sweeney </strong>noted that, while technically correct, the statement quoted above could be misleading. “What the Princeton report actually states is that the visual footprint of the turbines would be equivalent to the combined areas of the states listed above. In other words, that figure for land use was reached by considering the very large area from which the very tall turbines would be visible,” <strong>Sweeney</strong> wrote. The actual land use would be only a tiny fraction of the visual footprint.</p>



<h4>Disappearing act</h4>



<p><em>A glass frog hides nearly all of its red blood cells in the liver while it sleeps, upping the animal’s transparency,<strong> Susan Milius</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-glass-frogs-blood-liver">Glass frogs make their blood vanish</a>” (</em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 6<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Len Yaeger</strong> wondered what criteria the researchers used to determine transparency in the frogs.</p>



<p>Biologists think about transparency a bit differently from physicists, says <strong>Jesse Delia</strong> of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “If the individual tissues are transmitting over 90 percent of light, they’re — as far as biology goes — relatively perfectly transparent,” he says. Glass frogs’ green dorsal skin “gives them sort of a diffuse transmittance, like the filtered light if you were to look up at the tree canopy on a sunny day.”</p>





<p>What’s more, the translucence of glass frog skin appears across a continuum. The clearest see-through skin is on the belly, which helps explain why it took <strong>Delia</strong> some years to notice the cell-hiding phenomenon in sleeping frogs. <strong>Delia</strong> had often seen the frogs sleep in the wild, their less-translucent backs facing outward as the frogs clung to leaves. “It wasn’t until I saw them sleeping in captivity on glass that I could actually see their bellies,” he says. From there, “you can see straight in to their organs.”</p>



<p>Since the frogs can pack their red blood cells together without forming clots, reader <strong>Mara Chen-Goldberg</strong> wondered, could the discovery aid research into blood clot treatments for humans?</p>



<p>Many people are asking the same question, <strong>Delia</strong> says. The frogs seem to somehow inhibit the typical vertebrate blood-clotting process. “But at this point, we don’t know whether that mechanism would be directly translatable to human medicine,” he says.</p>



<h4>Correction</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-fox-fish-food-first-video-spain">A cunning fox catches fish, stunning researchers</a>” (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 4</em>) incorrectly stated that fishing in foxes had not been observed before. While the study featured in the story describes the first record of a red fox fishing, a 1991 study published in <em>Polar Research</em> had previously reported fishing in arctic foxes in Greenland. This incorrect fact also appeared in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/these-are-our-favorite-animal-stories-of-2022">a year-end roundup</a> in <em>Science News</em>’ December 17, 2022 &amp; D­ecember 31, 2022 issue.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-with-tools-you-may-be-a-cockatoo">Good with tools? You may be a cockatoo</a></h4>

              
                <p>We humans pride ourselves on our superior smarts, given our ability to make fire, use tools and subscribe to Netflix. But if other animals could counter that presumption, they might say they’re doing just fine, thank you.</p>



<p>The latest entrant in the animal smarts sweepstakes is the Goffin’s cockatoo. Birds in a laboratory in Vienna deployed both a pointy stick and a straw <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoos-tool-kit-national-park">to extract a cashew from a clear box</a>. They used the stick to poke a hole in a paper barrier erected by the scientists, then the straw to knock the cashew free. When scientists removed the paper barrier, some birds left the pointy stick home, staff writer Erin Garcia de Jesús reports. Why tote around more tools than you need?</p>





<p>Wild cockatoos in Indonesia wield three different sticks to break open fruit pits. Other animals, including crows, also use tools but don’t use multiple objects as a toolkit. That puts these cockatoos in the rarefied realm along with chimpanzees as the only non­human animals known to use tool sets.</p>



<p>Last year, Garcia de Jesús reported on another epic cockatoo skill — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoo-open-trash-cans">outwitting humans trying to keep the birds from raiding trash cans</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 10</em>). Many people, myself included, have resorted to using a brick or a bungee to prevent nocturnal snacking by raccoons and opossums. The cockatoos of Sydney would scoff at such a paltry effort. They quickly figured out they could push off a brick. But they were thwarted, at least for now, when humans wedged water bottles or sticks into the bins’ back handles. The birds appear to be learning as the humans invent new defenses.</p>



<p>And lest you think bird brains have a lock on animal smarts,<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-recognize-photo-self-aware"> fish may be able to recognize themselves in photos or a mirror</a>. Researchers in Japan found that when looking in a mirror, bluestreak cleaner wrasses would try to scrape off marks that researchers had put on their bodies. The fish could also distinguish their faces in photos from those of other cleaner fish. Not all scientists are convinced that the fish are self-aware, but piscine partisans say it’s time to give aquatic vertebrates their due, freelance contributor Betsy Mason reports.</p>



<p>That makes sense, given that goldfish can drive. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/goldfish-car-drive-navigation-biology">Researchers in Israel taught six goldfish how to drive a water-filled tank</a> to destinations around a room, we reported last year (<em>SN: 2/12/22, p. 4</em>). The fish were trained to steer toward a pink board on one side of the room and could find it even when researchers moved the board to another wall.</p>



<p>We loved the driving goldfish story so much that we turned it into a comic for <em>Science News Explores</em>, our magazine and website for younger readers. Evidently we weren’t the only people who were charmed. The <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/goldfish-driving-cars-navigation-comic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">navigating fish comic</a>, along with another on the <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/cockatoos-social-learning-culture-garbage-australia-comic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garbage bin–raiding cockatoos</a> and a third about <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/panda-bear-zoo-wild-camouflage-predators-comic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pandas’ camouflage skills</a>, won the top award for science journalism for children in the 2022 AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Awards.</p>



<p>Thank you, animals, for continuing to amaze us, even as you chip away at our smug sense of superiority. Some animals even use computers, including non­human primates who have been trained to use touch screens. It’s only a matter of time before they’re writing editor’s notes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/runaway-black-hole-galaxy-hubble">A runaway black hole has been spotted fleeing a distant galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p>A streak of light stretching away from a remote galaxy might be the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04888v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first sure sign of a gargantuan black hole on the run</a>, a new study reports. The putative black hole, fleeing its host galaxy, appears to be leaving a trail of newborn stars and shocked gas in its wake. If confirmed, the intergalactic escape could help astronomers learn more about what happens to black holes when galaxies collide.</p>



<p>“It’s a very cool, serendipitous discovery,” says astronomer Charlotte Angus of the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved in the new work. “The possibility that this might be due to a supermassive black hole that’s been ejected from its galaxy is very exciting. These events have been predicted by theory, but up until now, there’s been little evidence for them.”</p>





<p>While looking for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-dark-matter-dwarf-galaxies-physics-space">colliding dwarf galaxies</a> with the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomer Pieter van Dokkum and colleagues spotted something peculiar: a long, straight line that seemed to extend away from a distant galaxy, growing narrower and brighter as it went (<em>SN: 5/18/22</em>).</p>



<p>“Whatever it is, we haven’t seen it before,” says van Dokkum, of Yale University. “Most astronomical objects are shaped like a spiral or a blob. There are not many objects that are just a line in the sky.” When astronomers do see lines, they’re usually from something moving, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-spacex-problem-space-pollution">a satellite crossing the telescope’s field of view</a> (<em>SN: 3/3/23</em>).</p>



<p>To figure out what it was, van Dokkum and colleagues took follow-up observations with the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Those observations showed that the streak was associated with a galaxy whose light took about 8 billion years — more than half the age of the universe — to get to Earth, the team reports in a paper submitted February 9 to arXiv.org. The distance measurement let the team calculate the length of the line: roughly 200,000 light-years.</p>



<p>That certainly ruled out a satellite. </p>



<p>“We considered a lot of explanations, and the one that fit the best is what we’re witnessing is a massive object, like a black hole, moving very rapidly away from the galaxy,” van Dokkum says.</p>

<p>Black holes on their own are invisible. But “if a black hole leaves a galaxy, it doesn’t leave by itself,” van Dokkum says. Some of the stars and gas that were gravitationally bound to the black hole leave with it. That gas will emit strong radiation that telescopes can detect. The black hole’s path through the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus">gas and dust in the galaxy’s outer regions</a> can compress some of that gas into new stars, too, which would also be visible (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>Another possibility is that the line is a jet of radiation launched by the galaxy’s central supermassive black hole. But that scenario would probably lead to a beam that is narrow when it is close to the galaxy and broadens as it gets farther away. This streak does the opposite.</p>





<p>If it’s a black hole, it could have been ejected from the galaxy’s center by interacting with one or two other black holes nearby. Almost every galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. When galaxies merge, their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/andromeda-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole-collision-simulation">central black holes also eventually merge</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/21</em>). If the conditions are right, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-gravitational-waves-kick-ligo-merger-spacetime">merger can give the resulting black hole a “kick,”</a> sending it flying away at high speed (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Alternatively, the black hole could have been spat out of a smashup among three galaxies. When a third galaxy joins an ongoing merger, three supermassive black holes jockey for position. One black hole can be tossed out of the galactic smashup, while the other two take off more slowly in the other direction.</p>



<p>That’s what van Dokkum thinks happened in this case. There are signs of a shorter, dimmer streak heading in the opposite direction from the bright, straight line.</p>



<p>More observations of this system, perhaps with the James Webb Space Telescope, are needed to confirm that it really is an ejected supermassive black hole, Angus says. More theoretical calculations of what a runaway supermassive black hole should look like would help too.</p>



<p>The finding motivates Angus to search through archived data for more potential black hole streaks. “I wonder if there are more of these features out there, sitting in someone’s data that might have just been missed,” she says.</p>



<p>Van Dokkum does too. “Now that we know what to look for, these very thin streaks, it makes sense to go back to Hubble data. We have 25 years of Hubble images that have not been searched with this purpose,” he says. “If there are more to be found, I think we can do it.”</p>

<p>Hindawi, the open access publisher that Wiley acquired in 2021, temporarily suspended publishing special issues because of “compromised articles,” according to a <a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Wiley-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2023-Results/default.aspx">press release</a> announcing the company’s third quarter financial results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brian Napack, Wiley’s president and CEO, specifically noted the “unplanned publishing pause at Hindawi” as a factor that “challenged” the company this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pause began in mid-October and ended in mid-January, a Wiley spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Wiley’s third quarter that ended Jan. 31, 2023, the suspension cost Hindawi – whose business model is based on charging authors to publish – $9 million in lost revenue compared to the third quarter of 2022. The company cited the pause as the primary reason its revenue from its research segment “was down 4% as reported, or down 2% at constant currency and excluding acquisitions,” the press release stated.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126674"></span>



<p>At the time of this writing, Wiley’s stock was trading 16% lower than it opened in the morning, and reached a new low for the past year.</p>



<p>The announcement follows <a href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2022/10/what-is-going-on-in-hindawi-special.html">scrutiny from sleuths</a>, and the publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">retracting hundreds of papers</a> for manipulated peer review last September, after Hindawi’s research integrity team began investigating a single special issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/05/a-paper-used-capital-ts-instead-of-error-bars-but-wait-theres-more/">notorious paper</a> with capital Ts as error bars was also published in a special issue of a Hindawi journal before it was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">retracted in December</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">another episode</a> we reported on last month, a professor used the email account of a former student to conduct all the correspondence needed to edit special issues of two Hindawi journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nearly 300 articles in the two special issues were “mostly meaningless gobbledegook” that suggested they came from a paper mill, according to sleuth Dorothy Bishop, who recently published a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv">preprint</a> identifying signs of paper mill activity in Hindawi special issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our query about the timing of the pause, a Wiley spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley has taken significant measures to address research integrity challenges after identifying misconduct in the external peer review process in Hindawi’s special issues, which are topic-specific issues of our journals. We moved to pause publication of special issues, increase controls and specialist staffing on all articles in progress in special issues, and introduce AI-based screening tools into the process … To counteract integrity issues in the future, we have added additional checks on guest editors and special issues.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-insect-fruit-fly-detail-nerve-cell">Scientists have mapped an insect brain in greater detail than ever before</a></h4>

              
                <p>The wiring of one insect’s brain no longer contains much uncharted territory.</p>



<p>All of the nerve cells — and virtually every connection between them — in a larval fruit fly brain have now been mapped, researchers report in the March 10 <em>Science</em>. It’s the <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add9330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most complex whole brain wiring diagram</a> yet created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, just three organisms — a sea squirt and two types of worm — had their brain circuitry fully diagrammed to this resolution. But the brains of those creatures have only a few hundred neurons. The scientists who conducted the new study wanted to understand much more complicated brains.</p>





<p>Fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) share a wide range of behaviors with humans, including integrating sensory information and learning. Larvae perform nearly all the same actions as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-complete-look-yet-fruit-fly-brain-cells">adult flies</a> — except for some, like flying and mating — but have smaller brains, making data collection much faster (<em>SN: 7/19/18</em>).</p>



<p>The idea for this project came 12 years ago, says neuroscientist Marta Zlatic of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. At that time, she and her colleagues captured electron microscope images of the entire larval fruit fly brain. They then stitched those images together in a computer and manually traced each neuron to create a 3-D rendering of the cells. Finally, the team found the connections where information gets passed between the cells, and even determined the sending and receiving ends.</p>



<p>The researchers identified more than 3,000 neurons and about 550,000 connections, known as synapses.</p>

Spheres represent each nerve cell body and the elongated tails are branches that send and receive information.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neurons transmit information to one another in circuits. Exploring the neurons’ connectivity patterns — not just directly linked partners, but also the links of linked cells and so on — revealed 93 different types of neurons. The classes were consistent with preexisting groupings characterized by shape and function. And nearly 75 percent of the most well-connected neurons were tied to the brain’s learning center, indicating the importance of learning in animals.</p>



<p>The researchers hope that this work serves as a blueprint for fellow scientists studying brain circuitry. “Now we have a reference map,” Zlatic says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dry-farming-agriculture-climate-change">Dry farming could help agriculture in the western U.S. amid climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the parking lot behind a grocery store in Portland, Ore., last September, several hundred tomato aficionados gathered on a sunny, breezy day for Tomato Fest. While many attendees devoured slices of tomato quiche and admired garlands of tomatoes with curiously pointed ends, I beelined to a yellow-tented booth hosted by Oregon State University. Agricultural researcher Matt Davis was handing out samples of experimental tomatoes.</p>



<p>I took four small plastic bags, each labeled with a cryptic set of letters and numbers and containing a thick slice of a yellow tomato. Scanning a QR code with my phone led me to an online survey with questions about each tomato’s balance of acidity and sweetness, texture and overall flavor. As I chewed on the slice from the bag marked “d86,” I noted the firm, almost meaty texture. Lacking the wateriness of a typical supermarket tomato, it would hold up beautifully in a salad or on a burger, I thought. And most importantly, it was tasty.</p>

The practice saves on water and produces more flavorful fruits and vegetables, advocates say.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122493">K. Kornei</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I learned later that this tomato had been dry-farmed, a form of agriculture that doesn’t require irrigation. Dry farming has roots stretching back millennia. But in the western United States, the practice largely fell out of widespread use in the 20th century.</p>



<p>Today, however, farmers in the West are once again experimenting with dry farming as they grapple with water shortages, which are being exacerbated by rising temperatures and more frequent and intense droughts linked to climate change.</p>





<p>Finding a more sustainable way to grow food in a thirsty state like California, for example, <a href="https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Water-Use-And-Efficiency/Agricultural-Water-Use-Efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where agriculture accounts for roughly 80 percent of water usage</a> and where a third of U.S. vegetables are grown, is a top priority. Dry farming won’t solve all of agriculture’s woes, but it offers a way forward, particularly for smaller-scale producers, while drawing less on a scarce natural resource. And even though the practice isn’t without limitations — dry-farmed produce tends to be physically smaller, and harvests are less bountiful overall — its benefits extend beyond water savings: Dry farming can also yield longer-lasting and better-tasting produce.</p>



<h4>How does dry farming work?</h4>



<p>It’s a common misconception that dry farming means growing plants without water. “Nothing grows without water,” says Amy Garrett, president of the nonprofit <a href="https://dryfarming.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dry Farming Institute</a> in Corvallis, Ore. Instead, dry-farmed plants take up moisture stored in the ground rather than sprinkled from above.</p>



<p>Dry farming is possible in states throughout the West. What’s needed is a wet rainy season, when rainwater infiltrates the soil, followed by a dry growing season, when plant roots pull in that moisture as needed. A wide variety of fruits and vegetables — including tomatoes, potatoes, squash, corn and even watermelons — can be dry-farmed. Dry farming is distinct from rain-fed agriculture, when crops grow during a wet season without the aid of irrigation.</p>





<p>For dry farming to work, a couple elements are essential. “You need to be in a place where there’s sufficient rainfall to create moisture in the soil,” says David Runsten, water policy director at the Community Alliance with Family Farmers in Davis, Calif. Sites must generally receive more than 50 centimeters of annual precipitation — in 2022, that was true in 26 of California’s 58 counties, for example — and the soil must be composed of fine grains that help retain that water over time.</p>



<p>Beyond that, farmers employ a range of techniques to help crops get all the moisture they need. Those methods include planting earlier in the season than usual to take advantage of soil moisture stored up from winter rains and spacing plants more widely to give roots more room to search for water. Farmers can also plant young seedlings in furrows to minimize the drying effects of the wind and lay down an insulating layer of mulch — often leaves, wood chips or straw — on top of the soil.</p>



<p>Dry farming is standard practice in many places around the world, from olive groves in the Mediterranean to melon fields in Botswana to vineyards in Chile. In the American West, dry farming has a long history stretching back thousands of years among Indigenous peoples.</p>



<p>“Dry farming is just farming — it’s our way of life,” says Michael Kotutwa Johnson, an Indigenous resiliency specialist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He’s also a member of the Hopi Tribe and dry-farms corn, lima beans and other crops. He learned the practice from his grandfather.</p>



<p>The intimate knowledge of the natural world that dry farming requires aligns with the Hopi community’s values and spiritual beliefs, he says. “You get to really learn what the environment gives you, and you learn to reciprocate.” A relationship develops between the cropping system and the farmer, he says. “It’s a beautiful thing, and it’s something that needs to be cherished.”</p>

Dry farming requires that crops be spaced farther apart than on an irrigated farm so that the plants have enough room to access all of the soil moisture they need.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122484">M.K. Johnson</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As non-Indigenous people started arriving in the West, they too began to dry-farm. But by the 20th century, many commercial farmers started relying on irrigation to capture growing markets. Having water on demand gave farmers more control and allowed them to boost production, says Jay Lund, vice director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis. “They could have a lot more reliable crop yields, and much higher crop yields.”</p>



<p>But today, irrigation water in many parts of the West is in short supply. In places like California’s San Joaquin Valley — the state’s largest agricultural region — water is pumped up from deep aquifers and often transported through canals and pipes before being deposited on crops. Researchers estimate that more than a quarter of irrigation water can be lost during transport due to evaporation and leaks. An even bigger problem in this region is that water is being <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/exploring-the-potential-for-water-limited-agriculture-in-the-san-joaquin-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extracted from the ground at a faster rate than it’s being replenished</a>. “There just isn’t sufficient water for the amount of farmland that’s been planted,” Runsten says.</p>



<p>And access to irrigation is already being curtailed. Farmers in California and other states in the West are experiencing water shortages and have at times been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">entirely cut off from irrigation</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<p>That’s not likely to change in the future, Runsten says. To meet the goals of California’s 2014 <a href="https://water.ca.gov/programs/groundwater-management/sgma-groundwater-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Groundwater Management Act</a>, for instance, more than 200,000 hectares of irrigated farmland in the San Joaquin Valley — roughly 10 percent — will need to be taken out of irrigated production by 2040. Dry-farming speciality crops like agave or jujube, an Asian fruit similar to a date, could be an economically attractive alternative for the land, according to a 2022 report by the nonprofit Public Policy Institute of California.</p>



<h4>Dry farming has pros and cons</h4>



<p>Catherine Nguyen, who farms on a little less than half a hectare of leased land outside of Portland, Ore., in the Willamette Valley, has been dry-farming for two years. Nguyen — whose customers include farmers market shoppers, members of her community supported agriculture, or CSA, program and small restaurants — was drawn to the practice in part out of curiosity. “I love experimentation and with the changing climate and cost of water, it seemed like something to learn more about,” she says. A portion of her property also lacks access to irrigation, so dry farming made it possible to use land that would otherwise remain fallow.</p>



<p>Potatoes were the first crop Nguyen dry-farmed. Beyond saving roughly 7,500 liters of water, Nguyen and her small crew discovered other benefits. There was no need for sprinklers, drip tape, hosing or any other irrigation equipment. That meant Nguyen’s farm could cut down on a lot of plastic equipment intended to last for just one or two growing seasons. “Not only is our water usage down, but so is our plastic usage,” Nguyen says. That lighter environmental touch is important to Nguyen, who uses farming methods that promote healthy soil ecosystems, including minimal tillage and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-erosion-rate-us-midwest-unsustainable-usda">cover cropping</a>, which involves growing plants specifically to improve the soil rather than for a harvest (<em>SN Online: 4/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>Last year, Nguyen dry-farmed delicata squash, corn, tomatoes, potatoes and beans. Nguyen noticed that her dry-farmed plots contained only about a fifth of the weeds that grow in her irrigated plots. That’s another known advantage of dry farming, Garrett says. Irrigation creates conditions for weed growth: Dispensing water through above­ground sprinklers causes moisture to pool near the surface, precisely where weeds wait for water, she says. “There is a weed seed bank in the top few inches of soil.”</p>



<p>Not having to pull up as many weeds or apply herbicides can translate into labor savings. Coupled with not having to manage irrigation infrastructure, dry farming can streamline a growing operation, Garrett says. “There’s a lot less to do.” <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/december/u-s-fruit-and-vegetable-industries-try-to-cope-with-rising-labor-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labor accounts for more than a quarter of total production costs</a> for U.S. fruit and vegetable farmers.</p>



<p>Another benefit is that the produce contains less water and therefore tends to store better. In 2016 and 2017, Alex Stone, a horticulturist at Oregon State University, and her student Jennifer Wetzel grew different varieties of winter squash at the university’s research farm in Corvallis. The pair irrigated some vegetable plots and dry-farmed others. After harvesting the squash and leaving them in storage for four months, Stone and Wetzel found that about 1,000 of the roughly 1,250 dry-farmed winter squash, or <a href="https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/1j92gd35b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 80 percent, were still marketable</a>. But only about 600 of the roughly 1,150 irrigated winter squash, or about 50 percent, were marketable.</p>

<h4>In search of water</h4>



<p>Dry-farmed tomatoes grow longer roots (plant on the left in the photograph) than irrigated tomatoes (plant on the right). Dry-farmed tomatoes are planted early in spring so they can access water in the topsoil (darker brown in the diagram). A lack of irrigation in summer encourages the roots to go searching for water as the soil dries out. By fall, the roots can be more than a meter deep.</p>

<p>Longer-lasting produce is a boon for small-scale fruit and vegetable growers, Garrett says. Winter is often a slow time sales-wise because there’s not much ripening. Selling stored crops in winter is one way that these farmers can earn an income during that lull. “If winter squash is storing months longer, that makes a huge impact for our local growers,” she says. Produce that lasts longer also means less food waste, both in farmers’ storage bins and in shoppers’ refrigerators and pantries.</p>



<p>Dry farming does have its downsides, however. The practice tends to produce smaller fruits and vegetables. That’s a natural outcome of withholding irrigation, Lund says. “The plant has less water to feed the growth of the fruit.” And growers, to say nothing of shoppers, can be wary of diminutively sized produce. That’s true among farmers in Oregon, Stone says. “They want a big, red tomato.”</p>



<p>Overall yields also tend to be lower. Not only does a dry-farmed plant produce fewer fruits or vegetables, but it also needs more space than its irrigated brethren so that its root system can spread out in search of water. Dry-farmed tomatoes, for instance, are typically planted almost two meters apart in rows separated by about two meters. Irrigated tomatoes can grow much closer together, about 60 centimeters apart, with rows separated by a meter or so.</p>



<p>Stone and Wetzel found that yields of irrigated winter squash at Oregon State’s research farm averaged 35.7 metric tons per hectare in 2016 and 32.2 metric tons in 2017. Dry-farmed squash yields were only 37 to 76 percent as much.</p>



<p>Diminished harvests can be a challenge. “With land access already being one of the biggest obstacles to farming, sometimes it’s hard for me to justify dry farming,” Nguyen says. Last year, she dry-farmed on only about a tenth of her property. “I do have to consider yield per square foot when deciding how much land to dry-farm,” she says.</p>



<p>Smaller harvests can translate to more expensive produce. “You don’t have the economies of scale,” Lund says. “Your costs are much higher per unit of production.” Dry-farmed tomatoes, for instance, typically sell for $4–$6 per pound and are primarily found at farmers markets and specialty grocery stores. That’s compared with $2–$3 per pound for traditional supermarket tomatoes grown with irrigation.</p>



<p>Dry-farmed produce may never become truly mainstream, Johnson says. “I don’t see us moving in that direction as long as we still have a market system that’s based on efficiency and quantity.” But many dry farming experts argue that paying more for dry-farmed produce is an investment in the future. And, they point out, dry-farmed produce tastes better.</p>

<h4>How does dry farming affect flavor?</h4>



<p>In California’s Napa Valley, there’s nary an irrigation hose snaking through Dominus Estate’s roughly 55-hectare Napanook Vineyard. Every last one of the more than 100,000 cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and petit verdot grapevines planted there is dry-farmed.</p>



<p>The water savings are tremendous, says Tod Mostero, Dominus Estate’s director of viticulture and winemaking. A single irrigated grapevine is typically irrigated with nearly 40 liters of water several times or more over the growing season, he says. For a vineyard the size of Napanook, that translates to nearly 4 million liters, or about a million gallons, for just one watering, Mostero says. In drought-prone California, that’s not sustainable, he says. “Pumping millions of gallons of water out of the soil is not something that we can continue to do.”</p>



<p>Beyond the water savings, there’s another reason Napanook Vineyard is dry-farmed, Mostero says. The practice produces the best wines, he contends. When grapevines are dry-farmed, the unique flavors of a wine associated with a place, and even a vintage, often shine through. Grapevines can send roots up to six meters deep in search of moisture. As those roots pass through layers of soil and rock, they absorb a complex set of minerals unique to that location, Mostero says. “You really find the terroir, the subtle differences between different areas.” For that very reason, some wine-growing regions, in parts of Europe for example, forbid vineyards from irrigating wine grapes.</p>



<p>Oenophiles aren’t the only ones swearing by the superior flavors of dry-farmed fruits and vegetables. Laurence Jossel, the chef-owner of Nopa, a restaurant in San Francisco that specializes in wood-fired cuisine, sources dry-farmed tomatoes from local farms. Tomatoes that are bloated with water taste “boring,” Jossel maintains. “The acid is gone, and the sweetness is gone.” He uses dry-farmed tomatoes in everything from soups to flatbreads. Sometimes they’re the star ingredient: A salad of chopped tomatoes topped with a bit of feta or mozzarella is one of Nopa’s summer offerings. “The tomato itself is just amazing,” he says.</p>



<h4>What’s the future of dry farming?</h4>



<p>Despite the environmental benefits of dry farming, some farmers remain wary. Stone has found that growers in Oregon are often cautious about the practice, even when it comes to cultivating varieties that sell well elsewhere. A case in point is Early Girl tomatoes, which are extensively dry-farmed in California and available at both California supermarkets and farmers markets.</p>



<p>“They just see them as elite, expensive, small tomatoes,” Stone says.</p>



<p>To explore the economic viability of dry farming, Stone is leading farming trials of dry-farmed crops to determine which varieties are most suited to commercial production. In recent years, she and colleagues have focused on tomatoes, which, after potatoes, are the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most commonly consumed vegetable in the United States</a>. (Technically a fruit, tomatoes are considered a vegetable for nutritional and culinary purposes by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.)</p>



<p>Stone’s team at Oregon State has grown hundreds of types of tomatoes. By recording yields, susceptibility to <a href="https://www.almanac.com/pest/blossom-end-rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common diseases like blossom-end rot</a>, and the size, firmness and flavor of the tomatoes, the researchers have started to home in on varieties that thrive — and taste good — when the irrigation is turned off. The first yellow tomato I sampled at Tomato Fest is one of the researchers’ leading contenders.</p>

<p>Dry farming offers one way forward as water resources become more unpredictable in the future. But it’s not a one-size-fits-all panacea for climate change, researchers admit. In some cases, crops that once thrived without irrigation may no longer do well at some point in the future.</p>



<p>“As summers become hotter and drier, crops will require even more water as they will lose more water [through evapotranspiration], making dry farming riskier,” Stone says.</p>



<p>Some farmers may have to swap one type of crop for another that’s more suited to even drier conditions. Fruit trees with particularly long, deep roots are good bets, Garrett says, as are species like melons that originally evolved in arid locales.</p>



<p>Whatever the future holds, being adaptable will be key. Farmers must be prepared to respond to changing conditions, Johnson says, but must also allow nature to lead. After all, that’s worked for his community for thousands of years.</p>



<p>“We raise corn to fit the environment,” he says. “We do not manipulate the environment to fit the corn.”</p>

<p>In March 2020, a group of biologists published a paper on the website of an open access journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly three years later, the publisher, Wiley, withdrew the article because, according to the withdrawal notice, the authors were “unable to finalize” payment of the fee to publish the version of record, known as the Article Publication Charge or APC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The manuscript, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12950">Eco-evolutionary factors that influence its demographic oscillations in <em>Prochilodus costatus</em> (Actinopterygii: Characiformes) populations evidenced through a genetic spatial–temporal evaluation</a>,” had appeared on the site of the journal <em>Evolutionary Applications </em>“as an Accepted Article,” according to the notice, but the full text is no longer available online. It had not been indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science before being withdrawn on February 27.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice stated that the article&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126667"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>has been withdrawn by agreement between the authors, journal Editor-in-Chief Louis Bernatchez and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. The withdrawal has been agreed because the authors are unable to finalize the APC payment for their article for publication in the journal as the Version of Record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we wrote to Bernatchez with questions about the notice, he referred us to a Wiley staffer. A spokesperson for the publisher told us that the statement was “incorrect,” and “we will be working with the author to resolve and potentially republish the article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked what exactly was wrong with the withdrawal note, and a spokesperson replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The withdrawal statement incorrectly lists the authors as agreeing to the withdrawal, when in fact they were only informed of this action. We are now working with the authors to resubmit the article to the journal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spokesperson also said that the final version of the article “was not published in alignment with our <a href="https://authorservices.wiley.com/open-research/open-access/for-authors/publication-charges.html">Open Access Publication Charges</a> policy.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-ozone-layer-chemical-reaction-smoke">How wildfires deplete the Earth’s ozone layer</a></h4>

              
                <p>Towering clouds of smoke sent into the stratosphere by ferocious wildfires can eat away at Earth’s ozone layer thanks to a potent mix of smoke, atmospheric chemistry and ultraviolet light, a new study finds.</p>



<p>During late 2019 and early 2020, Australia’s skies turned black, darkened by thick columns of wildfire smoke that reached into the stratosphere. In the aftermath, satellite data revealed that the smoke was somehow reacting with atmospheric molecules <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smoke-australia-fires-ozone-layer-damage-chemistry-climate">to eat away at Earth’s ozone layer</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/22</em>). But how exactly that was happening wasn’t clear.</p>





<p>Now, scientists have put together <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05683-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pieces of that chemical puzzle</a>. Once in the stratosphere, the team says, the smoke particles were able to interact with stratospheric gases as well as lingering emissions of ozone-destroying chemicals. Add in solar radiation, and that smoky brew churned out chlorine radicals, a type of chemical with an affinity for attacking ozone, researchers report in the March 9 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>This series of events was responsible for depleting about 3 to 5 percent of the ozone layer in parts of the Southern Hemisphere during 2020, the researchers estimate. That’s a small fraction of the whole — but it rivals the scale of the impact of human emissions of ozone-eating chlorofluorocarbons in their heyday, says MIT atmospheric chemist Susan Solomon.</p>



<p>Chlorofluorocarbons were once used in air conditioners and refrigerators, but their emission to the atmosphere led to a large hole over Antarctica in Earth’s protective ozone layer, which limits how much of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation reaches the planet’s surface.</p>



<p>In the new study, Solomon and her colleagues compared atmospheric observations of chlorine, ozone and other molecules following the Australian wildfires with simulations of atmospheric chemistry. Satellites had measured the abundance of certain chemicals in the stratosphere in 2020 — not just ozone, but also hydrogen chloride gas and chlorine nitrate, among others. Those levels caught Solomon’s attention.</p>



<p>“What we saw over Australia was a tremendous drop in hydrogen chloride” in the satellite data, Solomon says. “I thought, gosh, this looks just like Antarctica. How can this be happening over Australia?”</p>



<p>Hydrogen chloride gas is a product of the breakdown of chlorofluorocarbons, which can linger for decades in the stratosphere. The frigid environment over Antarctica was a key part of the ozone hole’s formation, because at those temperatures hydrogen chloride gas can dissolve into the icy clouds traveling through the stratosphere. The absorption of that gas is essential to starting the chain of reactions that form ozone-depleting chemicals.</p>



<p>The atmosphere over Australia is too warm for this process — but the satellite data indicated that something was still removing hydrogen chloride gas from the atmosphere. Solomon and her team realized that the culprit was the organic particles in the smoke. Those particles can absorb hydrogen chloride gas even at warmer temperatures, kicking off that essential first step.</p>





<p>With the absorbed hydrogen chloride, the smoke particles can act as catalysts, helping to speed along other reactions in the atmosphere. In particular, the particles amp up the transformation of other chlorine-containing gases floating in the stratosphere, such as chlorine nitrate and hypochlorous acid, into chlorine compounds that are highly reactive to sunlight.</p>



<p>Mixing the sun’s ultraviolet radiation with those new chlorine compounds produces chlorine radicals, freewheeling molecules that are extremely chemically reactive — and especially enjoy attacking ozone molecules.</p>



<p>The discovery of this wildfire-related process for destroying ozone is a worrisome potential setback to the recovery of the ozone layer, Solomon says. The 1987 Montreal Protocol targeted the use of chlorofluorocarbons, which were phased out by 2010, an act that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drop-cfc-emissions-hole-ozone-layer-back-on-track-closing">has been encouragingly successful</a> at shrinking the hole in the ozone over Antarctica (<em>SN: 2/10/21</em>). The ozone layer has shown signs of recovery ever since, growing back on the order of 1 percent per decade, she says.</p>



<p>However, the smoke from the Australian wildfires more or less “wiped out all that hard work” for the year, Solomon adds. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of wildfires around the globe, sending <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/willdfire-thunder-pyro-clouds-aerosols-volcanic-eruptions">more towering fire clouds</a> high into the sky (<em>SN: 12/15/20</em>). If these fires “are a one-time deal, it’s maybe not so bad” for ozone recovery, Solomon says. “But if it happens every five years, that’s a different kettle of fish.”</p>



<p>The study elegantly explains several puzzling satellite observations made in the wake of the Australian fires, says Ross Salawitch, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the work. It elucidates the drop in hydrogen chloride, he says, as well as strange increases in other chlorine compounds like chlorine nitrate and chlorine oxide. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the “icing on the cake,” Salawitch says, is how the discovery of the role of organic particles can improve our understanding of what controls the size of the ozone hole. This is important, not just because we want to get the details right, he says, but because “one of the unfortunate consequences of global warming is likely an increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/520-million-year-old-animal-fossils">520-million-year-old animal fossils might not be animals after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>A species that lived about 520 million years ago and was thought to be the oldest known bryozoan is instead a type of colony-forming algae, a new study proposes.</p>



<p>Bryozoans are filter-feeding, tentacle-bearing animals that live in apartment complex–like colonies attached to rocks, shells or other surfaces on seafloors or lake bottoms. Trouble is, some other animals and algae inhabit the same sort of modular construction. While <em>Protomelission gatehousei </em>was first described in 1993, scientists didn’t categorize it as a bryozoan until 2021.</p>





<p>Now, analyses of fossils even better preserved than those described previously show that the species may not have been a bryozoan after all, says Martin Smith, a paleobiologist at Durham University in England.</p>



<p>Where previous fossils preserved only the skeletal framework of colonies, the new fossils, unearthed in southern China, include soft parts of the organism too, Smith says. And instead of the tentacles expected to have been found in an immaculately preserved bryozoan, the fossils have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05775-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple leaflike flanges typical of some types of algae</a>, he and colleagues report March 8 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>

<p>If borne out, the new find means that the oldest unequivocal bryozoan fossils that are known are only about 480 million years old. That, Smith contends, makes bryozoans the only major group of animals not to have first appeared during the Cambrian Period, a burst of biological diversification that some scientists have referred to as “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites">life’s Big Bang</a>” and which ended about 488 million years ago (<em>SN: 4/24/19</em>).</p>



<p>As a result, the Cambrian was not, as previously thought, a unique interval of innovation in evolutionary history during which all the blueprints of animal life were mapped out, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>“The question is, did evolution lose its ability to create new body plans?” Smith says. The team’s new find suggests not, he says.</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees that the new fossils aren’t bryozoans. The leaflike flanges described by Smith and his colleagues could just as easily be interpreted as body parts of individual animals in the bryozoan colony, says Paul Taylor, an invertebrate paleontologist at London’s Natural History Museum who wasn’t involved in the study.</p>





<p>Because the tentacles that bryozoans use to snatch prey from the water are soft tissue and typically don’t preserve well, their absence from the new fossils is not at all surprising, Taylor notes.</p>



<p>For Taylor, the new findings aren’t sufficient to dismiss <em>P. gatehousei </em>as a Cambrian bryozoan, but they do underline the inherent uncertainty in identifying fossils with simple body plans. More fossils preserving additional features, such as those that preserve the organism’s early growth stages, are needed to settle the question, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/the-open-science-atlas/">The Open Science Atlas</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a> with applications and nominations for this year&rsquo;s awards open until <strong>April 30th, 2023</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>. &nbsp;The Einstein Foundation Awards program honors researchers who&nbsp;reflect&nbsp;<strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong>&nbsp;in their work. To get a flavor of what the Einstein Foundation is looking for we have asked last year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their work (watch this space for other finalists in the coming weeks). First up are four researchers (bios and photos at the end of the blog) who are introducing a platform to monitor transparent research practices across scientific disciplines . You can watch a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTa14j3nS_o&amp;t=48s">here</a> and/or read more below.</p>



<h1><a></a><a></a>What?</h1>



<p>The Open Science Atlas<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> will be a web-platform that enables continuous, large-scale monitoring of transparent research practices across the scientific ecosystem. The platform will be driven by a unique data extraction engine that combines global crowdsourcing and automated algorithms to produce living maps of the research transparency landscape. These maps can be explored at various levels of detail, from high-level scientific disciplines, down to individual institutions or journals, and will evolve over time to reveal temporal trends.</p>



<p>This bird&rsquo;s eye view of the transparency landscape will provide an empirical measure of progress, helping us to avoid becoming unduly despondent (because we think nothing is improving) or complacent (because we think everything is fine). The Open Science Atlas will also support further meta-research on the implementation of transparent research practices; for example, whether preregistrations are being properly reported [1] and whether shared data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) [2,3]. In certain situations, the data we gather may support causal inferences about the effectiveness of specific interventions (e.g., journal policy) intended to promote transparency [4]. The results will be available to all on a public data dashboard, motivating and informing community efforts to improve research transparency [5].</p>



<h1><a></a>Why?</h1>



<p>Transparency is a fundamental principle of scientific methodology that is widely neglected in practice. Our research has found that scientists in psychology [6] rarely share data (2%), analysis scripts (1%), or research materials (14%), seldom use preregistration (3%), and only occasionally disclose funding sources (62%) or conflicts of interest (39%) (the situation is similar in the social sciences [7] and biomedicine [8]).</p>



<p>Although many initiatives have been introduced to try and increase adoption of rigorous and transparent research practices [9], there is usually no plan in place to monitor progress. This limits our ability to gauge effectiveness, detect unintended side effects, and identify areas in need of additional attention or support. Monitoring research transparency will facilitate a virtuous cycle in which policy initiatives are strategically designed and refined in response to empirical data, maximizing their benefit [5].</p>



<h1><a></a>How?</h1>



<p>Previous efforts to monitor transparent research practices [6,7] have been limited in scope by the amount of manual labour required to extract information from scientific articles. Text-mining algorithms have shown promise at automating this process [8], but algorithms still require validation against a manually extracted gold standard (i.e., human judgment). Validation also needs to be an ongoing exercise, as reporting of transparency research practices varies across contexts (disciplines, journals, etc.) and will shift over time. The Open Science Atlas will address this problem through its unique data extraction engine that combines (1) automated algorithms and (2) global crowdsourcing.</p>



<p>Our algorithm approach will be based on the prior work of our team member Dr Serghiou, who led the development and validation of text-mining algorithms to measure transparency indicators across 2.75 million open access biomedical articles [8]. We plan to use algorithms because they are functional, not because they are flashy, and we will always be clear about their capabilities and limitations. Whenever the Open Science Atlas uses algorithms, the relevant validation and accuracy statistics will be prominently displayed so users can calibrate their confidence in our results. Moreover, our algorithms will always be open source, so they can be verified and reused by others.</p>



<p>Our crowdsourcing approach will be based on a project led by our team member Dr Mody known as &lsquo;repliCATS&rsquo; [10], and similar projects, like Cochrane Crowd. These projects have demonstrated the feasibility of building large volunteer communities willing to collaborate on meta-scientific projects. For example, repliCATS successfully generated credibility judgements for 4000 social science articles from over 1000 researchers located in over 30 countries.</p>



<p>Contributors to the Open Science Atlas will receive training from our core team, be eligible for various prizes, and be acknowledged for their work on any relevant scientific publications. We will build a semi-automated workflow for article selection, quality control, and data management, which will enable volunteers to contribute to the Atlas whenever it is convenient for them. We will also arrange virtual and in-person hackathons around the world so folks can work alongside each other and get to know each other &mdash; data extraction is much more fun over a shared pizza.</p>



<h1><a></a>What&rsquo;s next?</h1>



<p>We&rsquo;re super excited about the Open Science Atlas, but alas, we did not win the Einstein Award<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. So we are currently seeking funding to help us make our vision a reality. We&rsquo;re also keen to hear from folks who have expertise developing and validating algorithms in scientific contexts who might be interested in working with us. And if you&rsquo;re excited about joining our global community of contributors, let us know and we&rsquo;ll get in touch when we&rsquo;re up and running. You can drop us a line at <a href="mailto:open.sci.atlas@gmail.com">open.sci.atlas@gmail.com</a> and follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenSciAtlas">@OpenSciAtlas</a>) or Mastodon <a href="https://mas.to/@OpenSciAtlas">@OpenSciAtlas@mas.to</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-stars-galaxies-james-webb-space-images">Newborn stars sculpt their galaxies in new James Webb telescope images</a></h4>

              
                <p>A gaggle of galaxies crackle with intricate detail in new images from the James Webb Space Telescope. JWST’s sharp infrared eyes are revealing how newborn stars shape their surroundings, giving hints to how stars and galaxies grow up together.</p>



<p>“We were just blown away,” says Janice Lee, an astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson. She and more than 100 astronomers reported on <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/collections/2041-8205_PHANGS-JWST-First-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists’ first look at these galaxies with JWST</a> in a special February issue of the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>





<p>Before JWST <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">launched in December 2021</a>, Lee and her colleagues selected 19 galaxies that, if observed with the telescope, they thought could reveal new details of the life cycles of stars (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>). These galaxies are relatively close, within 65 million light-years of the Milky Way, and all have different types of spiral structures. The team had observed the galaxies with many observatories, but parts of the galaxies had always looked flat and featureless.</p>



<p>“With [JWST], we’re seeing structure down to the very smallest scales,” Lee says. &#8220;For the first time, we’re seeing the youngest sites of star formation in a lot of these galaxies.”</p>

NGC 1365 (shown) has a bright bar in its core that connects its spiral arms. JWST detected glowing dust in this galaxy’s center that had been obscured in previous observations.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122369">Science: NASA, ESA, CSA, Janice Lee/NOIRLab; Image processing: Alyssa Pagan/STScI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the new images, the galaxies’ faces are pockmarked by dark voids amid glowing filaments of gas and dust. Comparisons to Hubble Space Telescope images reveal that these voids are bubbles carved out of the gas and dust by high-energy radiation from newborn stars in their centers.</p>



<p>Then, when the most massive of those stars reach the end of their life and explode, that gas gets pushed out even more. Some of the larger bubbles have smaller bubbles on their edges, which could indicate spots where the gas pushed by dying stars has started to build new stars.</p>



<p>Comparing these processes in different types of spiral galaxies will help astronomers understand how the galaxies’ shapes and properties influence the life cycles of their stars, and how the galaxies grow and change with their stellar denizens.</p>



<p>“We’ve only studied the first few [of the 19 selected] galaxies,” Lee says. “We need to study these things in the full sample to understand how the environment changes … how stars are born.”</p>

<p>It was déjà vu last month when <a href="https://www.vub.be/nl/nieuws/vub-trekt-doctoraatstitel-in-van-abu-hatem-hashim">a university in Belgium stripped</a> Egyptian physician Hatem Abu Hashim of his doctorate after he was found to have fabricated data in his thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just weeks earlier, another Egyptian doctor, Ahmed Badawy, <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/news/utrecht-university-withdraws-doctoral-degree-granted-in-2008">lost the PhD</a> degree he had earned at a Dutch university in 2008. Abu Hashim and Badawy are both <a href="https://medfac.mans.edu.eg/index.php/en/staff-obs-en">professors in the department of obstetrics and gynecology</a> at Mansoura University in Egypt.</p>



<p>According to an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/VCWI_SecondAdvice_2022-01.pdf">investigation</a> by the Vrije Universeit Brussel (VUB), which awarded Abu Hashim his PhD in 2013, the researcher was in &#8220;serious violation of scientific integrity&#8221; based on &#8220;overwhelming evidence of fabrication of statistical outcomes&#8221; and &#8220;clear lack of statistical proficiency.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126655"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ben Mol of Monash University in Australia, a researcher turned <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">data sleuth</a> who alerted VUB and Utrecht University to problems with Abu Hashim and Badawy &#8216;s research in 2021 and 2020, respectively, told Retraction Watch by email, &#8220;The good news is obviously that there is a firm conclusion from both universities after a robust process independent of the complaint.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol also laid out <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">his concerns</a> in a <a href="https://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115%2820%2930184-6/fulltext">study</a> published with then-PhD student Esmée Bordewijk and others in 2020, as Retraction Watch reported that year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it could have been a bit faster, but on the other hand we have this conversation because they took the right decision,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Abu Hashim&#8217;s PhD thesis is based on 11 randomized controlled trials, all of which have been published. Ostensibly, the studies were done at Mansoura University before Abu Hashim enrolled as an external PhD candidate at VUB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/VCWI_SecondAdvice_2022-01.pdf">report from the Flemish Commission for Scientific Integrity</a>, which gave a second opinion on the VUB findings following a request from Abu Hashim, offers a &#8220;credible&#8221; scenario for how the 11 papers came about, suggesting:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>that Abu Hashim had learned to write medical papers by reading others, that he made up all reported values and that he wrote more papers by adapting previous papers, copying results between articles and applying small alterations (+1 or -1 in some digits).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The commission agreed with VUB that &#8220;complete (or virtually complete) fabrication is the only reasonable explanation for the findings.&#8221; It also noted that &#8220;strikingly,&#8221; the researcher did not address any of the allegations against him:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To the contrary, his defence consists mainly of accusing those bringing forward the complaint of misconduct and questioning their work and methods.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Abu Hashim nor Mansoura University responded to requests for comment.</p>



<p>The school, however, has known about Abu Hashim’s fraudulent research for a decade. In an internal investigation from 2014, then-head of department Nasser El Lakany and five other professors found that <a href="https://www.ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2013.24.2.128">one of the researcher’s </a>trials had never been done; six trials included an impossibly large number of women with polycystic ovary syndrome; and two reported 366 ovarian-drilling procedures while records were found to exist only for 94. The latter two groups of studies formed part of Abu Hashim’s PhD thesis.</p>



<p>“There is no excuse for the researcher’ [sic] misconduct (fabricating imaginary data and studies not done at all, or studies with doubtful cases not in records),” the Mansoura professors write, according to an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/English-report-on-Dr-AbuHashim-research.pdf">English translation</a> of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mansoura-investigation-of-Abu-Hashim_Arabic.pdf">original Arabic report</a>.   </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2021, sleuth Nick Brown also began <a href="https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2021/10/a-catastrophic-failure-of-peer-review.html">poring over</a> the Egyptian researchers&#8217; work after a Dutch journalist requested his opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t read papers. They read the abstract. They say, congratulations, great paper. And then they go back to what they were doing the rest of their day because reading a paper is quite hard,&#8221; Brown told Retraction Watch. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very good at statistics, but I can read a table and things jump out at me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brown quickly realized that Badawy and Abu Hashim&#8217;s publications were littered with &#8220;fatal flaws.&#8221; Virtually all of the <em>P</em>-values were wrong. In some cases, they exceeded 1 – a mathematical impossibility. In others, vastly different values were given for identical statistical tests that by definition should have yielded the same results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I assume the authors were just making up &#8216;likely-looking&#8217; numbers in a hurry and didn&#8217;t realise that these needed to be identical,&#8221; Brown said in an email. &#8220;We often find that people who cheat are not very good at knowing what genuine numbers should look like.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brown, who himself has an external PhD from a Dutch university, noted that institutions receive the same amount of money from the government whether a PhD candidate is external or internal:</p>



<p>&#8220;So someone comes along with some papers already done. They need to write a top and tail of a thesis. They&#8217;re probably not going to need a whole lot of supervision.&nbsp; Exactly how many questions do you ask?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A spokesperson for Utrecht University told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have asked ourselves the question how this could have happened. Why did the supervisor and the Doctoral Examination Committee not notice this? The articles that were the basis for the thesis, were published in peer reviewed journals. Only much later it came to light that the data underlying these articles had been compromised.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She added that the rules for external PhD candidates have been tightened since 2008, when Badawy obtained his degree (the changes are described <a href="https://www.uu.nl/nieuws/universiteit-utrecht-trekt-in-2008-verleende-doctorsgraad-in">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Jaspers, a VUB press officer, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is updating its PhD regulations. External PhD students working with existing datasets created at a university other than the VUB and publications reviewed by scientific journals will soon (this spring) be fully audited by the VUB.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, Mol, whose work on various cases recently <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research">featured in <em>The Economist</em></a>, worries about all the fake studies that have not yet been retracted, and the impact they might have on patient care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I cannot understand that &#8230; three years after our publication <a href="https://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115%2820%2930184-6/fulltext">of the Bordewijk study</a>, still half of the Badawy and Abu Hashim studies are out there even without an expression of concern,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What ideally should happen is that there should be a mechanism that all the journals and publishers bundle their investigation.&#8221;</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/fig-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Across sub-Saharan Africa, maternal and child health initiatives are embracing the use of electronic or mobile technology to improve access to and utilization of skilled obstetric care, especially among marginalized and vulnerable populations. These initiatives have been shown to be successful in increasing the use of health facilities by pregnant women, improving two-way communication between healthcare workers and pregnant women, and increasing women&#8217;s self-efficacy through the dissemination of pertinent health information.</p>
<p>The research team at the Women’s Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC) in Nigeria, led by Professor Friday Okonofua in collaboration with national and international partners and with funding from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the West African Health Organization, began formative, intervention, and implementation research in 2017 to identify innovations and evidence for improving women&#8217;s access to skilled pregnancy care in rural Primary Health Centers (PHCs). During the formative study, we identified transportation as a significant barrier for pregnant women to access existing PHCs.</p>
<p>Multiple qualitative studies with women, men, and community leaders revealed that women resorted to traditional methods of pregnancy care due to a lack of transportation to reach health facilities, especially when labor or complications began at night. This was one of the most important reasons that pregnant women preferred to use unskilled traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who are nearest to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Text4Life intervention was carried out for nearly 24 months, yielding impressive results with no documented maternal deaths.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to this challenge, the team designed a set of interventions to address this barrier, in collaboration with women, community leaders, and policymakers, using community-based participatory research techniques. Text4Life, a RapidSMS system, was developed to respond to the difficulty faced by women in reaching PHCs when they experience pregnancy complications.</p>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>Text4Life was designed to enable two-way communication between women, PHC providers, and transport owners. When a pregnant woman experiences complications such as bleeding, normal or abnormal labor, severe abdominal pain, etc. and she has no means of transportation, she activates an alert system by texting a code from her preregistered phone number to a central server that is linked to all Nigerian telecommunication networks. She initiates the alert herself, or she is assisted by someone else.</p>
<p>When the alert is activated, the Chairman of the Ward Development Committee (WDC) that had been established to register the pregnant women in the community where the woman resides receives the alert and identifies her location. The WDC is an initiative of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health to strengthen community ties and partnerships for the management of PHCs. At the same time, the provider at the closest to the PHC also receives the alert and starts preparations to receive the woman. The WDC chair will then contact one of the authorized and pre-registered transporters (taxi-owners) in the community, who would go to the woman’s home and drive her to the health center. Text4Life includes a reversed billing technique that sends a free alert message.</p>
<p>Text4Life operates on a continuous power source, with a central server connected to the internet and a website. The system includes a platform for registering new pregnancies as well as assistance in monitoring pregnancies throughout the antenatal, birth, and post-partum phases.</p>
<p>A number of capacity-building workshops were organized in the project sites for WDCs, PHC providers, pregnant women (and their spouses or caregivers), and female volunteers to develop capacity among community stakeholders to manage the system. The training included an explanation of the potential pregnancy complications for which women would require urgent transfer. They were also shown how to transmit messages and interpret responses from the central server.</p>
<blockquote><p>This intervention holds a strong promise for improving access to skilled pregnancy care, reducing delays due to lack of transportation, and decreasing the rate of maternal mortality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Health providers were instructed on ways to prepare to receive women as well as the specific actions to take in response to emergencies, such as primary treatment, triaging, and referrals to secondary care hospitals should the need arise. Following the completion of the training, mobile phones were given to PHC healthcare providers and the WDC chairmen. During antenatal care visits, the PHC providers also showed the women how to use the Text4Life app.</p>
<h4>Outcomes and other applications of Text4Life</h4>
<p>As reported in our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05424-9">new paper</a>, the Text4Life intervention was carried out for nearly 24 months, yielding impressive results with no documented maternal deaths in the rural communities. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) Nigeria office is presently utilizing the Text4Life approach to carry out an intervention in 320 communities across nine Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja for women to report cases of gender-based violence (GBV), COVID-19, family planning needs, and unwanted pregnancies.</p>
<p>Women experiencing GBV and other complications can text a code to a central server via their mobile phones. The messages are then relayed to trained nearby health providers and civic society officials, who are expected to provide health care and social management to the distressed callers. The findings show that over a 22-month period, the server received a total of 3,200 reports, with the data currently being analyzed to determine the outcomes of management.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The development of the Text4Life app shows the potential of a quick short message sent from a mobile phone to a central server and linked to community managers, transport providers, and health providers to increase pregnant women&#8217;s access to skilled emergency obstetric services in rural Nigeria. The findings suggest that the intervention is feasible and sustainable, particularly when implemented with the active involvement and ownership by community members. We believe that this intervention holds a strong promise for improving access to skilled pregnancy care, reducing delays due to lack of transportation, and decreasing the rate of maternal mortality in rural Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-room-temperature-scrutiny">Is this the superconductor of scientists’ dreams? A new claim faces scrutiny</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>LAS VEGAS</strong> — It&#8217;s a bold claim: The quest to create a superconductor that works under practical conditions is finally fulfilled, a team of researchers says. But controversy has dogged the team’s earlier claim of record-breaking superconductivity, and the new result is already facing extreme scrutiny.</p>



<p>The ultimate test will be whether the result can be confirmed by other researchers, says physicist Mikhail Eremets of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany. “I repeat it like [a] mantra: ‘Reproduce.’”</p>





<p>Many materials become superconductors, able to transmit electricity with no resistance, provided they’re cooled to very low temperatures. A few superconductors work under warmer conditions, but those must be squeezed to crushing pressures, so they’re impractical to use.</p>



<p>Now physicist Ranga Dias of the University of Rochester in New York and colleagues say they have <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/K20.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a superconductor that works at both room temperature and relatively low pressure</a>. A superconductor that operates under such commonplace conditions could herald a new age of high-efficiency machines, supersensitive instrumentation and revolutionary electronics.</p>



<p>“This is the start of the new type of material that’s useful for practical applications,”&nbsp;Dias said March 7 at the American Physical Society meeting, where he reported the feat.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05742-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superconductor is made of hydrogen mixed with nitrogen and a rare earth element called lutetium</a>, Dias and colleagues report March 8 in <em>Nature</em>. The team combined the elements and squeezed them in a device known as a diamond anvil cell. The researchers then varied the pressure and temperature and measured the resistance to electrical flow in the compound.</p>



<p>At temperatures as high as 294 kelvins (about 21° Celsius or 70° Fahrenheit), the material seemed to lose any electrical resistance. It still required pressures of 10 kilobar, which is about 10,000 times the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere. But that’s far lower than the millions of atmospheres of pressure typically required for superconductors that operate near room temperature. If confirmed, that makes the material much more promising for real-world applications.</p>



<p>The material displayed several hallmarks of a superconductor, the team reports<em>.</em> Not only did the electrical resistance suddenly drop as it became superconducting, but the material also expelled magnetic fields and exhibited an abrupt change in its heat capacity, Dias says.</p>



<p>When the researchers put the squeeze on the material in the diamond anvil cell, it suddenly turned from a bluish hue to hot pink. “I had never seen a color change like this in a material,” Dias says. “It was like, wow.” That color change indicated a shift in the electrical properties of the material as it became a superconductor, Dias says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="A new material changes color as it becomes a superconductor  | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1aon_Ufq-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Scientists claim to have found a superconductor that works at room temperature and relatively low pressure. If true, that might make it suitable for use in real-world devices. As scientists increase the pressure on the compound, made of hydrogen, lutetium and nitrogen, it changes from blue to pink. This signifies the material changing to a superconductor, in which electricity flows without resistance. Further increasing the pressure causes it to change to red, as it loses its superconducting properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This superconductor might be able to escape the confines of a diamond anvil cell, Dias says, opening it up to practical applications. A technique called strain engineering, for example, could mimic the required pressure. In such a process, researchers grow a material on a surface that constrains growth, putting a strain on the material that replicates the effects of externally applied squeezing.</p>





<p>Still, the research faces significant skepticism, in part because of the firestorm over the team’s earlier publication that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">claimed the discovery of superconductivity</a> in a compound of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen at 15° C (<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>). Editors at <em>Nature</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/room-temperature-superconductor-retraction-physics">retracted that paper</a>, over the objection of Dias and his coauthors, citing irregularities in the researchers’ data handling that undermined the editors’ confidence in the claims (<em>SN: 10/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>Several experts have expressed a lack of confidence in the new results presented by Dias’ group, based on that history. Not only was the previous result retracted, but other researchers were unable to reproduce it, says Eremets, including his own group at the Max Planck Institute. “The main test of validity — reproducibility — was failed, and from my point of view that’s the most important thing.”</p>



<p>The stakes are high. “If it’s true, it’s a great discovery,” says physicist Eugene Gregoryanz of the University of Edinburgh. But he views the researchers with suspicion. “Whether it’s true or not, I guess time will show.”</p>



<p>Others are more positive. “It’s an excellent study,” says materials chemist Russell Hemley of the University of Illinois Chicago. “The data as presented, in terms of evidence for superconductivity, is very strong.” Hemley was not involved with the study but has collaborated with Dias in the past, including on a follow-up to the retracted superconductor paper. Submitted February 16 at arXiv.org, that paper, which has not yet passed peer-review, reports that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the previously claimed superconductor does function</a> near room temperature.</p>



<p>The new superconductor is a hydrogen-rich type known as a hydride. Scientists predict that pure hydrogen should be a room-temperature superconductor, but only at extremely high pressures that make it difficult to produce. To lower the pressure, scientists have added in other elements, making hydride superconductors.</p>



<p>In 2015, Eremets and colleagues produced a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-big-stride-superconductivity">compound of sulfur and hydrogen</a> that was superconducting up to −70° C, a record high temperature at the time (<em>SN: 12/15/15</em>). A few years later, a compound of lanthanum and hydrogen was found to superconduct under still <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hydrogen-rich-compound-may-be-record-breaking-superconductor">&nbsp;chilly conditions, but even closer to room temperature</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/18</em>). Both materials require pressures too high for practical use.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to understand how the new superconductor fits in with other hydrides. Theoretical calculations of how similar hydrides behave wouldn’t suggest that such a material would be superconducting at the reported temperatures and pressures, says theoretical physicist Lilia Boeri of the Sapienza University of Rome. “For me, it looks very strange,” Boeri says. “It’s something completely unexpected…. If it’s true, it’s very different from the other hydrides.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antibody-injection-help-endometriosis">An antibody injection could one day help people with endometriosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>An experimental treatment for endometriosis, a painful gynecological disease that affects some 190 million people worldwide, may one day offer new hope for easing symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monthly antibody injections <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abq5858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reversed telltale signs of endometriosis in monkeys,</a> researchers report February 22 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. The antibody targets IL-8, a molecule that whips up inflammation inside the scattered, sometimes bleeding lesions that mark the disease. After neutralizing IL-8, those hallmark lesions shrink, the team found.</p>



<p>The new treatment is “pretty potent,” says Philippa Saunders, a reproductive scientist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved with work. The study’s authors haven’t reported a cure, she points out, but their antibody does seem to have an impact. “I think it’s really very promising,” she says.</p>



<p>Many scientists think endometriosis occurs when bits of the uterine lining — the endometrium — slough off during menstruation. Instead of exiting via the vagina, they voyage in the other direction: up through the fallopian tubes. Those bits of tissue then trespass through the body, sprouting lesions where they land. They’ll glom onto the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder and other spots outside of the uterus and take on a life of their own, Saunders says. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="368" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_mr_endromitriosis_inline2.jpg" alt="A diagram of a woman's internal reproductive organ showing endometriosis lesions on the uterus, ovaries and bladder." class="wp-image-3122336" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_mr_endromitriosis_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022723_mr_endromitriosis_inline2-330x179.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122336">The gynecological disease endometriosis is marked by telltale lesions (red) that can occur on the uterus (pink), ovaries (white), bladder (yellow) and other places in the body.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122336">TUMEGGY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The lesions can grow nerve cells, form tough nubs of tissue and even bleed during menstrual cycles. They can also kick off chronic bouts of pelvic pain. If you have endometriosis, you can experience “pain when you urinate, pain when you defecate, pain when you have sex, pain when you move around,” Saunders says. People with the disease can also struggle with infertility and depression, she adds. “It’s really nasty.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>Painful symptoms</h3>



<p>Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease, but it can take years before people receive a diagnosis. Here are some signs of the disease:</p>



<ul>
<li>Painful periods</li>



<li>Pain during and/or after sex</li>



<li>Pain during urination and defecation</li>



<li>Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods</li>



<li>Infertility</li>



<li>Fatigue</li>



<li>Diarrhea and/or constipation</li>



<li>Bloating and/or nausea</li>
</ul>

</div>





<p>Once diagnosed, patients face a dearth of treatment options — there’s no cure, only therapies to alleviate symptoms. Surgery to remove lesions can help, but symptoms often come back. </p>



<p>The disease affects at least 10 percent of girls, women and transgender men in their reproductive years, Saunders says. And people typically suffer for years — about eight on average — before a diagnosis. “Doctors consider menstrual pelvic pain a very common thing,” says Ayako Nishimoto-Kakiuchi, a pharmacologist at Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in Tokyo. Endometriosis “is underestimated in the clinic,” she says. “I strongly believe that this disease has been understudied.”</p>



<p>Hormonal drugs that stop ovulation and menstruation can also offer relief, says Serdar Bulun, a reproductive endocrinologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago not involved with the new study. But those drugs come with side effects and aren&#8217;t ideal for people trying to become pregnant. “I see these patients day in and day out,” he says. “I see how much they suffer, and I feel like we are not doing enough.”</p>



<p>Nishimoto-Kakiuchi’s team engineered an antibody that grabs onto the inflammatory factor IL-8, a protein that scientists have previously fingered as one potential culprit in the disease. The antibody acts like a garbage collector, Nishimoto-Kakiuchi says. It grabs IL-8, delivers it to the cell’s waste disposal machinery, and then heads out to snare more IL-8.</p>





<p>The team tested the antibody in cynomolgus monkeys that were surgically modified to have the disease. (Endometriosis rarely shows up spontaneously in these monkeys, the scientists discovered previously after screening more than 600 females.)&nbsp; The team treated 11 monkeys with the antibody injection once a month for six months. In these animals, lesions shriveled and the adhesive tissue that glues them to the body thinned out, too. Before this study, Nishimoto-Kakiuchi says, the team didn’t think such signs of endometriosis were reversible.&nbsp;</p>
