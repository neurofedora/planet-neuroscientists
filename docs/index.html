                <p><strong>Wanting to go to a conference but worried about the expense? Final-year PhD student, Naomi Thorne, shares all of the places you can apply for funding, from the conference organisers to Biotech companies. Happy conferencing!</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Conferences are a fantastic opportunity for early-career researchers. It’s an opportunity to share your work with like-minded scientists, expand your network by meeting academics and hear directly from experts in your field. Not to mention, there are great opportunities to socialise with other PhD students: eating, drinking, exploring and enjoying some time away from the lab. However, they can be pretty expensive! Many conference trips cost upwards of £300, and that’s just for the registration. Factoring in transport and accommodation, my trip to the Quality Control in Life Processes conference in Frankfurt, Germany, cost a little over £1000. It’s a</span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> lot</span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> of money, and the cost can be really off-putting when it comes to planning a conference trip. Thankfully, this financial barrier can be broken down by organisations that offer travel grants and bursaries for early-career researchers. As a final-year PhD student, who has secured funding from several different sources for my conference trips, I wanted to share the best places I’ve found to apply for funding. </span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_036dd4f65ed6497bb886a725340fb817~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_729,h_891,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="The location of the Wellcome Trust conference on the Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton."></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>1 - Your university</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the first places I checked was my university itself. Many institutions have funding available, either to all PhD students or on an application basis. Where I am studying, at the University of Southampton, the School of Biological Sciences offers one £250 bursary to all PhD students during their candidature. This was not readily advertised though – speak to your supervisor, as well as other PhD students, about opportunities like this, as they can be a very easy way to get some funding. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>2 - Your PhD funder</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Another good place to check is your PhD funding body. It is a good idea to visit their website or speak directly to trustees to see if they offer funding to current candidates. Of course, this will depend on who your project is funded by, but charities in particular may have money set aside specifically for these occasions. Those that operate on a smaller scale, with a lower number of students, are often very keen to support the students they have, so it is definitely worth asking.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>3 - </strong></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Conference organisers</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Often, the conference organisers offer a bursary scheme that you can apply for at the time of registration. Last year, I received a bursary for the Wellcome Trust conference on Trafficking Pathways in Neurodegeneration which covered 50% of the conference fee. They are usually awarded based on early-career status and the quality of the abstract submitted, with priority given to those giving a poster presentation or talk. There are usually a limited number too – there were about 10 at my conference – so make sure you get in early. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>4 - </strong></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Societies</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Scientific societies are another great place to find travel awards, but you usually have to be a member for at least a year in order to apply for them. Knowing this, I would say it is worth getting a membership early on in your PhD, so that you have the year of membership behind you by the time you want to attend a conference! Some universities will even pay for one society membership for their students, so check their policy on this before you sign up. Sometimes societies offer funding for any conference, but often they are limited to that society’s flagship event, for example the British Neuroscience Association has a bursary scheme which is specifically for the Festival of Neuroscience. Some examples of societies with such schemes are listed below: </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Royal Society of Chemistry</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Royal Society of Biology </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Company of Biologists (BSCB)</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">British Neuroscience Association </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Physiological Society</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">British Pharmacological Society </span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>5 - </strong></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Charities</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Some larger charities have travel awards available to early-career researchers, but they, understandably, want the conference you attend to be related to their work and research interests. They often require you to write up a report about the conference afterwards, which is a fair task in return for the money! For example, you can apply to Guarantors of BRAIN, as long as your work and conference is related to the field of neuroscience.  </span></span></p>

<p>	<span style="color: #a5698a;"><strong>6 - </strong></span><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Biotech companies</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Finally, scientific and biotech companies are a good place to look. Many of them now offer travel grants which you can apply for, though they are a bit more selective; they have a small, set number of winners. Most of them judge this by looking at your conference abstract, though BioLegend asks you to explain how their products have enabled your work. I was lucky enough to win a £400 award from BioLegend last year after I wrote 200 words on how I used their antibodies in my immunofluorescence staining. It was definitely the quickest application I made for funding! Examples of companies with travel grant competitions are listed below:</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://Antibodies.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Antibodies.com</span></span></a></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">BioLegend</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hello Bio </span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Proteintech (conference-specific)</span></span>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>There are a few important things to remember when it comes to applying for funding, so I will leave you with a few quick tips:</strong></span></span></em></p>
<ul>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Always check the dates</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – some travel awards only open at certain times of the year, but run out quite quickly. Make a note of these time periods to make sure you don’t miss out.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Don’t leave it too late</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – it will take time for people to get back to you, and you usually can’t apply for a conference you’ve already attended.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>You can apply to more than one source</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – don’t just wait to hear back from one place; apply to several! You can always withdraw an application if you source the money elsewhere.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Some places grant money more than once</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – many places have a one-time policy on bursaries, but some don’t, so it’s important to check this if you have applied before but are heading to another conference. For example, Guarantors of BRAIN allows a maximum of three awards per person, but only one per year.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Don’t be disheartened if you don’t get the first ones you apply for </strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">– some of these awards can be really competitive! There were several that I didn’t win or hear back from, but you just have to keep going.</span></span></p></li>
  <li><p><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>Check the terms of each funding application</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> – some places require you to have an accepted abstract for a conference, but others only require proof of registration.</span></span></p></li>

<p>An Elsevier journal has issued just over 100 expressions of concern for papers published by a group of researchers led by the French microbiologist Didier Raoult, who also notched a new retraction – <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dRaoult">his tenth</a> – in a separate publication.</p>



<p>As we and others <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/08/journals-retract-six-didier-raoult-papers-for-ethics-violations/">have reported</a>, Raoult’s work during the COVID-19 pandemic drew intense scrutiny from data sleuths, most notably Elisabeth Bik – whose critiques, which extended beyond his COVID studies, were met with vicious online trolling and a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01430-z">legal complaint</a> filed by Raoult himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The allegations prompted an ethics investigation by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products into Raoult’s research during his tenure at the <a href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/en/">IHU Méditerranée Infection</a>, in Marseille, which he led between 2011 and his retirement as director in 2022. That inquiry <a href="https://ansm.sante.fr/actualites/inspection-a-lihu-mediterranee-infection-et-a-lap-hm-lansm-saisit-a-nouveau-la-justice-et-engage-des-poursuites-administratives">found</a> “serious shortcomings and non-compliances with the regulations for research involving the human person.”</p>



<p>The 101 expressions of concern come for papers Raoult and his colleagues published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=New%20Microbes%20and%20New%20Infections&amp;cid=312001&amp;qs=Expression%20of%20concern"><em>New Microbes and New Infections</em></a>. Here’s an example of one of the EoC’s, for “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297516000044">Genome sequence and description of Anaerosalibacter massiliensis sp. nov.</a>,” which Raoult’s group published in March 2016:</p>



<span id="more-129062"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been brought to the attention of the journal regarding potential non-compliance with Elsevier’s publishing ethics policies regarding the appropriate conduct of research involving human participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is investigating the concerns as detailed in the recent Publisher’s Note [1], including contacting the authors, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and Elsevier’s policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Expression of Concern will remain appended to the article until the investigation has been completed. If the journal can reach a conclusion, it will take any action that is deemed necessary.

<p>Concerns have been raised about a number of articles authored by researchers affiliated with Aix-Marseille Université IHU &#8211; Méditerranée-Infection, Marseille that have been published in New Microbes and New Infections (NMNI). The substance of these concerns relates to the articles’ adherence to Elsevier’s publishing ethics policies and the appropriate conduct of research involving human participants.</p>



<p>New Microbes and New Infections, supported by Elsevier’s Research Integrity and Publishing Ethics (RI&amp;PE) Centre of Expertise, has launched an investigation into these allegations, following due process outlined by the Committee On Publication Ethics (COPE) by confidentially consulting with the authors and, where necessary, liaising with the institution where the studies took place.</p>



<p>We have appointed Dr. Jim Gray, Consultant Microbiologist at the Birmingham Children’s and Women’s Hospitals, U.K. in the role of independent Publishing Ethics Advisor, to support the investigation.</p>



<p>If necessary, corrections will be made to the scientific record when the investigation into each article is completed, in accordance with the journal’s Publishing Ethics policy.</p>

<p>Other researchers <a href="https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4">found issues</a> with the ethics approvals of 456 studies published by researchers affiliated with the IHU Méditerranée Infection, including “248 [that] were conducted with the same ethics approval number, even though the subjects, samples, and countries of investigation were different.”</p>



<p>Raoult also had nearly 50 papers in PLOS journals <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/13/plos-flags-nearly-50-papers-by-controversial-french-covid-researcher-for-ethics-concerns/">subjected to expressions of concern for ethical issues</a> in 2022.</p>



<p>The new retraction involves a 2017 paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em> titled “Culturomics and Amplicon-based Metagenomic Approaches for the Study of Fungal Population in Human Gut Microbiota.” According to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-58471-3">the notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Editors have retracted this Article.</p>



<p>After publication of this paper concerns about ethical oversight of this study were brought to the attention of the Editors. The paper cites approval from an institutional ethics committee in France, but samples used in this study were also sourced from Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Niger. The Authors were not able to provide documentation of approval from ethics committees in these countries, or of compliance with local regulations regarding the use of such samples in research.</p>



<p>Stéphane Ranque, Esam I. Azhar, Muhammad Yasir, Asif A. Jiman-Fatani, Didier Raoult, and Fadi Bittar disagree with the retraction. Ibrahim Hamad and Hervé Tissot-Dupont did not reply to the correspondence from the Editors.</p>

<p>Sometime last summer, Ben Mol, an obstetrician-gynecology researcher in Australia, and his colleagues were adapting a <a href="https://www.eshre.eu/Guidelines-and-Legal/Guidelines/Unexplained-infertility">European guideline</a> on unexplained infertility when they came across <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09513590600604673">a 2006 paper from Maria Luisa Casini</a>, a pharmacologist in Rome, that gave them pause because of results that were not statistically significant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When they looked further, they ended in a rabbit hole. Casini’s previous work revealed identical patient data <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C89877E0702EC694ED5D115453257D#1">across papers published two years apart</a>, despite purporting to come from different groups of patients. The similarities were striking: In <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.09.048">the 2006 paper</a>, the women’s mean height was 165.5 centimeters; in the study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15237003/">published two years earlier</a> that reported having more than triple the number of participants, the women had the exact same mean height, with the same standard deviation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://whirlcre.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ESHREADAPTEDGuideline-October23.pdf">guideline update would eventually lead to</a> half of the included trials <a href="https://whirlcre.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/TECHNICAL-REPORT.pdf">being</a> <a href="https://whirlcre.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/TECHNICAL-REPORT.pdf">flagged for integrity issues</a>, and as a result, left out of the Australian version of the guideline. From that one  paper by Casini that had initially raised doubts, the team was able to unearth a trail of suspicious data connected to several ob-gyns in Italy. An Italian medical society and one of the implicated authors have threatened to sue over the allegations, claiming the complaints were made to interfere with a high-profile society election, but the papers are now part of a wider Elsevier investigation.</p>



<span id="more-129059"></span>



<p>After digging up the first set of suspiciously similar data, the problems seemed to get worse. The team eventually identified a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BC68A825D592B1EF1A639022FEDE3D#1">series of nine papers</a> involving several other authors from the University of Perugia – Vittorio Unfer, Sandro Gerli and Gian Carlo Di Renzo – <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/2E24FFD9FFD33082782F98E8861E21#2">that appeared</a> to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1BA1967E4767C8C8751C006422C98D#1">have identical data</a> between them. The duplications are “not 100% impossible,” says Mol. But the problem exists in more than just one paper, he says. And the papers have been cited 750 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>So far, only one of the papers has been retracted after the first author, Gerli, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/FD8D01B0B17AA4BBB164B1CB24F2E7#1">blamed an uncredited student</a> who “unbeknownst to us at the time, adapted the 2003 paper and submitted it as novel work.” Another has <a href="https://karger.com/goi/article/89/1/71/894474/Expression-of-concern-Low-Dose-of-Ethinyl">an expression of concern</a> that notes the authors are unable “to ascertain whether any similarities are coincidental or otherwise” because they no longer have access to the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol has written to the authors of the papers for an explanation and has heard back from only one — Di Renzo, who was the chair of the ob-gyn department at University of Perugia, the home institution for several of the authors, at the time the papers were published. In a September 2023 email, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Email-From-Di-Renzo-to-Mol.pdf">Di Renzo asked Mol for</a> an “unreserved, full apology” for his allegations, “if you don’t want us to end up in court.” But he stopped short of offering a scientific explanation, writing that he was not the first nor the corresponding author for any of the publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Di Renzo pointed out that the complaints made by Mol “refer to works of over twenty years ago,” and adds, “in any case I am preparing detailed answers to your accusations with the authors.” Mol said he has not received another response addressing his concerns. Di Renzo has not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Di Renzo’s email came after Mol had contacted the Italian Society for Gynecology and Obstetrics (SIGO) about his concerns. The Society had nominated Di Renzo to lead the umbrella group – The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics – but he did not get elected after the vote in October 2023. The president of SIGO at the time, Nicola Colacurci, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Letter_to_Prof.Mol_22.08.23.pdf">wrote to Mol</a> in August 2023 that the timing of his complaint intended “to interfere with the process of election” and that he had “made false statements purporting to be fact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Colacurci accused Mol of being a “serial complainer” writing that other researchers deemed his previous investigations “intimidating” and subject to “accusations of racism.” The letter ends with another legal threat “to protect our Society, Prof. Di Renzo and all our members.” Neither Colacurci nor the current president of the Society have responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only one of the journals, <em>Reproductive BioMedicine Online</em>, has responded to our queries about the papers, writing that Elsevier is conducting a wider investigation involving many journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol has identified dodgy work in his field before, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/18/ob-gyn-who-called-criticism-racist-and-hate-speech-earns-retraction-several-expressions-of-concern/">previously calling out</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">dozens of suspicious clinical trials</a>. His efforts have contributed to the retraction of well over 100 papers and dozens of expressions of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is unbelievable how big this problem is,” Mol says. “It’s simply unacceptable. Worrying and unacceptable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For me, it&#8217;s not about pointing at people or punishing people,” he adds. “It&#8217;s about getting these problematic papers out of the system.”</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Jim Bower will talk about the paper &quot;Metabolic activity organizes olfactory representations&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Hearing and vision sensory systems are tuned to the natural statistics of acoustic and
electromagnetic energy on earth and are evolved to be sensitive in ethologically relevant
ranges. But what are the natural statistics of odors, and how do olfactory systems exploit
them? Dissecting an accurate machine learning model (Lee et al., 2022) for human odor
perception, we find a computable representation for odor at the molecular level that can
predict the odor-evoked receptor, neural, and behavioral responses of nearly all
terrestrial organisms studied in olfactory neuroscience. Using this olfactory
representation (principal odor map [POM]), we find that odorous compounds with similar POM
representations are more likely to co-occur within a substance and be metabolically
closely related; metabolic reaction sequences (Caspi et al., 2014) also follow smooth
paths in POM despite large jumps in molecular structure. Just as the brain’s visual
representations have evolved around the natural statistics of light and shapes, the
natural statistics of metabolism appear to shape the brain’s representation of the
olfactory world.</p>

<p>A JAMA journal has retracted a paper on vaping it published two months ago after the researchers alerted the editors to “significant coding errors” and other problems with the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2814489">Efficacy of Electronic Cigarettes vs Varenicline and Nicotine Chewing Gum as an Aid to Stop Smoking: A Randomized Clinical Trial</a>,” was written by a group from China led by Zhao Liu, of the Department of Tobacco Control and Prevention of Respiratory Disease at China-Japan Friendship Hospital, in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the researchers, the study found use of vapes was no worse than a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/quit-smoking/quit-smoking-medications/how-to-use-quit-smoking-medicines/how-to-use-varenicline.html">prescription medication</a>, and better than nicotine gum, at helping people quit smoking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper received a significant amount of attention in the <a href="https://jamanetwork.altmetric.com/details/158864207/news">medical and lay press</a> and on <a href="https://jamanetwork.altmetric.com/details/158864207">social media</a> (full disclosure: <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/e-cigarettes-best-nicotine-gum-smoking-cessation-2024a10001ym?src=rss">Medscape, where Adam works, covered it</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the March 29 <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2817155">retraction notice</a> for the paper, which originally appeared online in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em> January 29: </p>



<span id="more-129045"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Unfortunately, we have found significant coding errors that are difficult to rectify. We also discovered discrepancies in the calculation process that cast doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the reported findings. Consequently, we believe it is necessary to retract the article to uphold the integrity of scientific research and maintain the trust of our readers and the medical community. All coauthors agree with this retraction. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or confusion this may cause.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Liu told us in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As we explained to the JAMA editors …, after this paper was published, we planned to conduct a secondary analysis. During this process, we found &#8220;109 participants, who should be in NRT group, were wrongly placed in the EC group, while another 109 participants, who should be in EC group, were wrongly placed in the NRT group. We immediately did the analysis, and found that the main results were changed&#8221;.</p>



<p>So we immediately wrote to the editors to explain this issue and requested to withdraw the paper. </p>



<p>Also, to the best of our knowledge, there are no other articles affected by these problems.</p>

<p>The journal <em>Social Influence</em> will be issuing expressions of concern for four papers by Nicolas Guéguen, a marketing researcher whose work has long been dogged by allegations, Retraction Watch has learned. </p>



<p>Guéguen <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dGu%25u00e9guen">has to date </a>has lost at least three papers to retraction, and has received many more <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/28/bust-size-and-hitchhiking-author-earns-five-expressions-of-concern/">expressions of concern</a>, for his questionable studies. However, his institution, the Université de Bretagne-Sud, <a href="https://osf.io/98nzj/">cleared him of wrongdoing</a> in 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guéguen made a name for himself for his quirky studies – often about human sexuality – like one purporting to find <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.105.4.1294-1298">women with bigger breasts</a> were more likely to be successful hitchhikers; and one which claimed to find <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/09/heard-about-the-study-claiming-men-who-carry-guitar-cases-are-more-attractive-its-been-retracted/">men with guitar cases </a>are more attractive to women. (The first of those articles has an expression of concern; the second <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/09/heard-about-the-study-claiming-men-who-carry-guitar-cases-are-more-attractive-its-been-retracted/">was retracted</a> in 2020.)</p>



<span id="more-129032"></span>



<p>The four new expressions of concern involve these articles which the journal, a Taylor &amp; Francis title, published between 2007 and 2015:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510701316177">Courtship compliance: The effect of touch on women&#8217;s behaviour</a> (2007)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2011.561556">“Say it with flowers”: The effect of flowers on mating attractiveness and behavior</a> (2011)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510802628173">Mimicry and seduction: An evaluation in a courtship context</a> (2009)</li>

</ul>



<p>According to an email from journal editor in chief Ilja van Beest that was seen by Retraction Watch, the notices for all four articles will read:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis and the Editor-in-Chief of Social Influence, Prof. dr. Ilja van Beest, have been made aware of scientific concerns regarding the integrity of research published by Dr. Nicholas [sic] Guéguen. The Editorial team conducted a rigorous review of all work published by Dr. Nicholas [sic] Guéguen in Social Influence and have significant concerns regarding four articles [listed below]. Concerns are related but not limited to reliability of data, ethical consent and replicability of findings.</p>



<p>Together with the journal’s editorial team, Taylor &amp; Francis are conducting an investigation into these articles. Due to a lack of response from Dr. Nicholas [sic] Guéguen these investigations remain open. This Expression of Concern will remain until investigations are judged to be complete by the Publisher.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Guéguen has not responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nick Brown, a data sleuth who <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-expose-shoddy-and-questionable-research">with James Heathers</a> has been <a href="https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2017/12/a-review-of-research-of-dr-nicolas.html">calling critical attention</a> to Guéguen’s work for years – including the four articles in <em>Social Influence</em> – said he was:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>pleased to see that four of the articles that this author published in Social Influence are being flagged with Expressions of Concern, and I am particularly glad to learn the investigation&nbsp; into them is not over. I hope that retractions will follow, and that the journal will also investigate the 10 other articles (co-)authored by Guéguen that it has published, most of which suffer from the same problems as these four.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/874795760/0/oupblogpsychology/">The hidden toll of war</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/the-hidden-toll-of-war/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Hidden-Tolls-of-War-image-3-480x185.png" link_thumbnail="1" decoding="async" /></a><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2024/04/the-hidden-toll-of-war/">The hidden toll of war</a></p><p>During war, the news media often focus on civilian injuries and deaths due to explosive weapons. But the indirect health impacts of war among civilians occur more frequently—often out of sight and out of mind.</p><p>These indirect impacts include communicable diseases, malnutrition, exacerbations of chronic noncommunicable diseases, maternal and infant disorders, and mental health problems. They are caused primarily by forced displacement of populations and by damage to civilian infrastructure, including farms and food supply systems, water treatment plants, healthcare and public health facilities, and networks for electric power, communication, and transportation.</p><p>Increasingly, damage to civilian infrastructure is caused by targeted attacks—as a strategy of war, resulting in reduced access to food, safe drinking water, healthcare, and shelter. When water treatment plants and supply lines are damaged during war, people often have no choice but to drink water from sources that may be contaminated with microorganisms or toxic substances. Healthcare facilities have been increasingly targeted during war; for example, during the first 18 months of the war in Ukraine, there were 1,014 attacks on healthcare facilities, which injured and killed many patients and healthcare workers, and caused much damage, which reduced access to healthcare for many people.</p><p>Globally, there are now more than 108 million people who have been displaced from their homes, many as a result of war. Most of these displaced people have been internally displaced within their own countries, often facing greater health and security risks than refugees, who have fled to other countries. And during war, many more people live in continual fear that they may be forcibly displaced.</p><p>Major categories of communicable diseases during war include diarrheal diseases and respiratory disorders. These diarrheal diseases result mainly from decreased access to safe drinking water and reduced levels of sanitation and hygiene, leading to increased fecal-oral transmission of bacterial and viral agents. Among respiratory disorders, measles is of great concern because it is highly contagious and associated with high mortality rates among unimmunized children. Another major concern is tuberculosis, which can spread easily among war-affected populations and is difficult to treat without continuity of care. Crowding in bomb shelters, refugee camps, and other locations during war facilitates the spread of both diarrheal diseases and respiratory disorders. Disruption of public health services leads to reduced access to immunizations and reduced resources to investigate and control outbreaks of communicable disease. During war, bacterial resistance to antibiotics increases because people have decreased access to antibiotics and therefore take inappropriate antibiotics or shortened courses of treatment.</p><p>Malnutrition often increases during war, thereby increasing the risks of acquiring and dying from many communicable diseases. Infants and children are at greatest risk of becoming malnourished and suffering from its adverse health consequences. Micronutrient deficiencies during pregnancy can lead to birth defects. And severe malnutrition during war can increase the risk of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes in later life.</p><p>During war, exacerbations of preexisting cases of noncommunicable disease increase, mainly because of reduced access to medical care and medications for treating common chronic diseases. For example, a survey by the World Health Organization in Ukraine in 2022 found that about half of the respondents experienced reduced access to medical care and almost one-fourth could not acquire necessary medications that they needed. Without these medications, people with hypertension were at increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, people with asthma were at increased risk of life-threatening attacks, people with diabetes were at increased risk of serious complications, and people with epilepsy were at increased risk of seizures.</p><p>War exerts adverse effects on reproductive health. Access to prenatal care, postpartum and neonatal care, and reproductive health services are frequently decreased. As a result, complications of pregnancy, including maternal deaths, occur more frequently and there are increased rates of infant deaths and of infants being born prematurely or with low birthweight.</p><p>Mental and behavioral disorders occur more frequently during war, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety, alcoholism and drug abuse, and suicide. There are many contributing factors to increasing the risk of these disorders, including physical and sexual trauma, witnessing of atrocities, forced displacement, family separation, deaths of loved ones, loss of employment and education, and uncertainty about the future.</p><p>Violations of human rights and international humanitarian law occur frequently during war. In addition to those already mentioned, these violations include gender-based violence, summary executions, kidnapping, denial of humanitarian aid, and use of indiscriminate weapons, such as antipersonnel landmines.</p><p>The possible use of nuclear weapons represents a profound threat whenever nuclear powers are engaged in war, partly because these weapons could be launched by accident or because of misinterpretation or miscommunication. Even a small nuclear war could cause huge numbers of deaths and severe injuries and could lower temperatures globally, leading to widespread famine.</p><p>Environmental damage during war can result from chemical contamination of air, water, and soil; presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance; release of ionizing radiation from nuclear power plants or conventional weapons containing radioactive materials (“dirty bombs”); destruction of the built environment; and damage to animal habitats and ecosystems. In addition, war and the preparation for war consume large amounts of fossil fuels, which generate greenhouse gases, which, in turn, cause global warming.</p><p>Protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during war and improved humanitarian assistance can reduce the indirect health impacts of war. But the only way to eliminate these impacts is to eliminate war. The risk of war can be reduced by resolving disputes before they turn violent; by reducing the root causes of war, such as socioeconomic inequities, militarism, ethnic and religious hatred, poor governance, and environmental stress; and by strengthening the infrastructure for peace. Peace can be achieved and sustained by rehabilitating nations and reintegrating people after war has ended, strengthening civil society, promoting the rule of law, ensuring citizen participation, and holding aggressors accountable.</p><p><strong>Barry S.

<p>An official journal of the Japanese government has retracted a 2021 paper over concerns about misconduct in the work, which was performed in a national research center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/foodsafetyfscj/12/1/12_D-24-00004/_article#article-overiew-abstract-wrap">retraction notice</a> for the paper, titled “Development and Evaluation of Fluorescence Immunochomatography for Rapid and Sensitive Detection of Thermophilic Campylobacter”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Food Safety decided to retract this article in which the primary author misconducted as reported from the primary author’s affiliation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Far more details are available in <a href="https://www.nihs.go.jp/oshirasejoho/Press-Release/20231226/index.html">materials published last December</a> by Japan’s National Institute of Health Sciences, where the first author of the article, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiroshi-asakura-84216350">Hiroshi Asakura</a>, is chief researcher. According to a <a href="https://www.nihs.go.jp/oshirasejoho/Press-Release/20231226/index.html">press release</a> dated Dec. 26, 2023: </p>



<span id="more-129027"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As a result of the investigation, it was found that the description of the specimen used in the Campylobacter quantitative test and the test results in the paper differed from the research content that was considered to be the original data of the paper. It was determined that the fabrication and falsification of papers (specified misconduct) occurred due to a gross neglect of the duty of care. …<br><em><br></em>An external investigation committee consisting of external experts was established to conduct an investigation. As a result of the investigation, it was determined that during the examination by the ISO/IEC 17025 accredited examination body, the department manager had fabricated, falsified and forged some examination materials, and had given false explanations based on these. </p>

<p>Here are the Institute’s reports:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/03/six-years-of-open-science-indicators-data/">Six years of Open Science Indicators data</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Q1 2024 (March) <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">PLOS Open Science Indicators (OSI) results</a> shows that rates of data repository use and code sharing in PLOS articles reached new highs in 2023, while preprint adoption has plateaued since the pandemic. This latest data release includes six years of OSI data.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">Download the data</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="958" height="556" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/6-years-of-OSI-data.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22308" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/6-years-of-OSI-data.png 958w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/6-years-of-OSI-data-300x174.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/6-years-of-OSI-data-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px"></figure>



<p><strong><em>Figure</em></strong><em>: Open Science Indicators for PLOS content (solid line) and comparator data (dotted line) by publication quarter 2018-2023.</em></p>



<p>The latest OSI dataset, produced in partnership with DataSeer, includes all 107,719 PLOS research articles published between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2023, and a smaller comparator corpus (21,991 of articles). For PLOS articles the latest results show:</p>



<ul><li>The rate of data repository use reached a new high of 31% in Q4 2024 (up from 30% in Q3), and an annual high of 29% in 2023 overall (28% in 2022)</li><li>The rate of code sharing was 16% (compared to 17% in Q3), and reached a yearly high of 16% overall (15% in 2022)</li><li>The rate of preprint sharing fell to 24% (compared to 25% in Q3), and was 24% for 2023 overall (24% in 2022)</li></ul>



<p>For comparator articles however, preprint adoption continued to rise in 2023, reaching 31% in Q4 2023. The difference between comparators and PLOS is mainly driven by the use of the Research Square platform by articles published in Springer Nature journals, and the use of Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) preprints by JMIR articles.</p>



<p><strong>Recent and up-coming OSI developments</strong></p>



<p>PLOS and DataSeer, and other &ldquo;solution providers&rdquo;, are collaborating with the UK Reproducibility Network on several Open Research Indicator pilots with UK institutions. See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1M-hAZEzAY">recent UKRN webinar</a> for an update on these pilots. We, also, recently <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/03/collaboratively-seeking-better-solutions-for-monitoring-open-science/">shared the results</a> of research involving research funders and institutions, where we sought to understand how they are, or are planning, to monitor Open Science (Research) practices in their contexts &ndash; and inform future OSI development.</p>



<p>The OSI dataset continues to be reused or cited by researchers and organizations outside of PLOS, including in a <a href="https://cca-reports.ca/reports/international-science-and-technology-partnerships/">report by the Council of Canadian Academies</a> in February 2024. Furthermore, an editorial in <em>PLOS Biology</em> that used OSI to understand the adoption of OS practices by its authors and set goals for 2024, has been included in the <a href="https://sfdora.org/resource/supporting-open-science-at-plos-biology/">Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) resource library</a> &ndash; a collection of materials to facilitate the development of responsible research and researcher assessment policies and practices.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the fifth OSI, for measuring the prevalence of study registration (preregistration), is being prepared for a preliminary release in the next &ndash; June 2024 &ndash; public data release.</p>



<p>Finally, watch this space for results of a new study that uses OSI to explore the effects, or impact, of Open Science practices on articles that exhibit one or more OSIs.</p>

<p><strong>The Neuron as a Direct Data-Driven Controller</strong></p>



<p>In their preprint, Moore et al. (2024) provide an interesting perspective on how to think about neurons: rather than input-output devices, neurons are described as control units. In their framework, these neuronal control units receive input as feedback about their own output in a feedback loop which may involve the environment. In turn, the neurons try to control this feedback loop by adapting their output according to a neuron-specific objective function. To use the authors’ words, this scheme is “enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their control via synaptic feedback”.</p>



<p>These are ideas that have been fascinating for me since quite some time. For example, I have described similar ideas about the single-neuron perspective and the objective function of single neurons <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/">in a previous blog post</a>. The work of Moore et al. (2024) is an interesting new perspective, not only because it clearly states the main ideas of their approach, but also because the ideas are shaped by a mathematical perspective of linear control theoretical approaches (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>). </p>



<p>To probe the framework, the paper shows how several disconnected observations in neurophysiology emerge in such a framework, like <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_plasticity">STDP</a> (spike time-dependent plasticity). STDP is a learning rule that has been found in slice work and had a huge impact on theoretical ideas about neuronal plasticity. STDP can be dissected into a “causal” part (postsynaptic activity comes after presynaptic activity) and an “a-causal” part (presynaptic after postsynaptic). The a-causal part of STDP makes a lot of sense in the framework of Moore et al. (2024) since the pre-synaptic activity could in this case be interpreted as a meaningful feedback signal for the neuron. These conceptual ideas that do not require a lot of math to understand them are – in my opinion – the main strength of the paper.</p>



<p>The proposed theoretical framework however also comes with limitations. It is based on a linear system; and I feel that the paper is too focused on mathematics and linear algebra, while the interesting aspects are rather conveyed in the non-mathematical part of the study. I found Figure 3 with a dissection of feedback and feedforward contributions in experimental data quite unclear and confusing. And the mathematical or algorithmic procedure how a neuron computes the ideal control signal given its objective function did not sound very biologically plausible to me (it included quite a lot complex linear algebra transformations).</p>



<p>Overall, I think it is a very interesting and inspiring paper. I highly recommend reading the Discussion. This discussion includes a nice sentence that summarizes this framework and distinguishes it from other frameworks like predictive coding: “[In this framework,] the controller neuron does not just predict the future input but aims to influence it through its output”. Check it out!</p>



<p><strong>A Learning Algorithm beyond Backpropagation</strong></p>



<p>This study by Song et al. (2024) includes several bold claims in the title and abstract. The promise is to provide a learning algorithm that is “more efficient and effective” than backpropagation. Backpropagation is the foundation of almost all “AI” systems, so this would be no small feat.</p>



<p>The main idea of the algorithm is to clamp the activity of input and output neurons with the teaching signals and wait until the activity of all layers in the middle converge (in a “relaxation” process), and then fix this configuration by weight changes. This is quite different conceptually from backpropagation, where the activity of output neurons is not clamped but compared to target activities, and differences are mathematically propagated back to middle layer neurons. Song et al. (2024) describe this relaxation process in their algorithm, which they term “prospective configuration” learning, as akin to relaxation of masses connected via springs. They also highlight a conceptual and mathematical relation to “energy-based networks” such as Hopfield networks (Hopfield, 1982). This is an aspect that I found surprising because such networks are well-known and less efficient than standard deep learning; so why is the proposed method here better than traditional energy-based methods? I did not find a satisfying answer to this question.</p>



<p>One aspect that I found particularly compelling about prospective configuration was that weights are updated not independently from each other but all together simultaneously, as opposed to backpropagation. Intuitively, this sounds like a very compelling idea. Thinking of it, it is surprising that backpropagation works so well although errors for each neuron are updated independently from each other. But as a consequence, learning rates need to be incremental to prevent a scenario where weight changes in input layers make the simultaneously applied weight changes in deeper layers meaningless, which is a limitation of backpropagation. It seems that prospective configuration does not have this limitation.</p>



<p>Is this algorithm biologically plausible? The authors seem to suggest this between the lines, but I found it hard to judge. The authors do not match the bits and pieces of their algorithm to biological entities, so I found it not easy to judge the potential correspondences. Given the physical analogies (“relaxation”, “springs”), I would expect that weights in these energy-based networks are symmetric (which is not biologically realistic). The energy function (Equation 6) seems to be almost symmetric, and I find it hard to imagine this algorithm to work properly without symmetric weights. The authors discuss this issue briefly in the Discussion, but I would have loved to hear the opinion of experts on this topic. One big disadvantage of the journal Nature Neuroscience is that it does not provide open reviews. Apparently, the paper was reviewed by Friedeman Zenke, Karl Friston, Walter Senn and Joel Zylberberg, all of whom are highly reputed theoreticians. It would have added <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> to read the opinions of these reviewers from relatively diverse backgrounds.</p>



<p>Putting these considerations aside, do these prospective configuration networks really deliver what they promise? It’s hard to say. In every single figure of this extensive paper, prospective configuration seems to outcompete standard deep learning in basically all aspects – catastrophic forgetting, faster target alignment, et cetera. In the end, however, the algorithm seems to be computationally too demanding to be an efficient competitor for backpropagation as of now (see last part of Discussion). The potential solutions to circumvent this difficulty do not sound too convincing at this stage yet. I would have been really glad to read a second opinion on these points that are rather difficult to judge just from reading the paper. Again, it would have been very helpful to have open reviews.</p>



<p>Overall, I found the paper interesting and worth the read. Without second opinions, I found it however difficult to properly judge novelty (in comparison to related algorithms such as “target propagation” mentioned briefly, by Bengio (2014)) and potential impact relative to standard deep learning (possibility to speed up the algorithm; ability to generalize). Let me know if you have an opinion on this paper!</p>



<p><strong>Continuous vs. Discrete Representations in a Recurrent Network&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In this study, Meissner-Bernard et al. (2024) investigate a specific biological circuit that has been thought of as a good model for attractor networks, the zebrafish homologue of the olfactory cortex. The concept of discrete attractors mediated by recurrent connections has been highly influential for more than 40 years (Hopfield, 1982) and has been early-on thought of as a good model for circuits like the olfactory cortex that exhibit strong recurrent connections (Hasselmo and Barkai, 1995). Here, Meissner-Bernard et al. (2024) investigate how such a recurrent network model is affected by the implementation of precise synaptic balance. What is precise balance?</p>



<p>Individual neurons receive both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. In a precisely balanced network, these inputs of opposite influence are balanced for each neuron and also precisely in time. To some surprise, Meissner-Bernard et al. (2024) find that a recurrent network that implements such a precise balance does not exhibit discrete attractor dynamics but locally constrained dynamics that result in continuous rather than discrete sensory representations. The authors include a nice control by showing that the same network without this precise balance and a globally tuned inhibition instead does indeed exhibit discrete attractor dynamics.</p>



<p>One interesting feature of this study is that the model is constrained by a lot of detailed results from neurophysiological experiments. For example, the experimental results of my PhD work on precise synaptic balance &#8211; (Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018) &#8211; have been one of the main starting points for this modeling approach. Not only this but also other experimental evidence specific used to constrain the model had been acquired in the same lab where also the theoretical study by Meissner-Bernard et al. (2024) was conducted. Moreover, the authors suggest in the outlook section of the Discussion to use EM-based connectomics to dissect the neuronal ensembles in this balanced recurrent circuit. The lab of Rainer Friedrich is working on EM-connectomics with synaptic resolution for longer than a decade (Wanner and Friedrich, 2020). It is interesting to see this line of research that spans not only several decades of work with various techniques such as calcium imaging (Frank et al., 2019), whole-cell patch clamp (Blumhagen et al., 2011; Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018) and EM-based connectomics, but also attempts to connect all perspectives using modeling approaches.</p>

                "The Forward has a storied history. Founded in 1897 as a Yiddish-language daily, it soon became a national publication — and the most widely read Jewish newspaper in the world. In 1990, the English version of the Forward launched as a weekly publication. In 2019, the Forward went fully digital.

And on December 5, 2023, the Forward marked its latest milestone: The publication removed the paywall for all of its coverage....

In the first three months since dropping the paywall, the newsroom welcomed 1,254 new donors who hadn’t previously paid to access their coverage. From December 5, 2023 to March 15, 2024, the Forward received nearly $583,000 in donations under $5,000 — a 37% increase over paid subscription revenue during the same time frame the previous year.

In December, the month the Forward removed the paywall, the nonprofit saw a 103% increase in reader revenue under $5,000, compared to the same time last year. That includes 176 new monthly recurring donors, averaging $16/month. Previously, an annual digital subscription brought in $51.21, just over $4/month.

 

And among the Forward’s 17,000 existing subscribers, who were currently paying to read stories behind the paywall, only three readers complained and asked for their money back. “Three! It’s amazing,” Ehrlich laughed...."
