<p>The incentive systems that drive academic research underlie nearly every story we write: publication counts for promotion, pressure to produce positive results, hitting certain metrics, and so on. Critics have long <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1887">called for change in these systems</a>, but support for such change is hard to come by.</p>



<p>Several organizations are now putting more than $1 million toward reimagining hiring, promotion and tenure at U.S. universities. The program, called the<a href="https://www.ma3challenge.org/"> Modernizing Academic Appointment and Advancement (MA3) Challenge</a>, is seeking proposals for “bold, creative strategies to develop academic reward systems that foster a collaborative, responsive, and transparent research environment.”</p>



<p>Organized by the Open Research Community Accelerator (<a href="http://orcaopen.org/">ORCA</a>), the program will offer grants at two funding levels — $50,000 or $250,000 — over two years. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Dana Foundation, Rita Allen Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation have provided the funding, which totals $1.5 million.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133020"></span>



<p>To learn more about the program, we reached out to Greg Tananbaum, ORCA’s executive director, and Caitlin Schleicher, its director of community and partnerships. Their responses have been edited for clarity and brevity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Scientific research in this country is facing unprecedented pressures. How did the MA3 Challenge come into existence?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tananbaum:</strong> A consistent refrain – from rank-and-file scholars, department chairs, academic leaders, policymakers, and other interest holders – has been, “Nothing will really change until you tackle academic hiring and promotion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After many years and hundreds of consultations, it was clear to us that modernizing academic assessment and advancement was essential to enabling a more open, collaborative, inclusive, efficient, evidence-driven, and trustworthy research environment. So we began building a creative coalition to do just that. With backing from several philanthropies and in conjunction with the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Aspen Institute, we designed and launched the MA3 Challenge.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What are the specific issues within review, promotion and tenure systems that need critical attention?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tananbaum: </strong>Academic assessment and advancement systems at U.S. institutions often work against their own public missions. Instead of rewarding research that addresses real-world problems or broadens access, they still rely heavily on publications in brand-name journals, citation counts, and grant dollars. Community-engaged scholarship, though valuable, is usually dismissed as “service” and carries little weight in reviews.</p>



<p>This model disadvantages faculty who prioritize societal impact, mentorship, and a host of other values-based activities and outcomes. As a consequence, many researchers see this work as something of a career risk. To get hired, to get promoted, to get tenure, they need to adhere to a system that is significantly misaligned with their interests.</p>



<p>So it’s this dual misalignment – between institutional missions and credit/reward systems, and between why researchers get into this work in the first place and what it typically takes to move up the career ladder – that needs critical attention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal is to catalyze a cultural shift within academic institutions toward fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and transparent research environment. If we want the activities that advance a more collaborative, responsive, and transparent research environment to propagate at scale, we need to reward them properly.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Lots of people – including us – have been talking about changing the incentive structure for decades, with minimal movement. How do you think this project could move the needle?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Schleicher: </strong>There are several reasons incentive structures tend to be slow to change. First, it’s often easier and less time-consuming for institutions to focus on traditional outputs and metrics. Second, many institutions and disciplines have long-standing norms around what counts as excellence and impact, which can be difficult to shift. Third, shared governance structures can make decision-making complex, and there’s often a ‘chicken-and-egg’ dynamic over who should lead reform: faculty, who hold the authority over academic standards, or administrators, who need to signal and support change. Finally, reforms must compete with other institutional priorities, which can slow momentum. Taken together, these factors create a challenging environment for changing incentive structures.</p>



<p>We’re hoping this funding opportunity will stimulate real reform in several ways. First, we require that awardees spend no more than 50% of their time and budget on planning activities, including research, surveys, and discussions. We are prioritizing implementation-forward activities that will result in explicit changes in academic hiring and review, promotion, and tenure policies and practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, funding will support dedicated capacity for individuals at the institution to take on this institutional change work. Next, the projects will have a relatively narrow two-year timeline. This will spur participating institutions to be rigorous and focused in their approaches, as well as begin to provide case studies for other institutions engaging in their own modernization efforts. Finally, ORCA will be overseeing a community of practice for the cohort of awardees in the spring. This community is designed to accelerate learning, troubleshoot barriers and ensure that emerging insights can be efficiently disseminated to one another the broader higher education community.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What sort of buy-in are you requiring from the institutions to ensure the proposals have support?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Schleicher: </strong>To be eligible for this opportunity, we have asked that institutions have their academic administrators – provosts, vice provosts, deans, and/or department chairs, depending on the tier for which they are applying – serve as the principal investigator. If a proposal does not include an administrator responsible for faculty success and advancement in the PI position, we ask that applicants provide a letter of support from a member of the executive leadership team indicating the proposal team has support for this work.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What outcomes are you hoping for from the two-year projects?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tananbaum: </strong>We envision two key outcomes. At a local level, we expect that participants will have developed and tested innovative changes to their academic assessment and advancement programs. To the extent that these reforms are impactful, we hope that they will become part of the fabric of these departments and institutions, creating clearer alignment between missions and reward structures.</p>



<p>Second, we believe these projects, synthesized through the MA3 community of practice, will provide replicable roadmaps for change in how research is conducted, evaluated and shared.&nbsp; We know that many departments and institutions are conceptually aligned with these modernization efforts. But figuring out what that looks like in practice has proven difficult. The MA3 Challenge will demonstrate what is possible. It is our belief that the awardees will generate strategies that can be adapted and adopted across the higher education landscape.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: What happens after that? Are the funders committed to supporting further work or implementation of the projects that bear out?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tananbaum: </strong>We believe there is a robust appetite for this modernization effort. While we are at the earliest stages of what promises to be a long journey, we believe that demonstrating what’s possible here will lead to additional experimentation and implementation.</p>

<p>A Wiley journal has retracted a paper more than a year after a researcher reported the work was hers and had been stolen by a reviewer for another journal.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/25/reviewer-accused-stealing-manuscript-publishing-as-own-denies-refereeing/">reported in July</a>, Shafaq Aftab, now a lecturer at the University of Central Punjab in Pakistan, contacted Wiley in September 2024 after discovering <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sres.3076">a paper</a> published in one of its journals, <em>Systems Research and Behavioral Science </em>(<em>SRBS</em>), was the exact work she submitted to a different journal a year earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.3192">retraction notice</a>, issued October 1, states an investigation found &#8220;significant unattributed overlap with an unpublished manuscript&#8221; and data the authors provided to the journal were &#8220;insufficient to resolve the concerns.&#8221; Subsequently, &#8220;additional scientific errors were identified in the manuscript,&#8221; according to the notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133014"></span>



<p>In November 2023, Aftab had submitted her manuscript to <em>Information Development</em> (<em>IDV</em>), which rejected the article after two rounds of revisions, Aftab told Retraction Watch. After learning about the <em>SRBS </em>study, Aftab contacted <em>IDV </em>for answers. Stephen Parker, editor of the journal at the time, wrote in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IDV_Email_Response.pdf">a Sept. 22, 2024 email to Aftab</a> that Ghorbanzadeh was a reviewer of both versions of Aftab’s manuscript, and had recommended it be rejected. <em>IDV </em>“cannot be held accountable for this behavior from reviewers,” Parker wrote.<br><br>In an October 2 email to us, first author Davood Ghorbanzadeh said Wiley “failed to provide us with solid evidence to substantiate claims of plagiarism.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh, a social scientist at Islamic Azad University of Tehran North Branch in Iran, would not discuss the retraction further, writing “the issue of article retraction is a strictly professional matter between the authors, the journal, and Wiley Publishing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghorbanzadeh previously denied plagiarizing Aftab&#8217;s work, telling us the accusations were &#8220;entirely unfounded.&#8221; In an email, Ghorbanzadeh wrote he &#8220;did not review Ms. Aftab’s manuscript for [<em>IDV</em>], nor did I suggest its rejection, as has been claimed,” and that his study was &#8220;the result of original research conducted with academic integrity.&#8221;</p>



<p>The <em>SRBS</em> retraction is Ghorbanzadeh&#8217;s third for plagiarism in less than a year. A <a href="https://www.emerald.com/jhom/article-abstract/38/8/1182/1227612/RETRACTED-Empirical-nexus-of-corporate-social?redirectedFrom=fulltext">2024 study</a> in Emerald’s <em>Journal of Health Organization and Management</em> <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jhom-10-2024-0409/full/html">was retracted</a> in January because “a large portion of this article is taken, without attribution from an earlier, unpublished original work” by other coauthors. The notice also states all coauthors besides Ghorbanzadeh “would like it to be noted that they were not aware of this situation.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the December <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-07223-7">retraction notice</a> for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-024-06007-3">a paper</a> in <em>Current Psychology</em> states the article “significantly overlaps with a previously published article with a largely different authorship,” with one of the authors claiming “they were unaware of the submission of this article.”</p>



<p>The <em>SRBS</em> retraction notice states that Ghorbanzadeh disagrees with the decision to retract, while coauthors J. F. Espinosa-Cristia and N.S.G. Abdelrasheed agree with the move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Espinosa-Cristia, an associate professor at Federico Santa Maria Technical University in Chile, told us he could not talk about the case because his university is conducting an internal investigation involving the article retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other coauthors on the <em>SRBS </em>study did not return our messages seeking comment.<br><br>Aftab said she was “very happy” after a long struggle to have the plagiarism acknowledged and rectified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The retraction is a strong reminder that those who take credit for someone else’s work will eventually face consequences,” she told us. “My message to the research community is clear: If you try to steal someone’s hard work, be aware that there will be accountability. What one needs in such moments is patience and faith because truth and integrity always prevail.”</p>

<p>We don’t know if it’s the fastest retraction ever, but the speed is nonetheless notable: A journal retracted a paper 22 hours after a sleuth raised concerns about the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On August 9 just before noon, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/10/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-led-to-the-identification-of-hundreds-of-fraudulent-papers/">John Loadsman</a>, an <a href="http://www.loadsman.com/jal/">anesthesiologist</a> and journal editor in Australia, reached out to two journals to notify them of image similarities he had flagged on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loadsman asked the authors to clarify the “apparent identity” of a figure in a <a href="https://www.experimentalbiomedicalresearch.com/index.php/ebr/article/view/370/261">2023 paper</a> in <em>Experimental Biomedical Research. </em>The figure resembled one in a different paper by the same authors “representing different experimental conditions,” he wrote in his <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2751978BBD339018E354E93D51A15">PubPeer comment</a>. The second paper appeared in Wiley’s <em>International Journal of Endocrinology</em> in 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132999"></span>



<p>Loadsman said Wiley responded “almost immediately” saying they would investigate the paper in <em>IJE.</em> Geena De Rose, a communications director for Wiley, confirmed to us the older paper is being investigated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editor-in-chief of <em>EBR</em>, Hayrettin Ozturk, responded to Loadsman 14 hours after his initial email to say he was looking into the article. Just shy of 22 hours after Loadsman’s initial message, Ozturk sent another email saying the paper had been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ozturk confirmed to us Loadsman’s email initiated the inquiry, which “prompted a request for information from the authors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.experimentalbiomedicalresearch.com/index.php/ebr/article/view/370/262">retraction notice</a>, the duplicated image was “an erroneous presentation due to an inadvertent mistake and technical reasons.” So the authors requested the article be withdrawn, the notice states.</p>



<p>The “swift and rapid decision stems solely from our journal&#8217;s extremely sensitive policies on these matters,” Ozturk told us.</p>



<p>The 2019 <em>IJE </em>paper has been cited 15 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. <em>EBR </em>is not indexed on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://avesis.cu.edu.tr/spolat/iletisim">Sait Polat</a>, coauthor on the study, is a professor and a department chair&nbsp; at Cukurova University in Adana, Turkey. Neither Polat nor <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8219-2816">Gulfidan Coskun</a>, authors on the paper, responded to our request for comment. Coskun responded to Loadsman in a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2751978BBD339018E354E93D51A15">PubPeer comment</a> about the now-retracted paper stating the similarity between the figures arose “from the use of the same EDS-administered animal model in two separate studies, each approved by different ethics committees.” Coskun, a researcher at Cukurova University, said she had also contacted the journal.</p>



<p>Gulfidan also responded to Loadsman’s comments on the <em>IJE </em>article, citing an “unintentional error during the preparation of the figure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loadsman and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/28/first-time-scientific-sleuths-prompt-nine-retractions-for-neurosurgery-group/">Rene Aquarius</a>, a neurosurgery researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, have so far flagged <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=sait+polat">20 of Polat’s articles</a> for image issues on PubPeer, all within the last three months.</p>



<p>We’ve covered fast retractions before, although on the order of days, not hours. In 2021, we covered a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/01/07/this-retraction-is-one-of-the-fastest-i-ever-experienced-after-reporting-a-paper-to-a-journal-editor/">19-day retraction</a>, which sleuth Elisabeth Bik said was one of the fastest she had ever experienced. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/24/we-apologize-again-for-the-inadvertent-mistakes-during-the-assembly-of-data-due-to-our-carelessness/">another 2021 case</a> we called “reassuringly brisk,” a journal retracted a paper “within weeks” of issues being raised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A former bioinformatics student who operated a paper mill while at the University of Manchester has lost another paper, bringing his total to 11 retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameer-quazi-81628811a/">Sameer Quazi</a> had been enrolled in the school’s “PGCert” program in clinical bioinformatics, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/30/former-student-was-running-a-paper-mill-says-university-of-manchester/">Retraction Watch reported</a> in January when the university <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/statement-on-research-misconduct/">released a statement</a> saying an investigation found he “was running a paper mill.” The investigation panel had requested the retraction of 10 papers, but didn’t say which ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quazi’s most recent retraction, a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/12/5/849">2023 paper on antimicrobial agents</a>, appeared in the MDPI journal <em>Antibiotics</em>. According to the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/14/9/921">September 12 notice</a>, the journal was “unable to verify the identity, contribution, or affiliations of a number of the authors listed on this manuscript, nor could the origins of the study be confirmed.” The paper has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132990"></span>



<p>Maliha Tabassum Rashid and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3308-1321">Javid Ahmad Malik</a>, two of the authors listed on the article, said they “were not aware of this submission nor consented to its publication,” according to the notice. The fourth author, <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6999-972X">Shreelaxmi Gavas</a>, “did not provide a comment on this decision,” the notice states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rashid told us she never verified her <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/">ORCID ID</a> with the journal before publication, and she requested her name be removed from the original paper, but the journal refused. Neither Malik nor Gavas responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from MDPI told us <a href="https://www.zoologie.uni-halle.de/allgemeine_zoologie/staff/tragust/3077307_3416034/lukas_koch/?lang=en">Lukas Koch</a>, a researcher at Free University of Berlin, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7375790276952604672/?actorCompanyId=75733401">first alerted</a> the journal to issues with the paper in an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XUjFyAmXL4B6cgf5e56dREKUM3z4lrLq/view?usp=sharing">April 2024 email</a> to Carlos Franco, an editor at <em>Antibiotics</em>.</p>



<p>Writing under the alias “Carex ternaria” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2AB633BE8B28635C58A2C1E3D2A5E">on PubPeer</a>, Koch pointed out the paper contains several “tortured phrases” in the introduction. As we’ve reported in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/24/google-ai-engineer-withdraws-arxiv-preprint-tortured-phrases-genai/">previous cases</a>, tortured phrases often indicate the use of AI and can occur when large language models try to find synonyms for common phrases. Koch wrote that an LLM had probably replaced “sustainability” with “long-term viability” and &#8220;mechanistic insights” with “visual percepts into processes [of a chemical reaction].”</p>



<p>In his email to the journal, Koch said the “numerous obvious mistakes” in the figures of the paper “likely represent the greatest novelty and originality to be found in the whole manuscript.” Koch also told Franco he found three instances of potential plagiarism in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to Koch’s concerns, an April 2024 <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E2AB633BE8B28635C58A2C1E3D2A5E">comment on PubPeer</a> by “Desmococcus antarctica” pointed out irrelevant and incorrect references in the paper. </p>



<p>Quazi did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp; Koch provided a LinkedIn correspondence between the two from last March in which Quazi said some of the structures Koch critiqued “were made by a third party, as my chemistry colleague dropped out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have no idea how to use that software to make reactions,” Quazi continued in his March 19 message to Koch. After Koch followed up a few days later, Quazi said he planned to correct the issues. Koch later asked Quazi, “What about the plagiarism?” and never heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Quazi’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameer-quazi-81628811a/">LinkedIn page</a> states he is the CEO and founder of GenLab Biosolutions Private Limited, which Manchester’s statement said is in India. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/GenLab-Biosolutions-100054384376147/">GenLab’s Facebook page</a> has not posted since 2023, and the website domain is defunct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His other retractions include two from MDPI journals. The first, for a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/12/2/256">2023 <em>Biology </em>study</a> which has been cited 16 times, appeared <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/14/6/705">in June</a>. The second <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/17/2754">retraction in August</a> was for a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/22/4824">2022 <em>Nutrients</em> paper</a> cited 13 times. Although the notices don’t cite the university investigation, they state the journal “was unable to verify the identity, contribution, or affiliations of a number of the authors listed in this manuscript, nor could the origins of the study be confirmed” in each case – wording nearly verbatim to the most recent notice from <em>Antibiotics.</em></p>



<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oYWw4zlmqiZsSS4ONYsKH03U40E5fSnUvrlrgzaqcvs/edit?usp=sharing">six other papers</a> retracted this year appeared in Springer Nature’s <em>Medical Oncology </em>in 2022-2023<em>.</em> The notices for each of the articles cite the university investigation. One 2022 paper on AI in genomic medicine, which Quazi is the sole author on, has been cited 165 times.</p>



<p>The notices for the articles by Quazi alone also say the journal “reviewed this article and discovered instances of nonsensical or incorrect statements, raising questions about both the authorship and validity of the content presented.” In all cases, Quazi did not respond to questions by the journal, according to the notices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quazi has published 17 articles. Of the six that have not yet been retracted, three <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11033-022-07147-0">come</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12032-022-01702-2">from</a> Springer Nature journals, including one from Springer Nature’s <em>Nanoscale Research Letters</em> — <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s11671-021-03628-6">coauthored by Gavas in 2021</a> — that has been cited over 600 times. Michael Stacey, head of communications for journals at Springer Nature, confirmed the publisher is looking into these papers. </p>



<p>Aside from the retractions in 2025, Quazi received <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/30/former-student-was-running-a-paper-mill-says-university-of-manchester/">two retractions last year</a> from Frontiers journals, one for “serious breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics.”</p>

<p><a href="https://geologia.ufpr.br/administracao/recuros-humanos/dr-carlos-conforti-ferreira-guedes/">Carlos Conforti Ferreira Guedes</a>, a geology professor at the Federal University of Paraná in Brazil, came across a paper in the <em>Journal of South American Earth Sciences </em>earlier this year with irrelevant, and in some cases nonexistent, references.</p>



<p>Made-up citations can indicate the <a href="https://osf.io/5vknq">use of generative AI</a> in crafting the paper – but another detail caught his attention as particularly odd: The researchers on the paper, a study on the transformation of the Brazilian coastline, all listed affiliations in India. Guedes reached out to one of the editors-in-chief of the journal at the time, Andres Folguera, on March 10 to notify the journal about the issues. </p>



<p>As Guedes and his colleagues noted in a <a href="https://www.abequa.org.br/alerta-de-integridade-cientifica-referencias-inexistentes-em-artigo-sobre-a-costa-do-parana/">May 19 blog post</a> on the Brazilian Association for Quaternary Studies (ABEQUA) website, “there were no citations of work conducted in Brazil or by researchers who had previously worked in the region.”</p>



<span id="more-132986"></span>



<p>According to the August 3 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981124003845?via%3Dihub">retraction notice</a>, the authors “were asked to comment upon the presence of these references in their work and acknowledged that the references were not correct.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.vishnu.edu.in/my_profile.php?eid=VIT0611">Phani Babu K</a>, the corresponding author on the paper and assistant professor at Vishnu Institute of Technology in Bhimavaram, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal recently <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981125004353">changed its editorial board</a>, which Monica Heilbron, one of the journal’s two editors-in-chief, told Guedes may have contributed to why it took five months to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guedes and his colleagues also looked at other articles in the journal for similar problems and found <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/JSAES-Flagged-Papers.pdf">11 papers</a> with authorship issues, citation concerns and signs of potential data fabrication. He raised the concerns with the journal on August 6, according to emails we have seen. </p>



<p>Rebecca Clear, a communications director from Elsevier, confirmed <em>JSAES</em> “became aware of some concerns” and told us an investigation “is underway.” The editors-in-chief did not respond to our request for comment regarding the peer review process or post-publication spot checks.</p>



<p>Among those Guedes brought to the attention of the journal is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981124002104?via%3Dihub">2024 paper</a> on urban sprawl in Vila Velha, a city in Brazil. The article has “existing citations that are unrelated to the text” and “nonsense regional references,” Guedes told us. The references include urban dynamics papers for Italy, India and Ethiopia, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guedes&nbsp; told us several of the papers show “invented geology” or “fabricated” data. He said two of the figures in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2024.105272">a January paper</a> — figures 4 and 3 — had “fabricated rainfall data.” He also pointed out a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981124002116?via%3Dihub">September 2024 paper</a>, in which authors claimed João Pessoa, a city in Brazil, had experienced erosion and elevation gains of “tens of meters over a decade,” which he described as “unrealistic results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the authors on the papers were from universities in Saudi Arabia and India, including 14 from universities <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/10/bibliometrics-universities-publication-metrics-authorship/">researchers identified</a> this January for anomalous citation metrics, including King Saud University in Riyadh and King Khalid University in Abha, Saudi Arabia. Only <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981124005534?via%3Dihub">one paper</a> listed two researchers from the same university. And all except one list a researcher with affiliations at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, also in Riyadh and also on the list for anomalous metrics. There are 97 retracted papers in the Retraction Watch Database that include authors from that university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Clarivate’s Web of Science, <em>JSAES</em> has increased its annual article output in the last 10 years, publishing 149 papers in 2015 to a high of 692 in 2021 to more than 400 in the last three years. The journal has published over 300 articles so far this year.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/09/suicide-prevention-awareness-month/">Suicide Prevention Awareness Month </a></h4>

              
                <p>In a recent post on <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2025/09/29/the-death-of-the-lgbtq-suicide-prevention-line/?informz=1&amp;nbd=&amp;nbd_source=informz">Scholarly Kitchen</a>, three writers shared personal stories expressing concern over the White House&rsquo;s decision to eliminate federal funding for the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline&rsquo;s LGBTQ+ youth services, effective on Wednesday.&nbsp; As a nonprofit organization committed to advancing open science and fostering inclusive, equitable access to knowledge, we applaud their efforts to bring attention to this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This specialized service has provided life-saving support to over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people since its inception in 2022. Its closure comes at a time when LGBTQ+ youth face disproportionately high rates of suicidal ideation and mental health challenges, often exacerbated by discrimination, stigma, and lack of culturally competent care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We stand firmly behind the principles of openness, inclusion, and equity&mdash;values that are foundational to our mission. We believe that science and public health must serve all communities, especially those most vulnerable. The decision to defund LGBTQ+-specific crisis services undermines evidence-based public health policy and disregards the urgent needs of a population at elevated risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are committed to publishing and promoting research that informs compassionate, inclusive, and scientifically sound health interventions. Below is a list of studies from PLOS journals, specific to this topic, and a list of resources that LGBTQ+ people can access if they need help (these resources were mentioned in the Scholarly Kitchen post).&nbsp;</p>
