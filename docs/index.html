                The oceans have produced a rare coincidence of the Pacific and Atlantic Niñas, which will lessen the severity of the hurricane season—though 2024 still remains a highly active year.

                <p>This coming <strong>Monday, September 2nd, 2024</strong>, the arXiv team will be observing Labor Day, a federal holiday in the United States. This holiday will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This brief change will only affect the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As our team celebrates Labor Day, announcements will be slightly deferred.</p>
<p>As you plan your submissions to arXiv this week, please be aware of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday, September 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Friday, August 30, 2024, and before 14:00ET Tuesday September 3, 2024 will be announced on Tuesday, September 3, 2024 at 20:00ET.</li>
<li><strong>September arXiv IDs. </strong>September arXiv IDs will be assigned to articles submitted in September at or after 14:00ET Tuesday, September 3, 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>To stay up to date on arXiv news and changes to the announcement schedule, subscribe to <a href="http://blog.arxiv.org/">the arXiv blog</a> or follow us on social (<a href="https://twitter.com/arxiv">Twitter/X</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arxiv">LinkedIn</a>) for timely updates.</p>

<p>A researcher who posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ssad_kth-mdu-academicmisconduct-activity-7201577707405549569-vceW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">LinkedIn</a> about a paper that plagiarized his work says he’s now the subject of an email campaign making false allegations about his articles.</p>



<p>In July, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/04/elsevier-withdraws-plagiarized-paper-after-original-author-calls-journal-out-on-linkedin/">we reported</a> that <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/sasansad">Sasan Sadrizadeh</a>, researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, had his work plagiarized in a now-retracted paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In what seems to be a <em>direct</em> response to our efforts,” as Sadrizadeh wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7227692500075851776/">recent LinkedIn post</a>, his bosses, colleagues, and journals have been <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSude_1xigUrMInbxWBh8Aggn6Qije6Y8nbv3s45tNk/edit?usp=sharing">inundated with emails</a> from impostors, accusing Sadrizadeh of misuse of funds and calling for the removal of his articles. At least one journal editor seems to have taken the allegations seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129919"></span>



<p>Sadrizadeh’s case is reminiscent of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/04/cyberstalking-pits-harvard-professor-against-pubpeer/">2023 cyberstalking</a> of Harvard Medical School professor Joseph Loscalzo on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone impersonating <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hamacher-thomas">Thomas Hamacher</a>, a researcher and professor at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, emailed several journal editors-in-chief in July, claiming to speak on behalf of the German Energy Agency (dena). However, the domain the email came from, “dena-de.net,” is registered to a Squarespace account that was created in June, according to the <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domain=dena-de.net">WHOIS domain database</a>, while the official email domain of dena is dena.de.net.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one instance, the false Hamacher sent an email to the editors of several journals, including <em>Building and Environment Journal</em> and <em>Total Environment Journal, </em>alleging Sadrizadeh had failed to disclose funding from dena for the research described in the publications. The emails accused Sadrizadeh of “misappropriation” of funds and “serious ethical misconduct.” They then request the “immediate withdrawal” of the article and “a pause on the review of publication of any pending submissions” by Sadrizadeh. “Relevant officials” from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology were copied, including the president, Anders Söderholm, and several vice presidents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bin Chen, an assistant editor at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-cleaner-production"><em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em></a>, where Sadrizadeh has at least <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624015804">two</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622051095">papers</a> published, reached out to Sadrizadeh after receiving an identical email from the Hamacher impostor. Chen asked for a “prompt and full response within two weeks” and said he would also consider informing the research institution and funding agency that supported the research. “Please note that if we do not have an adequate and timely response, we may be forced to conclude that the allegations are truthful,” he said.</p>



<p>After Sadrizadeh responded, informing the editor that the emails were spam, Chen told him the journal “understand[s] the case now” and that Chen would inform the other editors.</p>



<p>Sadrizadeh told us that he does not receive funding from dena. The grant number cited in the impostor emails was “DEA 2024.315.4H.”</p>



<p>Fiona Vonnemann, a member of dena’s legal council, told Retraction Watch she “cannot confirm” if the grant “even exists” and said it was “likely fabricated.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">On July 30, the Hamacher impostor sent an email to KTH President Anders Söderholm, telling him “a lawsuit has been filed against him by the German Energy Agency.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadrizadeh said he sent Hamacher an email letting him know that he was being impersonated. Sadrizadeh said the two then spoke on the phone and that Hamacher is aware of the problem. Hamacher did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Vonnemann confirmed “the sender’s email address is not ours” in an email sent to Sadrizadeh. She also said “there is little we can do in this situation, as these actions do not constitute a criminal offense.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Vonnemann confirmed that the emails are not affiliated with dena. “The statements in these emails do not in any way reflect views of dena. They appear to be spam emails,” she told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An unnamed representative of dena in a different email said they had contacted the dena IT department, and asked for Squarespace correspondence from Sadrizadeh “so i [sic] can look into pressing charges.” However, Vonnemann said in an email the “only action we are taking (from a legal standpoint) is to prevent the misuse of an email address that mimics ours.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadrizadeh sent Squarespace an email requesting an investigation into the domain and for Squarespace to reveal the people behind it. A representative responded, saying they “take reports like this very seriously, and we actively keep track of them.” The domain no longer works and it isn’t available online. Emails we sent to the address that contacted the journals bounced back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Squarespace did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone using another email account purporting to be that of <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/fariborz-haghighat.html">Fariborz Haghighat</a>, a researcher at Concordia University, sent an email to several KTH faculty members, including Sadrizadeh, with the subject line “No place for energy engineering &lt;brainfarts&gt; in scientific literature.” The email contained only a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Amirmohammad+Behzadi">link to the PubPeer page</a> for the PhD student mentioned in our original post, Amirmohammad Behzadi. Many of his papers have PubPeer comments accusing Behzadi of over-citing his own work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Haghighat did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Although Sadrizadeh told us he believes the comments are another attempt to discredit him and Behzadi, some of the PubPeer comments date from <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6D48C768CFC4F77E86EFEE461C9BC5">December 2023</a>, months before he went public with his plagiarism charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the comments contain similar critiques of unnecessary self-citation. In one, on the paper “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319921016347?via%3Dihub">4E analysis of efficient waste heat recovery from SOFC using APC: An effort to reach maximum efficiency and minimum emission through an application of grey wolf optimization</a>,” user “Tricorynus dichrous” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4E23292792C0503E58042596FBFADC">commented</a>, “fundamental terms don’t need to be cited with any source because they are direct explanations of the first and second law of thermodynamics,” but the paper had cited previous work of Behzadi and his colleagues for these equations. If any citations were necessary, the authors should have used a primary source such as a book, Tricorynus wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Behzadi declined to comment on these allegations, but Sadrizadeh told us he thought they were “false” and referred us to Behzadi’s <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57201652822">SCOPUS profile</a>, which Sadrizadeh said shows only 8% of Behzadi’s citations are self-citations. Clarivate’s Web of Science shows the same percentage of self-citations.</p>



<p>Sadrizadeh said self-citation is “not only common but also often necessary to demonstrate the continuity and development of their research” and that failure to do so would make it “challenging to trace the evolution of their research and the cumulative knowledge they have contributed to the field.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his LinkedIn post about the emails, Sadrizadeh also said those who commented on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ssad_kth-mdu-academicmisconduct-activity-7201577707405549569-vceW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">previous LinkedIn post</a> calling out the plagiarism of his paper received emails accusing him of misconduct, as the journals had. Ola Eriksson, a professor at the University of Gävle in Gävle, Sweden, who had commented on the first post, replied that he had a “strong suspicion” the email he received was “bogus.”</p>



<p>Sadreizadeh told us the apparent retaliation against him felt like “organized crime. If you even go against these kind of people, they do whatever they can to stop you.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two Dutch researchers were preparing a review of preclinical animal models for hemorrhagic stroke last July when they stumbled across a disturbing pattern in the literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, they found many more papers on the topic than the 50 or so they expected based on their experience: more than 600.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, nearly every study proposed a different intervention, which was “very unusual,” said René Aquarius, a neurosurgery researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. “Why would you show a very beneficial effect and then say, ‘let’s do something else?’”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129907"></span>



<p>Aquarius and his colleague, Kim Wever, an assistant professor in the department of anesthesiology, pain and palliative medicine at the same institute, didn’t have experience with scientific sleuthing. But they recently had seen <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/elisabeth-bik/">Elisabeth Bik</a> speak about image manipulation, and her experience inspired them to dig deeper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pair decided to collect images of Western blots from a random sample of the papers, project them on a meeting room wall, and gather two biomedical students to help with the detective work. Within a few minutes of scrolling through the images, Wever recalls someone exclaiming, “Hey, I think I saw that one before!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers’ investigation revealed unexpected overlaps between data in three papers of a neurosurgical group in Taiwan. They kept digging, and found problems in a total of 24 of the group’s papers which reused the same data while purporting to show different experimental conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One article at a time, Aquarius and Wever pieced together their findings, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22aij+lie+kwan%22">posted them on PubPeer</a>, and contacted the journal editors. Their efforts so far have led to nine retractions and two corrections. But the problems in the field extend far beyond this one group in Taiwan, they say.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In each of Aquarius’ posts on PubPeer, he states he “noticed a considerable overlap between figures published in different studies.” So far, an author has responded to <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8B12E9D4BF6121C2E76AF61040CBAD">only one of his posts.&nbsp; </a>Chih-Zen Chang of the Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan claimed the figures are “original” and apologized for not being able to offer the original films since they “were spoiled in a damaged box.” Chang did not respond to requests for comment from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chang frequently appears as a co-author of Aij-Lie Kwan, a neurosurgeon at the same institute and the former president of the International College of Surgeons. Kwan did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All nine of the retractions posted so far note that the authors did not respond to correspondence from the journal. In contrast, they seem to have offered responses regarding articles that now have corrections. <a href="https://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/abstract/2017/05000/hyperglycemia_aggravates_cerebral_vasospasm_after.28.aspx#errata">In one correction</a>, the journal wrote “the error stems from a misclassification in the authors’ computer folder,” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4877462/">In another</a>, the authors claim to have “mistakenly used the same Western blot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the retracted papers linked to Aij-Lie Kwan are:&nbsp;</p>

</ol>



<p>Aquarius described his experience with journal editors and ethics teams as “hit or miss.” He said some are “very dismissive and say, well, I don’t see a problem.” One journal declined to take further action on a paper after relying “in good faith upon the authors&#8217; representations,” according to Aquarius’ post <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/396AEC52D03A285971D90B526186B2">on PubPeer</a> about the journal’s response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also noted the inconsistency of the journals’ decision making. The same set of data led to a retraction of one paper, but resulted in a correction for another. “It’s super weird to me that a publisher comes to a different conclusion based on the same type of evidence,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other publishers were helpful and immediately started investigating, Aquarius said. One journal, <em>Acta Neurochirurgica</em>, which published six of the now-retracted articles, declared the editor-in-chief “no longer has confidence in the presented data” because of duplications and other errors with the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wever and Aquarius said they see the problems and flag them, but leave the judgment for the journals. “Whether the problem is an honest mistake or sloppy science or even worse, scientific misconduct,that&#8217;s not up to us to decide,” Aquarius said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 600 papers found by the pair suggest there is extensive research into potential treatments for early brain injury. However, “it just gives a completely false idea of the research field,” according to Wever. For Aquarius, he hears firsthand about the consequences of hemorrhagic stroke from patients in a clinical study, and stresses that “errors in the scientific record need to be resolved.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their analysis so far has revealed no common denominator for the problematic articles. “It’s all over the world, all different types of universities,” Aquarius said. “From top universities to not very known universities… from the top journals to the worst.”</p>

RNA-seq has become an indispensable tool for understanding gene expression regulation, discovering novel transcripts, and elucidating alternative splicing events. Additionally, RNA-seq plays a crucial role in the study of diseases, allowing researchers to identify disease-associated gene expression patterns, uncover dysregulated pathways, and discover potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets, thereby advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and aiding in the development of precision medicine.</span></p>

<p>One in four papers on research involving scanning electron microscopy (SEM) misidentifies the specific instrument that was used, raising suspicions of misconduct, according to a new study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/4wqcr">published</a> August 27 as <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/4wqcr">a preprint</a> on the Open Science Framework , examined SEM images in more than 1 million studies published by 50 materials science and engineering journals since 2010.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers found only 8,515 articles published the figure captions and the image’s metadata banners, both of which are needed to determine whether the correct microscope is listed in papers. Metadata banners usually contain important information about the experiments conducted, including the operating voltage of the microscope and the instrument’s model and parameters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of these papers, 2,400 (28%) listed the wrong microscope manufacturer or model, raising questions about the integrity of the conducted research.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129909"></span>



<p>“This is a very weird mistake to make,” says study coauthor <a href="https://amaral.northwestern.edu/people/richardson/publications-by-date/">Reese Richardson</a>, a doctoral candidate at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “It’s like if you wrote all of your code in your manuscript in <em>R</em> and then you said we used Python for all software development.”</p>



<p>For Richardson, there are telltale signs that suggest many of the images in question originate from the same source. For instance, captions in many different papers refer to using a Czech Hitachi instrument even though Hitachi is a Japanese company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a sort of bizarre mistake,” Richardson said. “Yet it shows up repeatedly with the same author present on all of these articles. So this is just an instance where the author is reusing text over and over and over again.” What’s more, in many of these papers, the authors used an instrument from Tescan, not Hitachi, Richardson said, referring to two major manufacturers of the devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The levels of misreporting the study found are “genuinely concerning,” said Angus Wilkinson, a materials scientist at the University of Oxford, in the U.K., and a <a href="https://cen.acs.org/people/Materials-scientist-explains-why-he-started-commenting-PubPeer/102/web/2024/06">part-time scientific sleuth</a>, who was not involved with the new analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, articles with no authors in common nonetheless contained identical typos in the section describing the microscopes the researchers used. “It is pretty clear that these articles were generated or were synthesized at scale without regard for the actual results or the quality of the articles,” Wilkinson added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many papers also misidentified figures as originating from “Amirkabir,” Richardson pointed out, yet none of the authors was affiliated with Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. “So it seems very likely that someone at Amirkabir University is just leasing out these images to be used by other people,” he said.</p>



<p>For many of the articles with the odd mistakes, Richardson and his team began to suspect misidentified microscopes were a sign of a manuscript originating from <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">paper mills</a>, which typically churn out bogus or plagiarized papers and sell author slots on them in exchange for a fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wilkinson agreed: “The majority of these cases probably are either poor-quality articles at best where that attention to detail has been lacking or indeed are fingerprints of paper mills.”</p>



<p>It’s technically possible researchers had more than one microscope in the lab and named the wrong one by mistake, noted Nick Wise, a fluid dynamics researcher at the University of Cambridge, in the U.K., whose sleuthing work has resulted in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">hundreds of retractions</a>. But Wise also thinks a significant proportion of the 2,400 studies could be researchers blindly reusing figures that aren’t theirs. “It’s a symptom of academic fraud,” he said.</p>



<p>A key limitation of the study is its reliance on authors themselves revealing what instruments they used in figure captions and not cropping out relevant image metadata, Richardson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But he doesn’t blame journals for the missing image metadata, as editors generally have cropped these out, often to make sure papers fit in print. This practice changed recently when the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR principles</a> for scientific data were established, and Richardson said journals now play an important role in ensuring full documentation of image metadata.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers found only 43 of the 2,400 suspect papers had been flagged on PubPeer for other issues such as duplicated images, manipulated data and hand-painted graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richardson said he believes many more of the papers would have ended up on the online forum if someone had scoured through them or run them through AI tools like <a href="https://imagetwin.ai/">ImageTwin</a> that can identify integrity issues in figures of scientific manuscripts.</p>



<p>According to Richardson, some authors in the study sample made identical mistakes in the figure captions across several different studies. The most productive authors, who published hundreds of studies since 2010, got the SEM wrong 20% to 50% of the time, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The most prolific author that made this mistake in their articles had done it more than three dozen times and they tended to publish very frequently in the same journals,” Richardson added, “as many as 16 times in the same journal in the same publication year, and a lot of these articles of theirs had already been flagged on PubPeer for other data integrity issues.”</p>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">It was fantastic to see the huge amount of thought-provoking questions for our panel at our ARUK24 workshop, ‘Tackling gender gaps in dementia research’. We were not able to address all of your questions on the day, however, we have reached out to our panellists, as well as other WiNUK members, to answer the questions that we missed. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/52ec89_384bc6087ea149f5b778adf237686b03~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Our incredible panellists!"></figure>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you comment on the pressure to move around? I have been told that staying in the same place is a career killer, but I have family commitments so cannot move.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One of the questions posed to our panellists revolved around the pressure to relocate for career advancement. Fiona shared her perspective, saying, &quot;I personally did not feel any pressure to move, but I did move a lot for exciting opportunities. I think there are pros and cons to moving or staying. I think the best thing is to focus on your goals and try to avoid making comparisons to others. Take (or chase) the opportunities that excite you and motivate you to get up in the morning and work hard. Your success is driven by your output and your growing experience, which you can apply to your role as it expands, and that doesn’t rely directly on location but is a combination of effort, hard work, commitment, grit, riding the wave, soaking up broad learnings and some luck.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam reflected on her experience of feeling pressured to relocate in order to achieve academic independence. She recounted, &quot;Ten years ago, I was coming to the end of my PhD and I applied for a fellowship to be able to stay in the department where I was working. When my application was rejected, one of the reasons given was that I wasn’t moving to another lab. I was warned that it could happen, but it just didn’t seem rational to me. I felt like if I had everything set up to make the project a success, and I had a support network already established to enable me to be successful, why should I have to move to a place where things might be done differently and I wouldn’t know anyone?&quot; Kam continued, &quot;The rationale was that I wouldn’t be able to establish independence whilst still working closely with my PhD supervisor, and I ended up moving to three different cities in the UK with successive postdoc positions. This wouldn’t have been possible if I had financial or family commitments, and I would have had to leave academia through circumstance rather than choice.”</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">However, she has noticed some improvements in this area. She explained, “I don’t think that the pressure to move is as prevalent as it was 10 years ago, as I see more and more ECRs (early career researchers) staying for postdocs and fellowships in the same institution where they have done their PhDs. So I think we are seeing positive changes in attitude regarding this.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Maternity/caring responsibilities are a big barrier, but what about women-specific illnesses such as endometriosis, which can severely impact the ability to work?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Fiona highlighted the diverse challenges individuals face in their careers and the need for systemic improvements to create a more inclusive environment. Fiona emphasised, &quot;We all face different challenges at different times. Chronic illnesses are really tough and probably require individual considerations within the context of the role. By increasing awareness of each of our individual challenges, we can work to improve the systemic infrastructure to support us and our needs and create a more inclusive environment.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">She further stressed the importance of focusing on personal goals and seeking support, saying, &quot;I think you have to focus on what you can do and who can support you in achieving your goals, and also support others with theirs.&quot; We resonate with Fiona&apos;s insights, calling for a heightened awareness of individual circumstances and a collective compassionate effort to address these obstacles effectively to help even the playing field on wellbeing and productivity in research.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What do you think of women in senior roles who display internalised misogyny? How can we stop ECRs from thinking that to succeed they need to be the same?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When asked about the issue of internalised misogyny among women in senior roles, Fiona offered a nuanced perspective. Fiona cautioned against stereotyping specific styles, acknowledging that responses can be influenced by various factors and may not always reflect intentional bias, but that does not mean it never happens. ‘’We have all experienced examples of direct or indirect misogynistic, or other unacceptable, behaviour and I personally find it easier to have a strategy to try to manage it and focus on outcomes rather than let it get to me, but that isn’t always easy’’. She explained, &quot;I think we have to be aware that every individual has a different style and any stereotyping of specific styles can be unproductive, as a response that seems one way could be situational or unintentional, or misinterpreted.&quot; </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">She highlighted the importance of focusing on your personal response to behaviour rather than necessarily overthinking the behaviour itself, emphasising the need to focus on what one can control. Fiona shared, &quot;A mentor gave me some very good advice: that you can only control yourself and how you respond in situations and you have to focus your energy on the things you </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">can </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">control, which can include how you respond to someone else’s behaviour.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Additionally, Fiona stated, &quot;I try to focus on assuming good intent and leading by example, treating others as I would like to be treated, with the goal of creating a work culture where we support each other and lift each other up where we are able.&quot; </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">At WiNUK, we believe that addressing misogynistic behaviours from people of all genders is important for fostering an inclusive and supportive work environment. Internalised misogyny is defined as sexist behaviour towards women </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">by </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">women, which can include mistrusting themselves and other women, and showing gender bias in favour of men. To prevent early career researchers (ECRs) from adopting similar behaviours, it is essential to promote awareness and education about the impacts of misogyny on women. We recommend mentorship and training offerings that emphasise empathy, respect, and collaboration to help ECRs develop healthier leadership styles. Additionally, organisations should implement policies that encourage feedback and open dialogue about workplace behaviours, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. By creating a culture of mutual support and understanding, we can help neuroscientists to realise that success does not require perpetuation of negative behaviours, and it instead can come from inclusive practices. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Do you think that a lot of the differences between women at student and group leader level could be due to historical bias against women, rather than current bias?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite the relatively equal percentage of female and male undergraduates in STEM, and more females successfully completing their degrees, just 25% of professors are female (Joyce et al., 2024). When asked whether the differences between women at the student and group leader levels could be attributed more to historical bias than current bias, Fiona reflected on the interplay of both factors. She stated, &quot;There is a lot of research confirming that there are specific barriers we experience as women. I do think bias is still playing a big role and most women in leadership I talk to have had to take a lot on their shoulders on their way up. Behaviours like assertiveness, taking balanced risks, or being ambitious/hungry can be viewed negatively in women, whereas a man would be viewed positively for the same trait.” Additionally, Fiona shared, &quot;The more responsibility and decision-making I’ve had in my roles, the more I have experienced stereotypes I thought were only in textbooks on historical biases, but I do think this is changing as we have more awareness and also more diverse teams generally sitting with us in the room.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">She also pointed out that biases extend beyond the workplace, adding, &quot;The biases can be at home as well as work, such as the judging comments we receive when we travel for business, that our male counterparts do not experience so much.&quot; </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Women continue to experience systemic challenges which can include insufficient funding, lack of female role models and visibility, harassment and, often, a greater workload at home. Despite this, Fiona did highlight the positive shift that is taking place, with more women now entering higher positions, indicating progress toward reducing these biases.</span></span></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">How do you answer people that are surprised by these statistics and say they do not see any problem for women in neuroscience?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When asked how she responds to individuals surprised by statistics indicating gender disparities in neuroscience, Fiona shared her initial reaction of speechlessness. She elaborated, &quot;What can you say other than point out that they may actually sit at the root of the problem? A lot of people say this as they are lucky to be completely naïve, or don’t want to address their own biases or admit there is any problem. Until someone has walked in your shoes, it is hard sometimes to see. I remember the first time someone did a very stereotypical behaviour in a meeting—I was floored as I thought those days were gone, but sadly, as I’ve become more senior in my roles, I have experienced it more. But we are going to change it!&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam suggested a direct approach to addressing scepticism about gender disparities, emphasising the importance of acknowledging and analysing data. Kam indicated that individuals who disregard data to fit their biases may undermine the scientific process: “I would suggest that if they took the same approach and ignored data within their scientific field to fit their biases, they really shouldn’t be doing science.” This highlights the need to acknowledge statistics, even if we do not like what they say. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Have you asked women about their reason for leaving science?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When asked if she had inquired about women&apos;s reasons for leaving science, Fiona shared, &quot;Yes – many leave as they want to do different things. Others leave due to a personal experience at work, or to go to new opportunities that fit their interests or home lives better. There isn’t a single reason normally.&quot; Fiona emphasised the diverse factors influencing individual decisions, noting that the absence of a singular reason underscores the variety of personal and professional motivations. A key reason appears to be personal experience at work, which can include instances of gender bias and sexism, but this is often part of a diverse range of factors.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Many of you are talking about alliance building. Have experiences of gender disparities fed into how you approach partnership and influencing?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Fiona provided insights into how gender disparities have shaped her approach to partnership and influencing strategies. She explained, &quot;Sometimes you need to prepare for a meeting by getting some of the stakeholders on your side in advance to avoid surprises. If you aren’t being heard, it can be good to work with another colleague who makes sure your voice is amplified in meetings, for example.&quot; </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite the challenges, Fiona highlighted her focus on future interactions and learning from past experiences, adding, &quot;Generally, I try not to focus on gender or other characteristics. If I have a bad interaction, I try to let it go and focus on the outcomes I need to achieve and the future. I also try to look back and evaluate whether I might have handled the situation differently if it happened again, so I can ensure I capture the learnings.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #a5698a;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">All three of you have specifically mentioned a man who has championed you and your career. What can we do as men to be those champions?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">When asked about how men can champion women in science, Fiona emphasised the importance of equitable treatment and support in overcoming imposter syndrome. She stated, &quot;Treat us equitably and help us overcome any doubts quickly. We all experience the occasional but debilitating bout of imposter syndrome, which is hard to avoid, and we need to be reminded we can do it in that moment. Most champions help us to see our best selves. I’m so lucky to have had many great and diverse mentors in my career, and from broad perspectives in science and other industries.&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Kam highlighted that gender bias affects everyone, not just women, and urged men to actively mentor female early career researchers (ECRs). She explained, &quot;Gender bias is not a woman’s issue, it’s everyone’s issue because we’re all diminished if we lose good neuroscientists due to the challenges women continue to face. I would encourage men to be good mentors by ensuring they provide support for female ECRs. For example, suggest conferences they can go to and present at, advise them on how to get published, have early discussions about the next steps in their career, and share your network with them. They should show as much interest in their ECRs&apos; career development as they do in the data they are generating for the lab. Reflecting on her own experiences with male mentors, Kam underscored the necessity for all PIs to prioritise mentorship in supporting women in science. She shared, &quot;All my PIs have been men and have provided me with mentorship throughout my career. These are things PIs should be doing anyway, but through my work with ECRs, I’m consistently finding they’re not.&quot; Kam&apos;s insights emphasise the practical steps men can take to champion women and the ongoing need for dedicated mentorship in academia.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The insights shared by Fiona and Kam shed light on the importance of addressing gender disparities and fostering inclusivity in the scientific community. Their perspectives underscore the need for collective action to support women in science and create equitable opportunities for all researchers. By championing diversity, promoting mentorship, and advocating for systemic change, we can work towards a future where every individual, regardless of gender, has an equal opportunity to thrive and contribute to scientific progress.</span></span></p>

<p>In June of last year, Salvador Pineda received an email from a researcher at Zhejiang University in China informing him one of his articles had been plagiarized. </p>



<p>The researcher pointed Pineda to a paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014206152100418X?via%3Dihub">A robust optimization method for optimizing day-ahead operation of the electric vehicles aggregator</a>,” which appeared in Elsevier’s <em>International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems</em> in November 2021. The article, by researchers at the University of Lahore, Pakistan, contained several figures copied from Pineda’s 2020 paper “<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9122589">An efficient robust approach to the day-ahead operation of an aggregator of electric vehicles</a>,” as well as similar text.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uma.es/departamento-de-ingenieria-electrica/info/113635/salvador-pineda-morente/">Pineda</a>, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Málaga in Spain, immediately wrote to the journal’s editor-in-chief, who said he’d retract the article, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Yet the article remains intact, more than a year later, with the publisher blaming the delay on staffing changes at the journal.</p>



<span id="more-129880"></span>



<p>“We are feeling extremely frustrated and cannot understand why it is taking so long to retract such a clear case of plagiarism,” Pineda told us.</p>



<p>A week after Pineda’s email, Vladimir Terzija, editor-in-chief of the <em>International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,</em> told Pineda and several other researchers the journal would retract three papers for plagiarizing their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The corresponding author of the plagiarized papers accepted his mistake and expressed a strong apology, promising that something like that will never happen in future [sic],” Terzija wrote in emails we have seen. Terzija declined our request for comment.</p>



<p>Ubaid ur Rehman, the corresponding author mentioned by Terzija, last year lost <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dur%2bRehman%252c%2bUbaid">two papers </a>for plagiarism in a Springer journal. “As other plagiarized authors have informed me, papers in other journals [by ur Rehman] were retracted immediately” after the editors received concerns, Pineda said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other papers Terzija promised to retract as well as Pineda’s are &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061522001326">A robust vehicle to grid aggregation framework for electric vehicles charging cost minimization and for smart grid regulation</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061521005974">Optimal power management framework for smart homes using electric vehicles and energy storage</a>&#8221; All three articles remain intact in the journal.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In June, one year after Terzija promised the retractions, Pineda <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7208434135948763136/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7208434135948763136%2C7208515850205569024%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287208515850205569024%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7208434135948763136%29">posted on LinkedIn</a> asking fellow researchers for advice on the unresolved situation. Following that post, ur Rehman emailed Pineda to say he had also requested retraction of the paper and was unaware of the “many plagiarism rules.”</p>



<p>“As a young and immature member of the academic community I would like to ask you to please delete this post, I accept that I made mistake [sic] and I ensure you I have a deep regret on this thing, however your LinkedIn post is highlighting this matter on social media which is highly damaging for me,” ur Rehman told Pineda. Ur Rehman did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>“We are aware of these papers and the retraction process is indeed underway,” a spokesperson for Elsevier said, adding, “journal staffing developments presented some delays.”</p>



<p>We’ve previously covered many cases of journals taking a while to act, including a bioinformatics journal that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/02/one-year-later-bioinformatics-journal-with-unclear-leadership-yet-to-retract-plagiarized-article/">failed to retract an article</a> following a year of requests from the aggrieved author and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/03/two-years-ago-an-author-asked-a-journal-to-withdraw-a-paper-it-still-hasnt/">a 2020 request for retraction</a> over falsified data. Both of those papers still have not been retracted.</p>



<p>“It is deeply disappointing to see that some scientific journals disregard both the integrity of science and the efforts of those who contribute honestly to the field,” Pineda said.</p>

<p>Sage has retracted 467 articles from the <em>Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems</em>, a title it took on when it <a href="https://group.sagepub.com/press-releases/sage-grows-research-portfolio-by-acquiring-ios-press?_gl=1*1ol2wiz*_gcl_au*Mzc3MDgzNTM5LjE3MjQzMjE2OTg.*_ga*MTg4Mjc2NDY3MS4xNjQ5MTUxMTc3*_ga_60R758KFDG*MTcyNDMyMTY5OC4yMjUuMC4xNzI0MzIxNjk4LjYwLjAuMA..&amp;format=amp">acquired IOS Press</a> last November for an undisclosed sum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher “launched a thorough investigation” into the journal in April, according to a spokesperson, after the indexing company Clarivate “informed us about concerns relating to the quality of some of the journal’s content.”</p>



<p>“The investigation found that the peer review process for some articles was inadequate, leading to the retraction of these articles,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal’s editor in chief, <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/langari-reza.html">Reza Langari of Texas A&amp;M</a> University in College Station, resigned on June 16 “due to differences of opinion on how to proceed” with Sage’s investigation, he told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129899"></span>



<p>In Langari’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Langari-comment.pdf">comments to us</a>, he said submissions had grown significantly in recent years because of growth in the AI field, which the journal covers, reaching 10,000 last year. The journal implemented a prescreening process and rejected over 80% of submissions, he said, “some of which were clearly manufactured by paper mills or else using AI tools.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Time pressure and lack of responses from reviewers sometimes shifted decisions about manuscripts to associate editors, Langari said. When he didn’t trust an editor, “I would summarily remove them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He speculates complaints from editors he removed or “disgruntled authors” he’d placed on an “internal blacklist” of nearly 1,000, or the large number of submissions to the journal, may have contributed to Clarivate flagging the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Langari called Sage’s decision to retract over 450 articles “presumably due to short review periods or limited reviews,” a “rather drastic measure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The decision to remove so many papers from my perspective may not have been entirely warranted,” Langari said. He was not involved in the final decision. “I do appreciate the fact that they did not unduly blame myself, the editorial board and the authors in their retraction notices,” he said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Sage paused publication of new articles in the journal when it began investigating, and will continue the pause while moving the management of the journal in-house, according to the spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>At Sage, we believe in the power of the academic record and the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/31/guest-post-a-look-behind-the-scenes-of-bulk-retractions-from-sage/">importance of taking corrective action</a>, when necessary, as we work to hold all our journals to high quality standards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal’s profile page on Clarivate’s website states indexing for the title in Web of Science is “on hold” while the company re-evaluates its content “according to our selection criteria.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Clarivate removes the journal from Web of Science, the company will no longer index its papers, count their citations, or give the title an impact factor, which makes it a less attractive venue for researchers to publish their work. Universities and other institutions use metrics about citations, as counted by indexes such as Web of Science, in hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions, meaning researchers who previously published in the journal also may <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">pay a price</a>.</p>



<p>Clarivate did not give the journal an impact factor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/30/ten-journals-denied-2020-impact-factors-because-of-excessive-self-citation-or-citation-stacking/">in 2020</a> over concerns about “citation stacking,” also known as participating in “citation cartels” or “citation rings.” In 2021, IOS Press <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/14/publisher-retracts-nearly-80-articles-over-three-days/">retracted nearly 50 articles</a> from the journal for citing “literature sources that have no relation to the subject matter of the citing article,” according to the <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219218">notice</a>. (Langari acknowledged this episode as one “mishap” in his 21-year tenure as editor in chief, which he said involved “special issues guest edited by presumably trustworthy individuals.” Afterwards, the journal focused on regular submissions and stopped producing special issues “unless done under our control.”)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage was aware of issues with the journal before acquiring IOS Press, the publisher’s spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For any new journal we take on, we use our resources to make sure we’re publishing at a high standard and in accordance with COPE. If there are any issues with specific journals then we’ll take corrective action as needed.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-intelligent-and-fuzzy-systems/ifs219433">retraction notice</a> for the articles cites “inadequate” peer review, and states, “we have no evidence to suggest authors were involved.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Publisher acknowledges the anonymous volunteers on PubPeer whose observations complemented our internal investigation,” the notice states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PubPeer user “Rhipidura albiventris” commented on several of the now-retracted papers to point out <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/18B36861E90E10465F1191F1A84D85#2">flaws in the calculations</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/46E62E22CE258B29DF0EDC469E5342">question the relevance of citations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Even more papers have been flagged via the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1::::::">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, a project of sleuth <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> which uses various detectors to spot bad practices in academic papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Cabanac, the PPS has identified 11 articles in the journal with <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:24::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:%5CJournal%20of%20Intelligent%20%26%20Fuzzy%20Systems%5C">tortured phrases</a>, nonstandard wording of common phrases that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">seem to be written by computers</a>. None of these flagged papers appears in today’s retraction notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PPS “Feet of Clay” detector, which identifies articles that cite retracted work, has flagged <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:%5CJournal%20of%20Intelligent%20%26%20Fuzzy%20Systems%5C">674 papers</a> in the journal, not all of which have been retracted in this batch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s retractions “will feed the Feet of Clay even more,” Cabanac told Retraction Watch, once the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31">detector</a>, which uses the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch Database</a>, now part of Crossref, receives information about them from the metadata providers. “We&#8217;ll need to assess the domino effect.”</p>



<p>“Chain retractions” may be necessary if authors referenced the now-retracted papers with the “‘<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6605F48422547546E0F5DA03E028A5">citation plantation</a>’ technique,” Cabanac said, referring to <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24896">over-citation</a> of particular authors, even for unrelated topics. “I&#8217;m curious to see which journals will be ‘contaminated’ the most…”</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="986" height="417" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129847" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5.png 986w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5-300x127.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5-768x325.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">via <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/193997#!/">Cureus</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The journal <em>Cureus </em>retracted an article for plagiarized images after questioning the motives of the researcher who said her images were taken.</p>



<p>The researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, first emailed <em>Cureus,</em> an open-access journal <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/springer-nature-acquires-cureus/23793592">Springer Nature acquired</a> in 2022, on August 1. She said she noticed images in the October 2023 paper, “<a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/193997#!/">Pediatric Acute Dacryocystitis and Orbital Cellulitis With Concurrent COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report</a>,” came from a lecture she posted online and later removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The images used in this article were edited and presented under a fabricated clinical scenario” and had been used without her permission, the researcher wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch. She requested the journal retract the article. She also provided what she said were her original images, which were replicated in Figure 1 of the paper, and copied the corresponding author of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129846"></span>



<p>That author, <a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/602975-ahmed-a-abdelaziz">Ahmed A. Abdelaziz</a>, of&nbsp; Dallah Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, responded and said the researcher’s allegation was correct. First author <a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/602982-saleh-h-ghulaysi">Saleh Ghulaysi</a> (often spelled “Ghulaisi” by colleagues), a medical student at Jazan University in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, was “unable to provide an answer regarding the source of the image,” Abdelaziz wrote. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I had reviewed the materials provided by Saleh and trusted that they were legitimate. However, it is now evident that Saleh not only failed to provide accurate and verifiable information but also intentionally misled the co-authors and myself. Given the severity of Saleh&#8217;s misconduct, I believe the case report should be retracted, and all authors, including myself, should be held accountable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ghulaysi disputed that he was responsible for the image. “All my research project have been peer reviewed and answered correctly and conducted ethically,” he told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/147558-prateek-s-harne">Prateek Harne</a>, an associate editor at <em>Cureus</em>, said in an email reply to the anonymous researcher on August 4 the “images are copied.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The paper should be retracted, and the authors should be flagged,” Harne wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/5">Graham Parker</a>, director of publishing at <em>Cureus</em>, told the researcher the journal’s investigation would take four to six weeks. In emails we received, the researcher questioned this timeframe, asking if six weeks was “really needed just to check that the published images are identical to the ones I sent you, and to confirm that they only replaced the color annotations?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am not sure I understand your demand for urgent action?” John Adler, the editor-in-chief of the journal, told the researcher in an email. He said her “efforts to go around our process, and to apply added pressure both puzzles and even concerns me that there might be another secondary agenda at play.” He urged her to “sit back and let our process play out over the next 1-2 weeks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a follow-up email, the researcher said she was copying us on the thread and “hoping that you act more seriously with scientific fraud.” Parker called the statement “insulting and offensive to the efforts of our small staff.” He then said: “you do not have the journal&#8217;s permission to share any communications with them,” referring to our organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we reached out to Parker, on August 14, he emailed the researcher and said he considered her actions to be a “breach in confidentiality” and “it may in fact constitute a violation of copyright law for which you could be help [sic] legally liable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Cureus</em> <a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/193997-pediatric-acute-dacryocystitis-and-orbital-cellulitis-with-concurrent-covid-19-infection-a-case-report/retraction#!/">retracted</a> the article the same day, citing images that were “plagiarized from an online lecture” and the authors’ inability to “verify authenticity of the patient data upon request.”</p>



<p>On August 15, Parker responded to our email saying the journal was “investigating this case carefully and have now retracted the paper due to plagiarism and concerns regarding the authenticity of the case data.”</p>

<p>A journal that lost its impact factor in June is in the midst of a cleanup operation, issuing nearly 140 retractions so far this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass retractions began over a year after sleuths <a href="https://thebulletin.org/biography/alexander-magazinov/">Alexander Magazinov</a> and <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a> first raised concerns about the presence of suspicious citations, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">tortured phrases</a> and undisclosed use of AI in the journal’s articles. </p>



<p>Cabanac and Magazinov have now flagged <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:3::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:Environmental%20Science%20and%20Pollution%20Research">1,850 articles</a> from the journal, Springer Nature’s <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>(<em>ESPR</em>)<em>,</em> with the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1::::::">Problematic Paper Screener, which </a>looks for evidence of bad practices in academic papers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129849"></span>



<p><a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:Environmental%20Science%20and%20Pollution%20Research">Most of the flagged articles</a> ran afoul of the “Feet of Clay” detector, which looks for articles that cite retracted material. The <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:31">detector</a> makes use of the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a>, which is now part of Crossref.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 100 papers contained <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:24::::RIR:IREQ_VENUE:Environmental%20Science%20and%20Pollution%20Research">tortured language</a>, nonstandard phrases which are sometimes the result of a rewriting extension called <a href="https://spinbot.com/">SpinBot</a>, Cabanac told us. Cabanac said the “tortured phrases” label applies only to articles with five or more occurrences to avoid false positives. “This means that a lot of <em>ESPR </em>articles are not shown,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the March 2019 paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-019-04752-8">Environmental factors affecting the frequency of road traffic accidents: a case study of sub-urban area of Pakistan</a>” states “3000 individuals kick the bucket” from road traffic accidents, rather than saying “people die,” Cabanac <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BEC3AE440265F8853400FA3556D702?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">pointed out</a> on PubPeer. The authors also used the phrases “monetary misfortunes” instead of “financial damages” and “creating nations” in place of “developing countries.” The paper was retracted in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mnsuam.edu.pk/index.php/f-members-d-a">Hafiz Mohkum Hammad</a>, the corresponding author on the article and a researcher at Muhammad Nawaz Shareef University of Agriculture in Punjab, Pakistan, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other papers seem to have been drafted with undisclosed use of AI, as was the case for the September 2023 paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-29672-6">Revitalizing our earth: unleashing the power of green energy in soil remediation for a sustainable future</a>.” Section 3 of the paper ends in the phrase “Regenerate response,” a button in ChatGPT that generates text, as we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/06/signs-of-undeclared-chatgpt-use-in-papers-mounting/">previously reported</a>. “Did the authors copy-paste the output of ChatGPT and include the button&#8217;s label by mistake?” Cabanac asked in his <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/83DCF77815DC61C4ED6DCD88847EC4?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer comment</a> calling out the mistake. The paper was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-34165-1">retracted</a> in July, but the notice does not mention undisclosed AI use as a reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding author of the paper, Kangyan Li, did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In November 2022, Magazinov contacted the journal’s editor-in-chief, <a href="https://www.ism.u-bordeaux.fr/actualites/dr-philippe-garrigues">Philippe Garrigues</a>, a CNRS researcher based in Bordeaux, France. He called out <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.365">a paper</a> published in a different journal for which “more than a quarter of its total” citations came from <em>ESPR.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Should we suspect that referees or editors of Environmental Science and Pollution Research engage in citation extortion? Please check. No doubt your journal needs a major cleanup,” Magazinov said in the email.</p>



<p>In a follow-up email to Garrigues the next day, Cabanac introduced himself, and said the “issues Dr. Magazinov sent are really concerning; I believe they should be taken seriously.”</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/06/signs-of-undeclared-chatgpt-use-in-papers-mounting/">As previously reported</a> by Retraction Watch, Garrigues assured Cabanac the journal was taking action. “This is not over,” he wrote in French.</p>



<p>In April 2023, after no further responses from Garrigues or the journal, Cabanac alerted the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> (COPE) about “20+ papers with tortured phrases” in the publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An officer from COPE emailed the journal and Springer Nature to ask if the journal was looking into the matter, and what the current status of the follow-up was.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/tim-kersjes/16338950">Tim Kersjes</a>, a research integrity advisor for Springer Nature, responded, saying the “journal and the publisher are still investigating and reviewing the matter as part of a larger investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kersjes also said the publisher would inform Cabanac “once we have made a determination for postpublication corrective action.” That was the last Cabanac heard from the journal, although COPE followed up several times in June 2023, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit frustrating when you’re pouring so many efforts in pro bono and you don’t even get feedback from the publisher,” Cabanac told us.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Since February 2024, the journal has retracted 136 papers by our count. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-34599-7">most recent retraction</a> came August 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/chris-graf/16338700">Chris Graf</a>, research integrity director at Springer Nature, told us the retractions “are the result of ongoing investigations by our research integrity unit, which have also been informed by concerns raised externally.” He also said the papers were retracted for a variety of reasons, and “the use of LLMs [large language models] has not been identified in all cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identical <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-34165-1">retraction notices</a> have been issued for many of the articles:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An investigation by the publisher found a number of articles, including this one, with a number of concerns, including but not limited to compromised peer review process, inappropriate or irrelevant references, containing nonstandard phrases or not being in scope of the journal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Clarivate, which calculates impact factors for journals based on citations to papers, did not give <em>ESPR </em>an updated version of the closely watched metric this year. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">At the time</a>, a representative for Springer Nature said they were “disappointed” by that decision and would investigate Clarivate’s concerns regarding the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is currently marked as “on hold” on the Clarivate website, which says “[c]oncerns have been raised about the quality of the content published in this journal” and that it is being “re-evaluated” and could be removed from the Web of Science index altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert Mendelsohn, the editor-in-chief of the <em>Climate Change Economics,</em> blamed “too many citations” from <em>ESPR </em>for the suppression of his journal’s impact factor.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://group.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/new-research-integrity-tools-using-ai/27200740">Springer Nature recently announced plans to use</a> AI tools to detect AI-generated content and problematic images. When we asked about these tools, Cabanac said he’d be “happier” if the publishers would “hire more research integrity staff and trained them properly,” and if editorial board members were “picked more carefully.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graf also told us Springer Nature was “updating the Editors and Editorial Board” of the journal “to ensure a focus on research integrity and robust manuscript handling, and instituting a stricter special issue protocol, supported by our research integrity unit.”</p>



<p>Cabanac said he thought journals undergoing investigation should at least post a disclosure statement to warn researchers who plan on submitting to the journal. Without such a statement, he said, “most potential authors won&#8217;t know about the journal&#8217;s history and they are entitled to feel misled.”</p>
