                Researchers believe they have discovered oxygen being produced 4,000 meters below the sea surface, and think polymetallic nodules—the sought-after bounty of deep-sea miners—could be the source.

<p>A political scientist in Canada copied his postdoc’s work without credit in a paper, according to the retraction notice and a university inquiry report<em>.</em></p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00307270231201871">paper</a> by <a href="https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/political-science/people-in-the-department/charles-conteh/">Charles Conteh</a>, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, appeared in Sage’s <em>Outlook on Agriculture</em> in October 2023. It has one citation, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>An inquiry by Brock identified plagiarism and uncredited authorship in the article, according to the report finalized this March and seen by Retraction Watch. Failure to give post-doctoral fellows the “opportunity to publish in peer-reviewed journals negatively impacts [them] both reputationally and financially,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129719"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://brocku.ca/esrc/about-us/people/">Amy Lemay</a>, now a science analyst and founder at VISTA Science &amp; Technology Inc., was Conteh’s postdoctoral fellow from August 2020 to January 2023.</p>



<p>In emails seen by Retraction Watch, Conteh asked Lemay and another faculty member for feedback in March 2023, on a draft of the article they were writing. After reviewing their feedback, Conteh said he could no longer proceed with the project, citing “serious reservations” about Lemay’s suggestions to publish separate papers based on <a href="https://niagaraknowledgeexchange.com/economic-prosperity/growing-agri-innovation-investigating-the-barriers-and-drivers-to-the-adoption-of-automation-and-robotics-in-ontarios-agriculture-sector/">policy reports</a> they had produced for Niagara’s Community Observatory platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can (and most likely will) cite them in future papers, but I object to the idea of us reproducing and republishing them in their current forms,” Conteh wrote in an email seen by Retraction Watch. “I plan to revisit this project at a future date, but at this point, after some reflection, what I can candidly say is that I am not clear about a collaborative way forward.”</p>



<p>Months later, Lemay discovered the published paper online by accident. The article used text from the policy briefs she had worked on, without citing those sources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When it finally sunk in, I was angry (outraged, really) and felt betrayed,” Lemay told Retraction Watch. “I took a couple of days to calm down and think through my options for responding. I knew what Dr. Conteh had done was wrong. I felt that I was in a unique position to call it out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lemay asked Conteh to add her as a co-author to the paper. In October, Conteh asked a journal editor if the authorship could be updated to include Lemay and another co-author&#8217;s name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conteh replied he was “glad that you&#8217;ve suddenly taken an interest in being a co-author in the manuscript now that it has been published. I am adding your name not because I think you deserve it or are entitled to it, but because it is the noble thing to do.”</p>



<p>In November, <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/author/jillian-lenne">Jillian Lenne</a>, an editor at <em>Outlook on Agriculture</em>,<em> </em>said it was too late to update the authorship as the paper was already accepted. Lemay then requested Sage retract the paper for misrepresented authorship and copying previous publications without citation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to Lemay’s request for retraction, Conteh wrote in the email she “has no basis for claiming co-authorship or requesting retraction of a paper she did not write.” Conteh said Lemay’s acknowledgment in the manuscript as a postdoc should have been sufficient. “By the logic of Amy&#8217;s claim to authorship, all research assistants I&#8217;ve hired to help me on a project should claim co-authorship whenever I publish an article that draws from a data source they helped me collect or analyze,” he wrote.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Lemay said she finds Conteh’s views on authorship troublesome and that she was responsible for the majority of the research. “This view about what constitutes co-authorship contradicts one of the most fundamental and canonical academic principles,” she said. “That it is an attitude that may be held by other faculty is a serious concern that needs to be addressed to protect graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.”</p>



<p>The article was retracted in May, with the following notice:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Due to the unattributed text which calls into question the author contributions in this article, the Journal Editor has retracted this article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Conteh, who disagreed with the retraction, told Retraction Watch he has no further comment beyond reiterating he was the principal investigator of the project and the retracted article came from that project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lemay said the citations listed in the retraction are incorrect because they credit Conteh as the lead author when it should be her. A spokesperson for Sage said they are working to correct the citations.</p>



<p>Though she recently finished a postdoc, Lemay worked in academia for 25 years before pursuing her PhD. At this point in her career, she said, she is not intimidated by the “power imbalance” in academia, as some younger students who are still forging a career path may be.</p>

                <p>Predictive processing is one of the most influential ideas from computational neuroscience for the experimental neurosciences. However, definitions of predictive processing vary broadly, to the extent that &#8220;predictive coding&#8221; is used sometimes in a very narrow sense (there are specific cell types for negative or positive expectation errors) or in a very broad sense (anything related to error signals or expectation mismatch is predictive processing).</p>



<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qEadPMEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Jerome Lecoq</a> now started the great initiative to write a review about error signals for predictive processing, but in a very collaborative manner. He invited anybody interested to join the writing of the review.</p>

<p>I think that this way of writing a collaborative and open review is a great idea, even though it might be difficult to reconcile all the different opinions! <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-nbAIGfEMysqPjCi4bqyUkp6c2hDet_cGKl8q5nfRM/edit">This link</a> will lead you to the Google document with the main text and with the instructions on how to contribute. And if you don&#8217;t feel like you want to contribute, it is at least a useful opportunity to learn about the current opinions in the field and how people agree or disagree about the interpretation of predictive coding, error signals and the literature that covers both. Take a look!</p>

<p>Elsevier is investigating the journal <em>Geoscience Frontiers</em> after a PubPeer thread flagged an editorial advisor whose articles in the journal were edited by his frequent co-authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/geoscience-frontiers/about/editorial-board">editorial advisor</a>, <a href="https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/m.santosh">M. Santosh</a>, is a professor at the University of Adelaide in Australia and a “Highly Cited Researcher” with more than 1,500 published articles, <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/B-2563-2012">according to Clarivate’s Web of Science</a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0631B15B8773EAA02B76D3AC34B3DB">PubPeer commenter</a>, “Desmococcus antarctica,” noted that two associate editors of the journal, <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/news/EditorialBoarddetails/422.htm">Vinod O. Samuel</a> of Yonsei University in Seoul and <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/news/419">Erath Shaji</a> of the University of Kerala in Thiruvananthapuram, India,&nbsp; are often listed as “Handling Editors” of Santosh’s articles published in <em>Geoscience Frontiers — </em>despite each frequently publishing other work with him.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129716"></span>



<p>A representative from Elsevier told us the publisher was looking into the matter, adding that “we expect our publishing partners to uphold our publishing policies, including the proper conduct of peer-review.” Elsevier publishes <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/index.htm"><em>Geoscience Frontiers</em></a> on behalf of China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of the researchers have responded to our request for comment, nor has <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/EditorialBoard">Xuanxue Mo</a>, editor-in-chief of the journal and professor at China University of Geosciences (Beijing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samuel edited at least 20 of Santosh’s papers in <em>Geoscience Frontiers </em>from 2017 to 2024, according to the PubPeer post<em>.</em> “Due to the massiveness of the scale on which this happened,” the Pub Peer comment stops at 20 instances, Desmococcus states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samuel and Santosh have co-authored at least 15 papers together in multiple journals, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Shaji edited at least 10 of Santosh’s articles<em> </em>in <em>Geoscience Frontiers </em>from 2017 to 2024. The two were co-authors on at least 29 papers from 2016 to 2023 in different journals, according to Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Desmococcus has flagged many other <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=M.+Santosh+geoscience+frontiers">papers by Santosh in <em>Geoscience Frontiers</em></a> on PubPeer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond <em>Geoscience Frontiers,</em> Desmococcus has chronicled similar instances of Santosh’s frequent co-authors editing his papers at other journals, <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/06/28/schneider-shorts-28-06-2024-a-series-of-improper-erroneous-and-potentially-fraudulent-manipulations/#santosh">as reported</a> by For Better Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one incident, a report from the 5GH Foundation, a China-based “<a href="http://www.5gh.ac.cn/About.html">non-profit organization for promoting science and technology</a>,” <a href="http://www.5gh.org.cn/WuGH/20240603.001.html">alleged</a> Santosh had initially been listed as the handling editor of his own paper at <em>Geoscience Frontiers.</em> The <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/en/article/doi/10.1016/j.gsf.2024.101804">paper</a> now lists <a href="https://appliedgeochemistsindia.org/pdf/Manikyamba.pdf">Chakravadhanula Manikyamba</a>, a researcher at the National Geophysical Research Institute, as handling editor (although her name is misspelled as “Manikyabma”).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manikyamba is another frequent editor of Santosh’s articles in <em>Geoscience Frontiers,</em> as Desmococcus <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0D28D8B0D3BBC66F04FFA6AA832E1F?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">points out</a> on PubPeer. She edited at least four of his papers and has co-authored three papers with him since 2022, according to Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santosh’s record also includes a retraction. In 2020, his paper “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666759220300044">Hydrocarbon reserves of the south China sea: Implications for regional energy security</a>” was removed “because it inadvertently included unlawful content.” The editor-in-chief of the journal where it appeared, <em>Energy Geoscience,</em> did not respond to our request for clarity on what constitutes “unlawful content,” but an Elsevier spokesperson told us that the authors requested the removal “because they had inadvertently breached legal regulations.”</p>



<p>Elsevier’s <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/article-withdrawal">website</a> states it will remove an article only in “extremely limited number of cases,” in which the article is “defamatory, or infringes others’ legal rights, and retraction is not a sufficient remedy.” An article will also be removed if Elsevier “has good reason to expect it will be” the subject of a court order, or if it would pose a “serious health risk” if acted upon.</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7.png"><img decoding="async" width="1021" height="1024" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-1021x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-129700" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-1021x1024.png 1021w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-300x300.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-150x150.png 150w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-768x771.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7.png 1169w" sizes="(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px" /></a></figure>



<p>In an episode reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fake-science-crisis-ai-generated-rat-giant-penis-image-2024-3">AI-generated graphic of a rat</a> with a giant penis, another paper with an anatomically incorrect image has been retracted after it attracted attention on social media. The authors admit using ChatGPT to make the diagram.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2024/07120/assessment_of_the_efficacy_of_alkaline_water_in.91.aspx">retraction notice</a> published July 12, the article, by researchers at Guangdong Provincial Hydroelectric Hospital in Guangzhou, China, was retracted after “concerns were raised over the integrity of the data and an inaccurate figure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, published in Lippincott’s <em>Medicine</em>, purported to describe a randomized controlled trial that found alkaline water could reduce pain and alleviate symptoms of chronic gouty arthritis.</p>



<span id="more-129699"></span>



<p><a href="https://thehealthhammer.wordpress.com/about/">Morgan Pfiffner</a>, a researcher for Examine.com, an online database for nutrition and supplement research, first noticed the study while on vacation and <a href="https://x.com/MorganPfiffner/status/1808586391959326976">posted</a> on X about the erroneous diagram in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I planned to inform the journal when I got back, but that graphic was just too absurd not to share on social media once I saw it,” Pfiffner told Retraction Watch. Another X user found the paper’s introduction to be 100% AI-generated.</p>



<p>Commenters including Elisabeth Bik and Thomas Kesteman <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0662F1D2E21480EB8307A1C2DFDE4D#">chimed in</a> on PubPeer, echoing Pfiffner’s concerns. Bik pointed out that Figure 4 had the wrong number of bones in the lower leg and arm and had nonsensical labels such as &#8220;chlsinkestead atlvs no ctivktty greuedis&#8221; and &#8220;Aliainine jerve sreiter.&#8221; She also noted inconsistencies in the data and seemingly unrealistic methods.</p>



<p>Kesteman highlighted additional issues: Some of the references in the article do not appear in PubMed or Google Scholar, and the authors’ email addresses were not institutional – which, we note, is considered a red flag but not always a sign of problems. Further, the results of some statistical analyses were “virtually impossible,” Kesteman said, and data on pain scores in a table “present patterns that are impossible to find in real life.”</p>



<p>Yong Wu, the corresponding author of the study, told Retraction Watch English is not the team’s first language, and the cost for translation was prohibitively expensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Therefore, our research team has resorted to using AI for text translation and refinement. Similarly, the expense of scientific illustration is beyond our means, which led us to use ChatGPT for generating research diagrams,” Wu said. “We apologize for any controversy this may have caused.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Medicine</em> said the journal is continually improving its editorial review process. “We are working on a number of initiatives to help shape the future of medical research reviews based on collaboration with other leading publishers, dedication to peer reviews and leveraging new technologies,” they said.</p>

<p>Unenlagiine theropods are a group of dinosaurs that are key to understanding how living birds evolved. However, fossils of these dinosaurs are rare, especially from the Late Cretaceous period. Therefore, it has been rather challenging to piece together their evolutionary history and understand the modifications that occurred within the Unenlagiinaen lineage over time.</p>
<p>A recent paper published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> describes the discovery of <em>Diuqin lechiguanae</em> gen. et sp. nov., a new unenlagiine theropod dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous (Santonian) Bajo de la Carpa Formation in Neuquén Province, Argentina. This new taxon, described from an incomplete postcranial skeleton, exhibits unique morphological features, particularly in the humerus, which appears intermediate between older and younger unenlagiines. Phylogenetic analysis places Diuqin within Paraves, with a strong affinity to Unenlagiinae. Interestingly, the humerus bears tooth marks, likely from a crocodyliform, mammal, or another theropod, which offers additional insights into the paleoecology of these theropods and their interactions with other animal species of their time. This finding marks a significant advancement in the field of paleontology, bridging a 15-million-year gap in the unenlagiine fossil record.</p>

<p>Iodine is crucial for producing thyroid hormones and maintaining thyroid gland health, with deficiencies leading to goiter and severe developmental issues, including growth and mental impairments. Historically, Switzerland faced significant iodine deficiency, causing high rates of goiter and cretinism until iodine fortification of salt began in the early 20th century. Despite the success of these programs in reducing goiter prevalence, some cases remain, emphasizing the need to explore additional factors, including genetic predispositions.</p>
<p>To examine the genetic factors contributing to goiter development, despite adequate iodine supplementation, a recent study published in <em>BMC Medical Genomics</em> assessed the feasibility of extracting and analyzing DNA from historical blood spots found in medical records of patients with iodine deficiency-induced goiter and thyroid cancer between 1929 and 1989 in Switzerland. The researchers found that DNA yields varied significantly between samples, with many showing substantial degradation and mixtures of DNA from different contributors. The study concludes that each sample must be individually evaluated for genetic analysis, and larger or entire blood ablations should be collected to mitigate insufficient DNA quantities.</p>
<p>The impact of this advance is significant for historical epidemiology and genetic research, as it allows for the exploration of genetic predispositions in populations from past decades, potentially leading to a better understanding of disease causes and the development of targeted interventions.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-13665 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/green-ammonia-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/green-ammonia-300x201.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/green-ammonia.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The production of conventional fertilizers, such as ammonium nitrate, significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation due to energy-intensive processes and the release of nitrous oxide. In contrast, green ammonia production, which uses renewable energy sources for hydrogen generation, tries to reduce carbon footprints and environmental impact, thereby offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional methods.</p>
<p>A recent Comment article published in <em>BMC Environmental Science</em>, takes a close look at the term &#8220;green ammonia,&#8221; especially in areas with limited water resources. The authors point out that while green ammonia is produced using green hydrogen (which comes from water split using renewable energy) and does cut down on carbon emissions, it still has other serious environmental effects. These include a high demand for fresh water and potential ecological harm from desalination.</p>
<p>The authors argue that the fertiliser industry should use a wider perspective on environmental impact, focusing not only on carbon emissions but also on reducing the flow of reactive nitrogen and phosphorus. They suggest that recycling human waste and other organic materials could be a better and more sustainable option than green ammonia. This approach could greatly cut down on carbon emissions and nutrient pollution.</p>

<p>Ocean acidification, caused by increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels, which leads to higher concentrations of carbonic acid in seawater, significant effects the marine ecosystem. As we are facing increasingly adverse climatic parameters, understanding how animals respond to future environmental conditions is crucial for predicting their adaptability and survival.</p>
<p>In a recent study published in <em>BMC Genomics,</em> Thomas et al. investigated the neurobiological effects of ocean acidification (OA) on the two-toned pygmy squid (<em>Idiosepius pygmaeus</em>). By using a <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assembly approach, the authors assessed transcriptomic alterations in the squid&#8217;s central nervous system (CNS) and eyes under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions and correlated molecular changes with varying CO<sub>2</sub> levels and behavioral modifications.</p>
<p>Their findings indicate that OA triggers transcriptomic responses related to neurotransmission, neuroplasticity, immune function, and oxidative stress. These molecular changes were also associated with changes in behavior (e.g. increased activity levels and changes in visually guided interactions), suggesting a mechanistic link between environmental changes and behavioral responses.</p>

Tetris, a popular computer game, may offer a novel method for reducing PTSS by minimizing intrusive memories associated with trauma. This review aims to evaluate the potential of Tetris as an intervention for preterm parents, exploring its feasibility and effectiveness in mitigating PTSS within this vulnerable population.</p>
<p>A study published in <em>BMC Digital Health</em> investigated the potential application of the computer game “Tetris” as an initial intervention to alleviate post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in parents of preterm infants within Neonatal Units (NNUs). In their scoping review of 13 relevant articles, Craig et al. identified four recurring themes: memory consolidation, the impact of Tetris on intrusive memories (IMs), its neurological effects, and its feasibility in clinical trials.</p>
<p>The review shows that playing Tetris can interfere with the consolidation of traumatic memories, thereby reducing the frequency and intensity of disturbing memories. Additionally, the game is deemed both acceptable and feasible for clinical implementation, suggesting it could serve as a beneficial tool for preterm parents in mitigating PTSS.</p>

<p>A 14-year-old paper has earned an expression of concern after an anonymous whistleblower found evidence of image duplication in the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors have had images from several more papers flagged on PubPeer. The corresponding author, <a href="https://louisville.edu/medicine/cancer-research/kellymcmasters">Kelly McMasters</a>, is chair of the Hiram C. Polk, Jr., MD Department of Surgery at the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2010 paper, “<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.25322">Adenovirus-mediated expression of truncated E2F-1 suppresses tumor growth in vitro and in vivo</a>,” appeared in <em>Cancer. </em>It has been cited 12 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129677"></span>



<p>The <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.35435">expression of concern</a> highlights “suspected duplication of elements between figures 2b and 2c.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The author [sic] admitted mistakes were made during preparation of the figures; however, since the paper was published in 2010, they were unable to provide the original raw data for figure 2c. Although the conclusions are not believed to be affected, the journal is issuing this expression of concern to alert readers that blots in figure 2c were inappropriately modified without disclosing the processing in the figure caption.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>McMasters did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Carissa Gilman, director of editorial operations for <em>Cancer</em>, told<em> Retraction Watch</em> an “anonymous whistleblower” raised concerns about the paper by email. The person “said they had been aided by ImageTwin, an image integrity analytical tool,” Gilman told us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the inappropriate image modification, Gilman told us the editors did “not believe we have enough evidence that the paper should be retracted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal uses expressions of concern “if there are issues we believe cannot be resolved,” the representative continued. “In this case, since the original blot cannot be found, we cannot satisfactorily resolve this issue.”</p>



<p>A January 2024&nbsp; <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4EEA9BC0C130587E0FA581BD040D60?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">comment</a> in PubPeer from “Actinopolyspora biskrensis” on the 2010 paper points out possible duplications of signals and gel slices in the figures mentioned in the notice, as well as possible differential splicing between gel lanes.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The lead author, <a href="https://medicine.missouri.edu/faculty/jorge-gomez-gutierrez-phd">Jorge Gomez-Gutierrez</a>, an associate professor at the University of Missouri School of Medicine in Columbia, Missouri, was unable to find the original blots “given the age of the paper,” according to Gilman.</p>



<p>Gomez-Gutierrez “agreed that the bands corresponding to actin were inadvertently duplicated during the figure preparation,” but stands by the paper “since they have been able to reproduce the same results in the intervening years multiple times using different cell lines,” according to Gilman.&nbsp;He did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>McMasters has several other papers with PubPeer comments, including a second 2010 paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209007326?via%3Dihub">Developing adenoviral vectors encoding therapeutic genes toxic to host cells: Comparing binary and single-inducible vectors expressing truncated E2F-1</a>.” Actinopolyspora <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/69CE43F4F9F070F8B9D36630521758#1">pointed out</a> image overlap in figure 3C of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gomez-Gutierrez <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/69CE43F4F9F070F8B9D36630521758#">responded</a> on PubPeer with original images. However, a second commenter, “Nerita vitiensis,” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/69CE43F4F9F070F8B9D36630521758#3">created an animation</a> which “only confirms that <em>Actinopolyspora biskrensis</em> was correct – the images do indeed overlap.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212004448?via%3Dihub">second paper</a> in <em>Virology </em>has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/402E118A80645EC794FBD424DAE494">comments on PubPeer</a> pointing out image issues. Actinopolyspora noted in January that “[t]wo images in Figure 6D seem to overlap, but are described differently.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A spokesperson from Elsevier, the publisher of <em>Virology,</em> has confirmed that<strong> </strong>the papers in <em>Virology </em>with PubPeer comments are currently “under investigation.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April, the MDPI journal <em>Cancers</em> issued a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/7/1432">correction</a> for “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/10/5/144">Temozolomide Enhances Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Virotherapy In Vitro</a>,” a 2018 paper for which Gomez-Gutierrez and McMasters are corresponding authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The correction concerns an “error” in figure 1A of the paper, again following a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/67FAA6D7E18ACD49BFBE21FCD3332F?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer comment</a> from Actinopolyspora. According to the correction, “the image of a crystal violet plate of MDA-MB-231 cells was inadvertently duplicated from a previous manuscript,” but a “new set of experiments was performed to replace the duplicated crystal violet plate and generate a new quantification graph.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another <em>Cancers</em> article by McMasters and Gomez-Gutierrez has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C3F66E9F852BDCDBD32DFE3FE376E2?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">PubPeer comments</a> regarding potential image manipulation. MDPI didn’t respond to our request for comment about any plans to investigate further.</p>

                <p>A Frontiers journal has taken down the abstract of a “provisionally accepted” article about harms from an herbal supplement after the company that sells the products sued the first author for defamation.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dr.-Cyriac-Abby-Philips.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="230" height="300" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dr.-Cyriac-Abby-Philips-230x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-121117" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dr.-Cyriac-Abby-Philips-230x300.jpg 230w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dr.-Cyriac-Abby-Philips-768x1000.jpg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dr.-Cyriac-Abby-Philips.jpg 774w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cyriac Abby Philips</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The author of the paper, <a href="https://www.rajagirihospital.com/Doctor-Profile/Dr.-Cyriac-Abby-Philips">Cyriac Abby Philips</a>, a hepatologist at Rajagiri Hospital in Kerala, India, has over 266,000 followers on his X account “<a href="https://x.com/theliverdr">TheLiverDoc</a>.” In 2020, another of Philips’ papers about harm from supplements was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/22/after-legal-threats-from-herbalife-elsevier-journal-retracts-and-then-removes-a-paper/">retracted and removed</a> after the large supplement company Herbalife, whose products the paper impugned, put legal pressure on Elsevier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Himalaya Wellness, an herbal supplement company which says its products are based on Ayurvedic practices, last year sued Philips for defamation based on his posts on X about the company’s products.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129671"></span>



<p>X <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2023/Sep/29/x-account-of-hepatologist-the-liver-doc-suspended-after-himalaya-obtainsex-parte-injunction-2619366.html">suspended his account</a> following a court order that also barred Philips from speaking about Himalaya or its products. After Philips appealed the order and said he would hide the X posts at issue, a higher court ordered the social media platform to <a href="https://thewire.in/law/karnataka-hc-orders-suspended-the-liver-doc-x-account-to-be-restored-after-hiding-9-tweets">restore his account</a>, but the gag order remains in effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Himalaya filed its lawsuit, Philips had submitted a paper to <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em> describing cases of liver damage linked to one of Himalaya’s products, Liv.52. The journal accepted the article in January and posted it online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after, Philips received an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-3.pdf">email</a> from a research integrity staffer at Frontiers, who wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It has come to our attention that there are ongoing court proceedings involving you and the Himalaya Wellness Company. Alongside this, we have received information suggesting a potential undisclosed financial relationship. As stated in COPE’s guidelines, it is required to highlight any perceived conflicts of interest in a statement. For more information, please see our guidelines here: https://www.frontiersin.org/guidelines/policies-and-publication-ethics#conflicts-of-interest</p>



<p>In order to comply with COPE guidelines, we kindly request your input regarding the potential financial conflict of interest. Additionally, considering the ongoing legal matters, we would like to ask whether it would be preferable for you to halt publication until court proceedings are over?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Philips <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-4.pdf">responded</a> that he had an advisory position with the pharmaceutical company Cipla Limited that lapsed in 2020, and had no other conflicts of interest to report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the legal proceedings, Philips wrote they were “irrelevant” to the publication:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>There is no active legal order from a Court of Law currently in place that precludes Frontiers Journal or the authors from publishing this scientifically accepted peer-reviewed manuscript since the currently ongoing legal proceedings are independent of this publication and the submission, peer-review and final acceptance of the manuscript is independent of current Court proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June, the Frontiers staffer <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-5.pdf">replied</a> the publisher had decided to “place the publication of the article on hold until the legal proceedings in India have been resolved.” The email continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>To explain, based on the information that we have received, we have been advised that publication of the article could already be covered by the current court order, or that the claimant will most likely take measures to this effect. Therefore, until the legal proceedings have been resolved, we will proceed to withdraw your article temporarily from the publication process.</p>



<p>Once the legal proceedings have been concluded, we would of course be happy to reexamine the position. Please kindly keep us informed once the situation has been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Philips and his co-authors subsequently received an automated <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-6.pdf">notification</a> from the <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em> editorial office that their manuscript had been “withdrawn” and “is no longer under consideration for publication in this journal.” The publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Document-10.pdf">refunded</a> the authors’ payment, and removed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240531063856/https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1276313/abstract">abstract</a> from its website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Frontiers confirmed that the journal had “temporarily withdrawn the article from the publication process pending the outcome of the legal proceedings currently taking place in India.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spokesperson continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We have explained this in writing to Dr Philips, who agreed with our decision. We have also informed Dr Philips that we are happy to reexamine this position once the legal proceedings are concluded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A representative from Himalaya told us “the matter is sub judice,” meaning <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/sub-judice">under consideration</a> in court and not supposed to be discussed publicly. “Based on a Court’s direction the paper was withdrawn.”</p>



<p>Philips was not available for comment. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arifhussaintheruvath/?originalSubdomain=in">Arif Hussain Theruvath</a>, a researcher at Rajagiri Hospital and an author on the paper, said Philips “is currently prohibited by Karnataka Civil Court&#8217;s injunction orders from speaking on Himalaya Wellness company or their products, especially Liv.52.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Theruvath, who provided documentation of Frontiers’ correspondence with the authors, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>There was no reason for Frontiers to hold publication or halt further proceedings on a scientifically accepted publication on [in response to] a “soft threat” based on misleading civil suit from the Ayurveda product manufacturer who had no right to extend the gag order towards scientific publications, rather than only Dr. Philips’ social media posts. …</p>



<p>This has been a disappointing decision from a scientific integrity and moral context for science, and medical scientists – that law and legal can be twisted in any manner to silence important scientific findings that have great impact on public health.</p>

<p>As <em>Retraction Watch</em> recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/12/how-a-widely-used-ranking-system-ended-up-with-three-fake-journals-in-its-top-10-philosophy-list/">reported</a>, three of the top 10 philosophy journals in the highly influential Scopus database turned out to be fakes: Not only did these dubious journals manage to infiltrate the list, but they also rose to its top by trading citations. This news is embarrassing in itself, but it is hardly shocking. Our rankings-obsessed academic culture has proven time and again that it is prone to data manipulation. Rankings for both publications and institutions are routinely hacked by scholars, editors, and administrators who are ready to tweak or even falsify numbers as needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problems with the Scopus journal rankings, however, run much deeper. The issue is not that inflated citation numbers have occasionally propelled impostor journals to the top of the list. Rather, at least in my own field of literary studies, the ranking makes no sense whatsoever: the list is full of journals that have no business being there at all because they belong to entirely different areas of scholarly enquiry, and even when the ranking gets the field right, it systematically places marginal publications close to the top. In what follows, I briefly break down the major ways the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=1208">Scopus Literature and Literary Theory</a> Ranking is not just skewed but downright nonsensical.</p>



<span id="more-129655"></span>



<p>Scopus ranks journals based on SJR (SCImago Journal Rank), which it defines as a “measure of journal’s impact, influence or prestige.” The ranking includes a little over 1,000 titles, but for the purposes of this analysis I have focused mostly on the top 100. My main finding: the majority of journals in the upper part of the list quite simply do not belong to the fields of literature and literary theory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The top 10 are particularly telling. Within that group is exactly one (!) journal – an annual publication dedicated to the work of the Spanish Golden Age dramatist Lope de Vega – that&nbsp; specializes in literature. Another two are wide-ranging humanities journals in which literary scholars do publish, although these also are highly idiosyncratic. The first is <em>South Atlantic Quarterly</em>, a long-standing journal dedicated to “urgent political, cultural, and social questions,” whose editorial board consists primarily of literary theorists, and the second is <em>Journal of Cultural Analytics</em>, a relatively new open-access publication “dedicated to the computational study of culture.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rest of the top 10 belong to translation studies (two), criminology (one), and writing studies (two); one is an interdisciplinary journal with a primary focus on sociology and gender studies, and one (<em>Poetics</em>) has been founded as a literary journal in the 1970s and continues to address issues related to literature (among other topics), but it does so from a distinctly sociological perspective. The editors are sociologists, who also make up the bulk of the contributors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short, Scopus’ list of top 10 literature journals includes one journal specializing in literature, two general humanities journals with some footing in literary studies, one journal that used to specialize in literature but no longer does, and six journals with absolutely no relation to literary studies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>RANK</td><td>JOURNAL TITLE&nbsp;</td><td>ACTUAL FIELD</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Translation Spaces</td><td>Translation Studies</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Criminology and Public Policy</td><td>Criminology</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Anuario Lope de Vega</td><td>Literature</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Journal of Writing Research</td><td>Writing studies</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Men and Masculinities</td><td>Sociology</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Perspectives: Studies in Translation Theory and Practice</td><td>Translation Studies</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Poetics</td><td>Sociology of Culture</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Writing Communication</td><td>Writing Studies</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>South Atlantic Quarterly</td><td>Interdisciplinary Humanities</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Journal of Cultural Analytics</td><td>Digital Humanities</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Table 1. Top 10 journals in the Scopus Literature and Literary Theory Ranking</p>



<p>The situation becomes only slightly better when we analyze the top 100. In that cohort the number of journals belonging to the fields of literature and literary theory rises to somewhere between 35 and 45, depending on how one counts. However, even with that improvement, well over half of the titles on the list&nbsp; do not belong there. They belong to a range of different fields, including primarily language and linguistics, but also education, library science, anthropology, history, theology, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What accounts for this failure of most basic classification? One might assume that the creators of the list have simply lumped literature and some adjacent fields together: Although it is deeply frustrating to scholars who share little in terms of publication venues, research methodologies, and departmental affiliations, the use of joint categories that encompass fields like literature, linguistics, and writing is not unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Scopus seems to be doing something different. The database has a separate category for <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=3310">Language and Linguistics</a>, and although&nbsp; some journals may publish in both fields&nbsp; (none of the remotely good ones do), many of those included in the Literature category are in fact <a href="https://benjamins.com/catalog/sic">pure linguistics journals</a>, full stop. Besides, even if overlapping classifications can account for some of these intruders, one cannot justify the presence of journals like <em>Performance Measurement and Metrics </em>or <em>Men and Masculinities </em>on the list.&nbsp; No methodological choice, however dubious, can explain this ranking. One has to assume that those who created it simply couldn’t be bothered to properly attend to the task at hand.</p>



<p>To make things worse, even when we remove the noise created by the inclusion of journals from other fields and focus only on actual literature journals, the ranking’s ability to identify quality publications does not seem to improve. A look at the top 100 journals reveals that publications with no discernable international footprint systematically outrank highly selective world-leading venues. To use just one startling example, Malaysian pay-to-play publication <em>3L: Language, Linguistics, Literature </em>(40th overall) far outranks almost every major literature journal published in the US and Europe, including such cutting-edge publications as <em>PMLA</em> (59th), <em>English Literary History</em> (110th), and <em>Diacritics </em>(415th).</p>



<p>Many other interesting quirks would require further scrutiny, such as the curious overrepresentation of journals published in Slovenian, a language with barely 2 million speakers, as well as the equally curious overrepresentation of journals focusing on the Spanish Golden Age, an important period in early modern literary history, but surely not one that could plausibly attract more high-quality scholarship than the entire fields of German and French literary studies, Comparative Literature, and Medieval Studies, all of which are completely absent from the top 100. And yet, here we are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Scopus ranking under the rubric of “Literature and Literary Theory” is many things but a meaningful ranking of journals in the field of literary studies, it is not. It contains scores of journals that have absolutely nothing to do with that particular field, and it routinely awards very high rankings to publications with no international relevance whatsoever. On what criteria, it is impossible to say. Unsurprisingly, most of the publications that are ranked highly in Scopus are not good enough to be included in Clarivate’s much more selective Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index. Some have made it into the less selective Emerging Sources Citation Index, but most are not picked up by Web of Science at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wish I could offer some more constructive criticism, but such criticism would imply that the Scopus ranking, such as it is, has some redeeming features, which it does not.&nbsp; How do you improve a list that ranks <em>Criminology and Public Policy</em> as one of the top literature journals? That would be like taking seriously a list that treats <em>Shakespeare Quarterly</em> as a top journal in the field of chemical engineering. It would probably be easier to just start from scratch.</p>



<p>Of course, the biggest problem with Scopus is that, despite its profound unseriousness (at least in my field), it is generally taken seriously and produces real-world consequences.&nbsp; A tenure case at a major US research university is unlikely to hinge on a journal’s standing in Scopus, but in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries, administrators routinely rely on Scopus rankings as a proxy measure of research quality. And yet, in its existing form the ranking is not only an utterly inadequate tool for achieving that goal but may well be counterproductive given the sheer number of marginal journals on which it confers the veneer of respectability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know what the situation in the sciences is, but in the humanities, Scopus must get its act together. Until then, its rankings will not be a serious indicator of journal quality.&nbsp;</p>

In 2018, they <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/rna-detection-tool-debate-flares-up-at-acs-meeting--64756">clashed at a meeting</a> of the American Chemical Society, where Mirkin called Lévy a “scientific terrorist.” Lévy has begun an <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7993122">effort to replicate</a> one of Mirkin’s significant papers as part of the <a href="https://nanobubbles.hypotheses.org/">NanoBubbles project</a>, which “focuses on how, when and why science fails to correct itself,” according to its website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Lévy’s <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12746734">letter to <em>PNAS</em></a>, which the journal declined to publish, he wrote Mirkin’s article’s “presentation of SNAs as a ‘powerful class of nanotherapeutics’ is misleading.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>PNAS</em> article had mentioned a clinical trial of an experimental cancer drug from <a href="https://invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/startups/exicure.html">Exicure</a>, a company Mirkin <a href="https://www.invo.northwestern.edu/technologies/invo-spotlights/featured-innovators/chad-mirkin.html">co-founded in 2011</a> to develop SNAs for diagnosing and treating disease, claiming the treatment showed a “33% overall response rate at the highest dosage,” Lévy wrote. He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>No reference is provided but the figure appears to come from an interim report presented by the company (press release and presentation at a conference (<a href="https://jitc.bmj.com/content/8/Suppl_3/A257.2">10</a>)). The 33% are in fact 2 patients from a sub-group of 6 patients.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03684785">clinical trial</a> was stopped for administrative reasons, Lévy noted. Exicure <a href="https://investors.exicuretx.com/news/news-details/2021/Exicure-Inc.-Announces-Results-of-Internal-Investigation-and-Implementation-of-Strategic-Measures-to-Reduce-Cash-Burn-and-Prioritize-Pipeline-Focus/default.aspx">announced</a> in late 2021 it would wind down the trial. At the same time, the company disclosed the results of an internal investigation that found Grant Corbett, the former leader of its neuroscience group, had “misreported” preclinical efficacy data about another experimental drug in public presentations and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to its most recent disclosure, Exicure “has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company” but is now “exploring strategic alternatives” after restructuring and suspending its clinical and development work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lévy’s letter concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Public and private funders of scientific research in academia and start-up companies have to make choices about which biomedical technologies or innovative therapies they sponsor. The scientific literature plays a critical role in informing those decisions and must therefore be balanced and accurate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">One month after Lévy submitted his letter to <em>PNAS</em>, he received an email from Mirkin, seen by Retraction Watch, accusing him of making “factually false and damaging” statements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You will be hearing from my lawyer next week regarding the defamation and the serious legal consequences for it,” Mirkin wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cease and desist letter followed on May 15. Lévy’s communications with <em>PNAS</em>, “falsely disparage [Mirkin] and charge him with having a lack of integrity in his profession as a research scientist,” Mirkin’s lawyer wrote. The letter continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are putting you on notice that in the event you do not retract the false statements made to PNAS and cease to disseminate further false statements of and concerning Dr. Mirkin to any third parties or the public generally, Dr. Mirkin will take all appropriate action to obtain relief against you for resulting injuries to his good name and reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the “patently false and defamatory” statement the letter attributes to Lévy does not appear in his letter in <em>PNAS</em>, and he said he did not write those words. Here’s the quotation from the cease and desist letter:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The published article [authored by Mirkin and others] includes uncited data that is misleading due to its small number of participants and the fact that the clinical trial (NCT03684785) was discontinued due of (sic.) a fraud case which found Mirkin’s previous company (Exicure) liable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Mirkin nor his lawyer, Phillip J. Zisook of the Chicago firm Schoenberg Finkel Beederman Bell Glazer, has responded to our queries about the source of the quotation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The letter also accuses Lévy of wanting “to cause injury to Mirkin’s professional reputation through fabricating and disseminating false statements.” Zisook wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Because your false statements disparage Dr. Mirkin in his professional capacity as a research scientist, they will be found to support actions for defamation per se and false light invasion of privacy in a lawsuit against you.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter is “quite astonishing,” Lévy said, containing false assertions and posing “an extremely serious attack on my academic freedom and on academic freedom in general.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zisook’s letter mentions a research misconduct investigation into Lévy at the University of Liverpool, where he worked until 2020, when he left voluntarily for his current position. The investigation – into allegations Lévy downloaded papers from Sci-Hub and harassed other scientists – was closed after the initial assessment for “insufficient grounds to pursue the complaint,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Likewise, the letter alludes to complaints against Lévy at his current institution. These were retaliatory complaints after he reported a case of scientific misconduct, Lévy said. We’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/31/journal-pulls-papers-by-embattled-scientist-at-national-research-center-in-france/">covered that case</a>, which has resulted in three retractions so far. The investigations against Lévy have concluded without charges, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the letter, Lévy sent Zisook and Mirkin a copy of his submission to <em>PNAS</em> and asked them to withdraw the cease and desist demand, as the quoted sentences “were very different from what I wrote.” It’s unclear where the passage came from. He also wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>​​In my opinion, the correct way to determine whether this letter should be published or not by PNAS is through editorial evaluation including eventually peer review. Most people would certainly agree that legal threats should not interfere with that process…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zisook refused to withdraw the cease and desist demand. He wrote:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It was not just premised upon a particular statement in the article you recently forwarded to me but rather a persistent campaign to selectively use information and misrepresentations to actively defame Dr. Mirkin, including your recent communications with PNAS which clearly left them with the false impressions described in our Cease and Desist Letter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>PNAS</em> rejected Lévy’s letter on June 17. A representative for the journal declined to comment on the decision, “due to the confidential nature of the peer review process.”</p>

<p>A paper finding kids did worse in school following the Flint water crisis is “severely flawed and unreliable,” according to critics who were deeply involved in exposing the crisis.</p>



<p>The paper has now earned an addendum from the authors, but the critics say it should be retracted.</p>



<p>The authors of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4737">article</a> investigated whether the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know">water crisis</a> in Flint – a period when the drinking water in the Michigan city was contaminated with lead – affected the academic capability of children living there. The authors concluded children in Flint did worse in math after the crisis and more needed special education than before the episode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article was published in <em>Science Advances </em>in March and referenced by major news outlets like<em> </em><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/flint-michigan-water-crisis-ten-years-after"><em>ProPublica</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/03/13/flint-children-school-academic-setbacks/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</p>



<span id="more-129627"></span>



<p>Soon after, <a href="https://envsci.rutgers.edu/profiles/Siddhartha_Roy.html">Siddhartha Roy</a>, an assistant professor of environmental science at Rutgers University in New Jersey, and his colleagues sent an email to Holden Thorp, editor in chief of the <em>Science </em>family of journals, expressing <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EA620BE7EDEB55DF0B1581368C2747">concerns about the analysis</a>. In particular, they noted a “confounding” change in the state testing standards at the time of the crisis in Flint that the authors did not account for in their paper. Roy and his colleagues also wrote that the article did not properly acknowledge previous research, and may have lacked the necessary ethical approval. </p>



<p>The article “reinforces false narratives about the nature of the lead exposure and cause(s) of changing educational performance,” they said in the email seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roy and <a href="https://www.webapps.cee.vt.edu/index.php?category=people&amp;pagetype=bio&amp;do=getprofile&amp;user=edwards.html">Marc Edwards</a>, a distinguished professor of environmental engineering at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/19/after-we-tried-to-correct-claims-about-deadly-water-filters-in-flint-we-were-accused-of-scientific-misconduct-and-that-was-just-the-beginning/">helped expose the water crisis</a> by collecting citywide data with residents that showed elevated lead in water and federal Safe Drinking Water Act violations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edwards and Roy’s group advised the editorial team to launch an investigation based on their concerns. “[I]f found to be legitimate,” they wrote, “we ask that the article be retracted. At a minimum, an expression of concern should be appended immediately while an investigation is underway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, Laura Remis, an editor at <em>Science Advances,</em> said the journal had asked the authors to respond to the concerns and requested they submit an addendum to their article with annotated data source and code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the email seen by Retraction Watch, Remis said the authors’ response was sufficient and “we stand behind the conclusions of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to claims the paper was unreliable, the authors wrote they “dispute this in the strongest possible terms.”</p>



<p>The study’s analysis of math and reading achievement was “invalid” as it compared different years of Michigan state testing when the standards changed significantly, Roy’s team said. The state’s department of education noted that the tests introduced in 2015 are “very different” and should not be compared to the prior 2014 standard. In response, the authors said their analysis compares only relative performance on tests and does not rely on raw comparisons of different years of data.</p>



<p>In contrast to other peer-reviewed articles, this study also “fails to contextualize actual blood lead levels in Flint children,” Roy’s team said – an omission which ​​creates an impression that the primary adverse health effect from the crisis was lead exposure, which the data in the article doesn’t support. Remis’email said the <em>Science</em> editor did not find merit in this point, so did not ask the authors to respond to this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, the article “selectively cites and misrepresents evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes” during this crisis, Roy’s team said. The authors said they believe this concern comes from “a misinterpretation of the text.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While we trust this research project must have required [institutional review board] IRB clearance,” Roy’s team said&nbsp; “the specific IRB approval code and authorization agency are not mentioned anywhere in the article or supplementary information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the authors said: “The University of Michigan IRB determined that our study used only deidentified data that could be [sic] linked to specific individuals and was therefore not regulated by the IRB. All personally-identifiable information was handled and access [sic] by Michigan Department of Education and the Center for Educational Performance and Information.&#8221;</p>



<p>Edwards said they would like to request the raw data from the Michigan Department of Education to redo the analysis themselves, but the cost is prohibitive:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We’ve already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars exposing the [water crisis], and have now years of our lives and hundreds of thousands more, debunking crap science papers about the crisis, so we are doing a cost benefit analysis as to whether it is worth spending another $6000 to possibly correct yet another result that is possibly false. The reality is that because it was already been trumpeted in the media, and many powerful people do not want to see it refuted, even if we exposed the result as crap (and the authors admitted it), it would have little effect to correct the record or perception.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://sociology.princeton.edu/people/sam-trejo">Sam Trejo</a>, an assistant professor of sociology at Princeton University, in New Jersey, and lead author of the paper, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our authorship team took Roy’s concerns seriously, and we appreciated the opportunity for engagement with our research. Ultimately, we concluded that the points they raised did not threaten any of the paper&#8217;s findings. Our team provided Science Advances with a detailed response to Roy&#8217;s concerns, and the journal was satisfied with our response. More specifically, the Science Advances editorial staff did not believe it was necessary or appropriate for us to issue a correction or erratum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This month, the authors issued the addendum – published as an “eLetter” at the very bottom of the article page – explaining their analysis of Michigan’s test scores as well as including a “replication package” to allow others to reproduce their analyses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The addendum “is a way of just blowing off our legitimate criticism, allowing the authors to have the last word, without ever giving us the first word, or airing dirty laundry,” Edwards told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am surprised that they are calling it an ‘Addendum’ and not an ‘Erratum’ or even a ‘Correction,’” Roy said. “While I am glad the authors were forced to acknowledge that a statewide test change occurred and coincided with the water switch in Flint, they severely downplay its implications.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edwards said he finds the larger context of this paper fascinating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Research that claims to find something horrible in Flint, seems to get published easily, and is picked up and amplified in the media. Whereas papers that point out problems with those analysis, or shows that the narrative is exaggerated, or might even be harming the people it claims to try and help, has a hard time getting published. The best example of that, is [Roy’s] paper, questioning whether we should continue lying to Flint children, and telling them they were brain damaged by an unprecedented harmful lead exposure event, when all the data shows it never happened. They never stop to think, that the harm of this false story (via a nocebo effect), might overweigh the alleged benefits, for the very people they claim to be helping.</p>
