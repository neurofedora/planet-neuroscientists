<p><strong>Comets, novas and the Mayans </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/archaeoastronomy"><em>Science News</em></a>, June 30, 1973</p>



<p>Did the Mayans record novas and comets? … Comparing dates of known historic novas and comets with [20] Mayan dates, [a researcher] found no acceptable correlation. Nevertheless, [the researcher] believes that the Mayans probably did record such events and that a record will eventually be found.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Solid evidence that ancient Maya people marked dying stars or passing comets continues to elude archaeologists. Several early codices and stones may have recorded hieroglyphs that together mean “comet.” But Spanish conquistadores destroyed many of the originals, and only copies made well after the Maya empire’s collapse clearly depict comets. </p>



<p>In 2017, an analysis of Maya records and astronomical data hinted that the Maya indirectly marked at least one comet by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063316302951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicting when meteor showers would dazzle the sky</a>. Between the years 250 and 909, six royal coronations happened within days of the annual Eta&nbsp;Aquariid meteor shower, researchers found, which occurs when Earth passes through the tail of Halley’s comet.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-fossil-lost-world-microbe-life">1.6-billion-year-old steroid fossils hint at a lost world of microbial life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Molecular fossils found in ancient sedimentary rocks have unveiled a lost world of primitive eukaryotes that dominated aquatic ecosystems from at least 1.6 billion to 800 million years ago.</p>



<p>The findings, published June 7 in <em>Nature</em>, come from laboratory analyses of rock samples from around the world that revealed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06170-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remnants of primitive compounds called protosteroids</a>. The majority of these molecules, which form in the process of creating steroids, were likely produced by primordial eukaryotes, relatively complex life-forms that today include animals, plants, algae and fungi, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Almost all eukaryotes produce molecules called steroids, like cholesterol, that are crucial components of cell membranes. Steroids don’t degrade easily and their remnants can be detected in sedimentary rocks as molecular fossils.</p>



<p>The last common ancestor of all eukaryotes lived around 1.2 billion to more than 1.8 billion years ago. But scientists know almost nothing about the abundance, ecology and habitats of those early microorganisms. Molecular and physical fossils of eukaryotes dated to 800 million years ago have been found. But farther back in time, their physical fossils become scarce and molecular fossils of the steroids become undetectable. The existence of protosteroids had been predicted but it was unclear what they would look like — or if they could even be detected — until the researchers figured out a way to re-create those molecular footprints in the lab.</p>



<p>“This study explains why we don’t see footprints of these guys in the rocks, as researchers were looking for the wrong thing,” says biologist Laura Katz, a biologist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who was not involved with the new work. “It fills a void in the fossil records.”</p>



<p>A dearth of obvious eukaryote fossils before 800 million years ago led scientists to speculate that the ecosystem at that time was dominated by bacteria. Alternatively, primordial eukaryotes may have simply lacked strength in numbers to leave behind detectable steroid remnants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some scientists had a different explanation: What if some intermediate molecule in the chemical pathway that produces modern steroids was actually the end product of the process in primordial eukaryotes? This theory had been proposed by the biochemist Konrad Bloch, who won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1964 for discovering the biosynthetic pathway of cholesterol.</p>



<p>To test this, geochemist Jochen Brocks of the Australian National University in Canberra and colleagues artificially matured molecules made in the first few steps of steroid biosynthesis, including lanosterol and cycloartenol. That revealed what the compounds’ molecular fossils would look like. Then the researchers looked for these fossils in tarlike bitumens and oils extracted from ancient rocks from all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers discovered a deluge of the protosteroids in samples ranging from deep to relatively shallow water environments. The oldest sample, dating back to 1.6 billion years ago, came from the Barney Creek Formation in Australia.</p>



<p>“One of the greatest puzzles of early evolution is, why didn’t our highly capable eukaryotic ancestors come to dominate the world’s ancient waterways? Where were they hiding?” says Benjamin Nettersheim, a geobiologist at University of Bremen in Germany. “We show that the protosteroid-producing microorganisms were hiding in plain sight and were in fact abundant in the world’s ancient oceans and lakes all along.”</p>



<p>While most bacteria produce a different molecule, called hopanoids, some bacteria also have the chemical tools to kick-start protosteroid production. But these bacteria exist in niche environments, such as methane seeps and hydrothermal vents. And their molecular footprints have not been found in sediments older than 800 million years, leading the researchers to conclude that eukaryotes dominated the ancient ecosystems.</p>



<p>“Konrad Bloch would have been delighted, had he lived, to see this,” says MIT geobiologist Roger Summons, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This paper has elegantly confirmed his prediction that biosynthetic precursors to cholesterol reflect ancient life’s quest for improvement.” (Bloch died in 2000.)</p>





<p>Making these steroid precursors requires less oxygen and energy, so that may have given the primordial eukaryotes an advantage in thriving in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fascination-earths-boring-billion">early Earth’s harsh low oxygen conditions</a>, the researchers propose (<em>SN: 10/30/15</em>).</p>



<p>“If true, [this study] suggests that we may be able to examine the stepwise evolution of eukaryotes at [an] unprecedented level of detail,” says evolutionary biologist Yosuke Hoshino of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, who was not involved in the study. “This is such a great opportunity to understand the evolution of complex life, which biologists have always dreamed of.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-cluster-milky-way-old-universe">A star cluster in the Milky Way appears to be as old as the universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the oldest known objects in the universe is wandering around the Milky Way.</p>



<p>Star cluster M92, a densely packed ball of stars roughly 27,000 light-years from Earth, <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2306.02180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is about 13.8 billion years old</a>, researchers report in a paper submitted June 3 to arXiv.org. The newly refined age estimate makes this clump of stars nearly the same age as the universe.</p>



<p>Refining the ages of clusters like M92 can help put limits on the age of the universe itself. It can also help solve cosmic conundrums about how the universe evolved.</p>





<p>The age is “on the edge of the age of the universe, as estimated by other groups,” says astronomer Martin Ying of Dartmouth College. “It helps us set the lower bound of the age of the universe. We don’t expect M92 to be born before the universe, right?”</p>



<p>Globular clusters like M92 are tight knots of stars that are thought to have all formed at the same time. That makes it easier for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">astronomers to measure the stars’ ages</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>). Stars that are born at different masses have different fates: The big ones use up their fuel quickly and die young, and the small ones linger. Figuring out how many of the cluster’s stars have aged out of the main parts of their fuel-burning years gives a sense of when the whole cluster was born.</p>



<p>But those estimates rely on assumptions about how stellar evolution works. Ying and colleagues wanted to find an age measurement that would sidestep those assumptions.</p>



<p>Using a computer, the team created 20,000 synthetic stellar populations for M92, each for a different possible cluster age. They then compared the colors and brightnesses for each of these populations with Hubble Space Telescope observations of M92 and calculated the age that fit the collection best.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time astronomers have measured M92’s age, but previous estimates relied on just one synthetic collection of stars. Comparing thousands of them reduced the uncertainty introduced by the assumptions baked into each one. The new technique reduced the uncertainty of the cluster age by about 50 percent, Ying says. The team found the cluster is 13.8 billion years old, give or take 750 million years. That’s strikingly close to the best estimate of the age of the universe: a smidge over 13.8 billion years, plus or minus 24 million years, according to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-planck-refines-cosmic-history">the Planck satellite’s measurement of the first light</a> emitted after the Big Bang (<em>SN: 12/20/13</em>).</p>



<p>The age of clusters like M92 is important partly because of a rising tension over how fast the universe is growing. Astronomers have known since the 1990s that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, thanks to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chameleon-force-new-dark-energy-experiment">a mysterious substance dubbed dark energy</a> (<em>SN: 8/25/22</em>). But recent measurements of the rate of that expansion, a figure called the Hubble constant, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">disagree with each other</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>One way around that tension is to accept a different age for the universe, says cosmologist and study coauthor Mike Boylan-Kolchin of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>



<p>“We often think about it as, Moses came down from Mount Sinai with ‘13.8 billion years’ written on some tablets or something, but it’s not quite like that,” he says. “If one takes the Hubble tension seriously, then one also has to say we don’t know the age of the universe that well.”</p>



<p>That’s where M92 comes in. Before spacecraft measured the cosmos’ earliest light, globular cluster ages were the best way to place limits on the age of the universe. That practice had fallen out of fashion for a while, says cosmologist Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the new work.</p>



<p>But improvements in computing, theory, and measurements of the distances to clusters like M92 make it worth trying again.</p>





<p>“The Hubble tension itself is a really challenging nut to crack,” Freedman says. This measurement alone isn’t precise enough to settle the debate. But “the more kinds of constraints we have, the better,” she says. “It’s showing a way for the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/irrigation-shift-earth-rotational-axis">Irrigation may be shifting Earth’s rotational axis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Runoff from irrigation has moved so much water from land to sea that Earth’s rotation might have measurably shifted.</p>



<p>Computer simulations suggest that from 1993 through 2010, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL103509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irrigation alone nudged the North Pole by about 78 centimeters</a>, researchers reported in the June 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters. </em>That would make irrigation the second largest contributor to polar drift after the ongoing rebound of Earth’s surface following the retreat of glaciers since the last ice age.</p>



<p>Researchers have long known that the North Pole wanders across the Arctic seascape in a circle a few meters in diameter. Seasonal weather patterns cause part of this cyclical drift, and long-term variations in the temperature and salinity of ocean water help drive <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solving-one-mystery-polar-wander">a 14-month-long oscillation dubbed the Chandler wobble</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/03</em>).</p>





<p>But those repeated vacillations aren’t the only things that move the pole around, says Clark Wilson, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin. There is also a subtler, noncyclic polar drift caused by the movement of land-based water to the sea from melting glaciers worldwide and from ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, he says.</p>



<p>Runoff from irrigation also plays a role — and a surprisingly large one at that.</p>



<p>In the first study to try and tease out the contributions of these water movements, Wilson and colleagues used computer simulations to assess how the impoundment of water behind dams, glacial melt, irrigation and several other factors might affect polar drift. Previous studies have suggested that irrigation shifted about 2 trillion metric tons of water from land-based aquifers to the oceans from 1993 through 2010 — enough to raise global sea level more than 6 millimeters.</p>



<p>Although seemingly minuscule, that redistribution of water was enough to shift the North Pole just over four centimeters each year on average during that period, the team found.</p>



<p>When all sources of water movement are considered — including the runoff of meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets — the North Pole drifted about 1.6 meters toward the east coast of Greenland in that time. The impact of irrigation was mostly to nudge the pole generally east of where it would have gone otherwise, the team found. Without irrigation, the pole would have drifted nearly the same amount, but toward the center of Greenland instead.</p>



<p>Unlike other drivers that vary over the course of a year, Wilson says, the polar drift due to irrigation is permanent and probably growing each year.</p>



<p>“The team’s findings all make sense,” says Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. “It’s important to realize that water is heavy, and when it moves around it’s going to affect Earth’s rotation.”</p>



<p>Besides shifting the North Pole, large-scale irrigation can also affect local and regional climates. Studies have shown that irrigation cools temperatures and boosts humidity in California’s Central Valley, as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watering-fields-california-boosts-rainfall-southwest">increasing rainfall in the Four Corners area</a> of the American Southwest and enhancing flow volumes in the Colorado River (<em>SN: 1/22/13</em>).</p>

<p>Two years after it was quietly retracted &#8220;due to plagiarism,&#8221; a <a href="https://doi.org/10.15159/ar.21.010">paper</a> by a prominent researcher in Latvia has set the country&#8217;s media ablaze, drawing comments from, among others, <a href="https://ir.lv/2023/04/06/caksa-un-kalvins-par-plagiatu-lu-pilnas-atbildes/">the minister of education and science</a> and <a href="https://www.la.lv/plagiats-ir-viens-no-smagakajiem-noziegumiem-akademiskaja-vide-tam-nav-noilguma-ta-lu-rektors">the rector of a leading university</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plagiarized paper came to public attention in March when the Latvian magazine <em>Ir</em> <a href="https://ir.lv/2023/03/22/profesors-petnieks-un-plagiats/">published serious allegations</a> against <a href="http://ww3.lza.lv/scientists/klavinsm.htm">Maris Klavins</a>, a professor and former dean at the University of Latvia. The allegations concern “possible fraud&#8221; in an EU-funded project headed by Klavins and include not only plagiarism but data falsification, budget irregularities and suspicious cash payments.</p>



<p>According to <em>Ir</em>, the Latvian police have opened a criminal investigation into the case. Klavins told the magazine he has not been charged in the matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Klavins called the allegations &#8220;lies&#8221; and said the &#8220;person responsible&#8221; for &#8220;my defamation and persecution&#8221; was his former PhD student <a href="https://www.uis.no/nb/profile/dmitrijs-porsnovs">Dmitrijs Porsnovs</a>.</p>



<span id="more-127339"></span>



<p>&#8220;Presently this case is under investigation within a legal process,&#8221; Klavins added. &#8220;Considering this, I cannot give comments on the case.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the article in <em>Ir</em>, Porsnovs discovered in 2021 that parts of an internal report he had written about the processing of algae for energy production had been <a href="https://doi.org/10.15159/ar.21.010">published</a> earlier that year by Klavins and others in the journal <em>Agronomy Research</em> – without listing him as an author or citing his work. Porsnovs, who is now a graduate student at the University of Stavanger in Norway, did not respond to requests for comments.</p>



<p>The magazine article includes examples of similar text and identical data in Porsnovs&#8217; report and Klavins’ paper, titled &#8220;Algae processing for energy production: development of waste pyrolysis technology.&#8221; <em>Ir</em> also notes that an ethics committee at the University of Latvia found &#8220;elements containing plagiarism&#8221; in the work of Klavins and his coauthors, according to a Google translation.</p>



<p>The university did not respond to requests for comments.</p>



<p>Porsnovs reportedly complained to the journal, which pulled the paper &#8220;due to plagiarism&#8221; on June 20, 2021, according to a note on the retracted article.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Ir</em> also published anonymous allegations from another former student of Klavins accusing the professor of stealing student work on a previous occasion.</p>



<p>Klavins, who is currently a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies/special_issues/R274PNLK26">guest editor of a special issue</a> of the journal <em>Energies</em>, has made perplexing statements to the media. He reportedly told <em>Ir</em> that the paper in <em>Agronomy Research</em> had &#8220;never been published,&#8221; but also claimed that he retracted it himself because it turned out to contain &#8220;erroneous data.&#8221;</p>



<p>Later, Klavins asserted that the right to use the text in Porsnovs&#8217; report &#8220;belongs to Linnaeus University in Sweden, on whose behalf the study was conducted,&#8221; according to a Google translation of <a href="https://www.tvnet.lv/7747703/lu-profesors-klavins-parmetumus-plagiatisma-sauc-par-apmelojosiem">an article</a> published April 5 by <em>TVNET GRUPA</em>.</p>



<p>A press officer at the university said she was not familiar with the case and referred us to acting university director Thorbjörn Nilsson, who could not be reached.</p>



<p>Porsnovs reportedly harbored suspicions toward the EU-funded research project from the beginning. He has alleged that two of Klavins&#8217; coauthors on the now-retracted paper were &#8220;fictitiously employed&#8221; and that one of them gave part of his salary to Klavins.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have seen with my own eyes several cases of transfer of cash,&#8221; Porsnovs wrote last year in a letter to an ethics committee for the University of Latvia, according to <em>Ir</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Porsnovs is currently involved in extensive litigation with the University of Latvia, the magazine said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-gene-therapy-muscular-dystrophy-kids">The first gene therapy for muscular dystrophy has been approved for some kids</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first gene therapy for children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The therapy can be used in 4- and 5-year-olds with the degenerative muscle disease, the agency <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-gene-therapy-treatment-certain-patients-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> June 22.</p>



<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common form of the muscle disease, is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which normally makes a large protein that acts as a shock absorber to keep muscle cells intact.</p>





<p>Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy don’t make this shock-absorbing protein and “damage themselves literally every time they contract their muscles,” Douglas Ingram, president and chief executive of Sarepta Therapeutics, the company that makes the newly approved gene therapy, said in <a href="https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/elevidys-delandistrogene-moxeparvovec-rokl-fda-accelerated-approval-call" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a conference call</a> discussing the approval.</p>



<p>The disease becomes fatal when heart muscles and muscles that control breathing also deteriorate. About 6 of every 100,000 people in Europe and North America has Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It mostly affects males.</p>



<p>The gene therapy is a shortened form of the dystrophin gene. This microdystrophin gene produces a protein about one-third the size of the original protein. The shortened gene is packed into harmless viruses for delivery to muscle cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The therapy “is groundbreaking as it … is designed to target the underlying cause of the disease,” Sharon Hesterlee, chief research officer for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, said in a statement.</p>



<p>Three other companies — &nbsp;<a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-doses-first-participant-phase-3-study-duchenne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pfizer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genethon.com/our-pipeline/duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genethon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solidbio.com/about/media/press-releases/pathway-development-consortium-announces-publication-in-human-gene-therapy-on-the-application-of-fdas-accelerated-approval-pathway-for-aav-gene-therapies-for-patients-with-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solid Biosciences</a>&nbsp; — are also developing shortened dystrophin gene therapies to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>



<p>Sarepta won approval by showing that children treated with the gene therapy make the shortened dystrophin protein. But Sarepta hasn’t yet completed an ongoing clinical trial to demonstrate whether the therapy actually works to restore muscle function. Results of that trial are expected this fall.</p>



<p>If the results are disappointing, the FDA or the company could decide to withdraw the therapy from the market. If the data show that the therapy is safe and effective, its use could be expanded to children and people of other ages.</p>



<p>Encouraging results might allow doctors to treat babies shortly after birth before their muscles are damaged, says Jerry Mendell, a neurologist at Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. He helped develop the gene therapy and has been conducting the clinical trials sponsored by Sarepta, but said he has no financial stake in the company.</p>



<p>Even better gene therapy for muscular dystrophy is on the horizon, Mendell says. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve done now is open the window for treatment for muscular dystrophy, we haven&#8217;t closed it. This isn&#8217;t the end. You&#8217;re going to see many improvements as time goes on.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780393867305" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Under Alien Skies</a><br><em>Philip Plait</em><br><em>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $30</em></p>



<p>Why is the sky blue? I remember asking my parents that question as a kid. When the sun’s rays hit the blanket of air that encircles the Earth, they told me, blue light scatters more than other colors. Despite my fascination with the cosmos, I never thought to ask what the sky would look like on other worlds.</p>



<p>Luckily, astronomer and science writer Philip Plait has. His new book, <em>Under Alien Skies</em>, is a bewitching cosmic ride through the solar system and beyond, transporting readers aboard futuristic starships to discover what the sky might look like above faraway landscapes. </p>





<p>Plait is the perfect captain on this expedition, vividly bringing these alien worlds to life while deftly weaving in the science to support the scenery. He even includes explanations of the space suits you’d need to stand and gaze at the skies on the moon, Mars, Pluto and other orbs.</p>



<p>In some cases, it’s not too hard to imagine the views. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">Thanks to rovers</a>, we’ve seen actual images of Mars’ sky (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 20</em>). It’s typically the color of rust, because the Red Planet’s atmosphere is chock-full of dust that tends to scatter red light the most. Pluto’s sky is vastly different. It’s so far away from the sun that, even at midday, the sky is utterly black and the stars are visible. </p>



<p>Contrary to what some articles on the internet say, the sun would not look like any other star in the sky. Standing on Pluto, the sun would appear one-fiftieth its size from Earth’s viewpoint. But it would blaze as a “painfully bright” dot, Plait writes, about 160 times as bright as the moon looks to us, and it would have a faint, deep-blue halo because Pluto’s thin air scatters short, blue wavelengths of light.</p>



<p>One of my favorite stops on Plait’s tour is the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, a two-lobed object shaped like a big rubber ducky. He lands readers on the larger lobe. Looking up toward the sky means seeing the rocks of the smaller lobe. “ ‘Smaller’ seems like the wrong word; it looks like an entire planet hanging over your head,” Plait writes.</p>



<p>Jetting to the smaller lobe, Plait points out a metal pole jutting from the rocks. The pole is attached to a box, turned off-kilter. It’s Philae, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rosetta-mission-lander-set-explore-surface-comet">the lander that bounced</a> and crashed on the comet in 2014 (<em>SN: 8/22/15, p. 13</em>). “Oh Philae,” Plait writes. “It’s so good to see you.” Finding Philae and exploring the aftermath of its crash would show just how fragile the comet is, Plait explains. The lander shattered the rocks it hit on impact, even though it was moving slower than a typical walking speed. The loose rock and ice would appear as wispy as piles of pixie dust.</p>



<p>The book ends with an aptly named final chapter, “The last sky you’ll ever see,” which contemplates the view from close to a black hole. Going inside a black hole is out of the question; you’d be toast. But from a safe distance, a starship can get a good peek with some telescopes — good enough that it feels like you’re hovering just above <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-boundary">the event horizon</a>, the black hole’s point of no return (<em>SN: 5/31/14, p. 16</em>).</p>



<p> Sitting there, you see … nothing. “No, that’s not fair,” Plait writes. After the long journey and the suspense of experiencing such a beast, you’d feel cheated if you saw seemingly empty space. Take a closer look, he says. If you squint, you can make out the rim around the black hole, where stars jostle, and then one slides along the curve of the horizon until its light flickers into that nothingness. You have a front-row seat to see the star’s light being bent by the black hole’s gravity. “It’s mesmerizing, if a bit disconcerting,” Plait writes. </p>



<p>If you could zoom in all the way to the center of the black hole, you’d see even weirder stuff. Exactly what, I won’t reveal; I’ll let you read the book and find out. I highly recommend you do.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunga-tonga-volcano-eruption-high-altitude-lightning">The Hunga Tonga eruption sparked the highest-altitude lightning ever recorded</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Hunga Tonga volcano eruption continues to break records. Its latest? The highest altitudes that lightning has ever been known to start.</p>



<p>The plume from the eruption <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL102341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produced lightning flashes</a> that kicked off 20 to 30 kilometers above sea level, researchers report in the June 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>The explosion of the underwater Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, in the island nation of Tonga, occurred in January 2022. The newly reported stratosphere-scraping flashes join the eruption’s growing list of standout stats, which include producing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunga-tonga-volcano-eruption-touched-space-lightning">greatest concentration of lightning ever detected and a plume so tall it touched space</a> as well as generating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-tsunami-shock-wave">a tsunami the size of the Statue of Liberty</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/22; SN: 8/29/22</em>).</p>





<p>Volcanic lightning occurs when colliding ash particles make static electricity. To estimate the altitudes of the eruption’s flashes, volcanologist Alexa Van Eaton and colleagues analyzed data from ground-based lightning detection networks, infrared maps of lightning captured by satellites and satellite images of the plume.</p>



<p>Though some types of lightning can extend much higher into the atmosphere, a lightning flash doesn’t typically get started more than 20 kilometers above sea level. That’s because the air pressure is too low to form “leaders,” the channels of hot plasma that make up the lightning typically seen in thunderstorms.</p>



<p>The rising plume from the eruption may have raised the air pressure enough to create lightning at unusually high altitudes, says Van Eaton, of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.</p>



<p>In the Hunga Tonga eruption data, “we’re seeing stuff that we’ve never seen before,” says Jeff Lapierre, a study coauthor and principal lightning scientist at the company Advanced Environmental Monitoring, based in Germantown, Md. “Hunga has completely changed the way we think of how natural events can change the atmosphere, and the environment where we thought lightning could exist.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-milky-way-phosphorus-habitable">Alien life may be possible even at the Milky Way’s edges</a></h4>

              
                <p>The discovery of phosphorus in a cloud at the edge of the Milky Way has extended the region in our galaxy where life might be found.</p>



<p>Phosphorus is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-phosphorus-life-building-block-saturn-moon">one of six essential elements for life on Earth</a>, along with nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur (<em>SN</em>: 12/16/22). Until now, it had been the only one of those elements missing from the farthest reaches of our galaxy. Finding phosphorus that far out could extend the galaxy’s habitable zone out from its center by roughly 22,000 light-years, researchers reported June 8 at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Albuquerque. That in turn could motivate astronomers to look in the hinterlands of the Milky Way for planets and any life they might harbor.</p>





<p>The team pointed two radio telescopes at a cool, dusty gas cloud at the edge of the galaxy. The cloud is a frigid –248° Celsius — a mere 25 degrees above absolute zero. It sits about 74,000 light-years from the galactic center, nearly triple the distance Earth is from the Milky Way’s core. And it has signatures of phosphorus monoxide and phosphorus mononitride, astrochemist Lilia Koelemay said at the meeting.</p>



<p>Looking for phosphorus in that distant cloud was a long shot, says astrochemist Lucy Ziurys, Koelemay’s collaborator at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The element is produced only in supernovas. But there’s not a lot of material in the outer Milky Way, so it’s hard to build stars big enough to end their lives in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-explosion-2020fqv-tess-hubble">massive, element-spewing explosions</a> (<em>SN: 11/2/21</em>). Beyond 49,000 light-years from the galaxy’s center, there is only one supernova remnant known, Ziurys says.</p>



<p>One way phosphorus could have ended up in the outer galaxy is through a supernova closer to the center that launched a &#8220;galactic fountain,&#8221; Ziurys says. “A supernova explodes, the material gets thrown out of the galactic plane, then settles back down near the galactic edge.” The material would be very diluted there, but “if there are different supernovae going off, they&#8217;re going to keep polluting the outer galaxy,” she says.</p>



<p>“The detection of the phosphorus-bearing molecules … seems clear and compelling,” says Francesco Fontani, an astrophysicist at the Italian Institute for Astrophysics in Florence, who was not involved in the study. He has observed <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/04/aa42923-21/aa42923-21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the other essential elements for life</a> in the outer galaxy, but never phosphorus.</p>

<p>Because astronomers had not found the six life-essential elements so far from the galactic center, they assumed the region where life could exist in the Milky Way — what’s called the galactic habitable zone — extended at most to the farthest supernova they’d found, about 52,000 light years from the galactic center. There’s an assumed inner edge as well at about 6,500 light-years from the galaxy’s core. The relatively large numbers of supernovas occurring there would expose any planets in the region to intense ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, making it difficult for life to last for long.</p>



<p>&#8220;This detection, together with previous detections of organic molecules at similar large distances from the galactic center, supports the idea that the outer boundaries of the galactic habitable zone could be wider than what we previously thought,” Fontani says.</p>



<p>For life to emerge so far from the galaxy’s center, planets would need to exist out there. So far, they have been observed only relatively close to the solar system — most within a few thousand light-years. “I don&#8217;t think we know right now whether they can form at larger galactic-central distances,” Ziurys says. Finding the six elements for life at the galaxy’s edge, she says, will hopefully spur on the search for the most distant places where it could thrive.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a financial advisor published a paper purporting to find that his colleagues who had pursued accreditation as “Certified Financial Planners” (CFPs) were more likely to engage in misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What the paper didn’t mention: That he had sued the CFP Board, the organization that offered that certification, and given up his own CFP marks “over a dispute regarding the integrity of the CFP Board&#8217;s disciplinary process,” according to a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jfr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jfr/fjad005/7102504">correction</a> to the article published in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The editors have determined its disclosure would not have impacted the peer review process, but it has since been added to the article for the benefit of readers,” the notice stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jfr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jfr/fjac012/7044787">Badges of Misconduct: Consumer Rules to Avoid Abusive Financial Advisers</a>,” was published in the <em>Journal of Financial Regulation</em> in February. In the abstract, the authors described their findings:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127334"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Using an adviser misconduct scoring framework we report specific misconduct ratings for each of the 625,980 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) advisers, finding elevated misconduct for Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) professionals and commission/fiduciary licensees.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors concluded that their findings “suggest that consumers who rely on a single market signal should avoid CFP® professionals if they wish to reduce misconduct risk.” But one of the group’s former collaborators has raised concerns that aspects of the methodology make the findings unreliable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper’s first author and the subject of the correction notice, <a href="https://www.camarda.com/about/team/dr-jeff-camarda/">Jeffrey Camarda</a>, a financial advisor with his own firm in Jacksonville, Fla., told Retraction Watch that “my CFP disciplinary issues are pretty ancient history,” and he considers them “unrelated” to the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, Camarda and his wife sued the CFP board alleging the organization had unfairly attempted to <a href="https://www.cfp.net/verify-a-cfp-professional/certification-and-background/f2ebc5b3-5447-48cd-bf66-b75835ebaad3?limit=20&amp;pg=1&amp;lastName=camarda&amp;firstName=jeffrey">discipline them</a>. This attempt, they alleged, amounted to breach of contract, unfair competition and violations of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lanham_act">Lanham Act</a>, which established federal trademarks and forbids false advertising. The CFP board, which has not responded to our request for comment, denied the allegations in a legal filing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A judge dismissed the Camardas’ case in 2015 at the request of the CFP board, writing that “Plaintiffs have identified no facts that demonstrate that defendant failed to follow its own procedures… In reviewing a disciplinary action by a private organization, courts do not ‘second-guess’ the organization’s interpretation of its own rules or its evaluation of the evidence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Camardas appealed the dismissal, but the appeals court upheld the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2017, after the legal battle ended, the CFP board <a href="https://www.cfp.net/verify-a-cfp-professional/certification-and-background/f2ebc5b3-5447-48cd-bf66-b75835ebaad3?limit=20&amp;pg=1&amp;lastName=camarda&amp;firstName=jeffrey">published</a> its disciplinary findings that the Camardas had misrepresented their advisory business as offering “fee-only” investment management and financial planning. This representation was inaccurate, the board determined, because they had a related business that received insurance commissions, and the businesses paid each other referral fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the process was bullshit,” Camarda told Retraction Watch. “We can demonstrate conclusively we were at all times in compliance with CFP® Board’s rules during the years we were licensed.” He and his wife voluntarily resigned their certifications because they had “lost respect for the integrity of the organization,” he said.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffcamarda/2019/09/23/americas-broken-financial-advisor-promisewhats-wrong-with-the-cfp-board--why-youd-better-check-twice-before-trusting-a-certified-financial-planner/?sh=3a4be61e3712">2019 article</a> for Forbes, titled “America’s Broken Financial Advisor Promise &#8211; What’s Wrong with the CFP Board &amp; Why You’d Better Check Twice Before Trusting a Certified Financial Planner,” Camarda included an extensive disclosure about the CFP Board disciplining him and his wife and their lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Camarda said he didn’t see how his history with the CFP Board was related to his recent paper, because the research wasn’t about the organization’s disciplinary processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails seen by Retraction Watch, Dan Awrey, a co-managing editor of the <em>Journal of Financial Regulation</em> and professor at Cornell Law School, wrote to one of Camarda’s co-authors in March, asking why the authors had not disclosed the potential conflict of interest as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13504851.2020.1854441">they had in previous work</a>. In response, Camarda elaborated:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research for you is not about CFP Board per se, but about the many factors (13 x 3 measures) that can be correlated to the documented misconduct we presented in the study; less than half of the studied independent variables include the CFP, and I note that some of the findings were actually favorable to CFPs, concluding&nbsp; CFPs with fiduciary investment licenses demonstrated the generally greatest degree of misconduct <em>suppression</em>. I am not really sure what the conflict would be, other than my past association and travails with them – about which <em>I</em> don’t feel conflicted at all. [emphasis original]</p>



<p>After discussion with the other managing editors and Oxford University Press, the journal’s publisher, Awrey wrote back to Camarda with the plan to publish the correction and add the conflict of interest statement to the article, which Camarda approved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to Awrey for comment, and got an auto-reply that he is on sabbatical. We also reached out to co-editor Geneviève Helleringer of the Essec Business School Paris-Singapore and University of Oxford, and did not hear back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for his lawsuit’s relevance to an article that critiqued the CFP Board, Camarda told Retraction Watch he wasn’t the only one criticizing the organization, pointing to coverage in the financial press. “It’s not like I’m the lone voice out there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After communicating the decision to publish a correction, Awrey sent Camarda another email on March 27 with the news that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The individual who brought the conflict of interest issue to the attention of the JFR Editorial Board has raised another objection to the paper, this time based on how you and your co-authors count the number of financial advisors in your study.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Awrey quoted a paragraph apparently from the “objection” he had received:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There is no credible source that claims there are 600,000+ financial advisors in the US. The Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132052.htm">estimates there are 263,030</a>; Zippia <a href="https://www.zippia.com/finance-advisor-jobs/demographics/">estimates there are 241,225</a>; Cerulli Associates &#8212; largely considered the most reliable industry source &#8212; <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/financial-advisor-headcount-total-addressable-market-tam-technology-hiring-growth/">estimates there are 311,305</a>… The authors knew there are not 626,000 financial advisors. Their own prior work described this issue in great depth. They included 300,000+ non-advisors because it created the illusion they wanted to create.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Camarda responded the next day that he thought the quote from the person who had contacted the journal was “delusional if not deceptive,” and attached papers that he said found similar numbers of financial advisors as he and his coauthors used in their work. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To be clear, our data includes all individuals licensed by FINRA to sell securities on a commission basis: “brokers”. This is the actual regulatory count, not a mere estimate&nbsp; and should trump “estimates” of financial advisors, itself a squishy term that, for instance, often includes CPAs or life insurance sales agents that are not FINRA licensed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On March 30, Awrey wrote back:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We really appreciate your continued cooperation. From our perspective, we now consider this matter closed. My sincere apologies for the runaround and any anxiety or frustration it may have caused.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A former collaborator has also publicly raised concerns about the paper’s methodology. Soon after the article was published, Derek Tharp, a CFP and assistant professor of finance at the University of Southern Maine, published a <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/badges-of-misconduct-cfp-study-camarda-lee-de-jong-journal-financial-regulation-flaws-advisor-headcount/">blog post</a> pointing out issues in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, Tharp wrote that it was likely that less than half of the nearly 626,000 professionals registered with FINRA Camarda and his co-authors analyzed were financial advisors, so the relationship they found between CFP certification and advisory-related misconduct was “a classic spurious correlation.” He cited a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2020.1854441?journalCode=rael20">paper</a> he had published previously–with Camarda–that had proven the same point about using the FINRA data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is simply untrue to state as fact that our data was so tainted by non-advisors as to be invalid,” Camarda wrote in an extensive <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/badges-of-misconduct-cfp-study-camarda-lee-de-jong-journal-financial-regulation-flaws-advisor-headcount/#comment-6140601960">comment</a> responding to Tharp’s post. “Even a casual reading of our paper makes clear we only include those with the Series 7 or 6 commission sales licenses all in the industry should appreciate are associated with retail ‘advisors.’”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/badges-of-misconduct-cfp-study-camarda-lee-de-jong-journal-financial-regulation-flaws-advisor-headcount/#comment-6150062136">reply</a>, Tharp wrote that “your method of limiting an analysis to only Series 6/7-licensed individuals is not remotely sufficient for removing non-advisors from your dataset.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Camarda’s response also critiqued the other <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2020.1854441?journalCode=rael20">paper</a> Tharp cited in the post on which he was a coauthor. The additional data Tharp used to limit FINRA’s list of licensees to only financial advisors was “unreliable” and not suitable for research, Camarda said, and Tharp had thrown out a lot of the data. Camarda sent the critique to Mark P. Taylor, the editor of <em>Applied Economics Letters</em>, which published the paper. He said he had not received a response, and neither did we when we reached out for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Camarda also told Retraction Watch that he was “not happy” his name was on the paper, as he had withdrawn from the research project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tharp disputed that Camarda had withdrawn from the project, and that the data he had used was not good enough for research. As far as the data he excluded, he told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The purpose of limiting the sample to only those working solely as financial advisors was not to try and claim that we had provided a comprehensive identification of all advisors within this market. It was to examine whether the observed positive correlation between CFP status and misconduct persisted when the analysis was limited to only those solely working as financial advisors. If we would have found that this relationship persisted, then this would have cast serious doubt on my suspicion that the positive correlation was being driven by a spurious relationship.</p>

<p>On paper, data scientist Gunasekaran Manogaran has had a stellar scientific career. He earned an award as a young researcher from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and landed a series of postdoctoral and visiting researcher positions at universities in the U.S, including the University of California, Davis; Gannon University in Pennsylvania; and Howard University in Washington, D.C. His h-index — a measure of a researcher’s impact and productivity — is 60, a number that by one&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283832/">model</a>&nbsp;would mark him as “truly unique” if achieved within 20 years. He did it in fewer than 10.</p>



<p>Emails obtained by Undark<em>,&nbsp;</em>however, suggest some researchers have doubts about his publishing record. The correspondence includes an initial message from someone claiming to have previously worked with Manogaran. It was sent to some 40 editors of scientific journals, many owned by major scientific publishers: Elsevier, Springer Nature<em>,&nbsp;</em>Wiley<em>,&nbsp;</em>and Taylor &amp; Francis among them.</p>



<p>The sender alleges that Manogaran and others run a research paper publishing scam — one that both generates revenues and artificially burnishes the scientific bona fides of individual and institutional participants. In particular, the alleged scheme targets what are known in the scientific publishing industry as “special issues” — self-contained special editions that are not part of a journal’s regular publishing schedule, typically focused on a single topic or theme.</p>



<p>The email, dated April 12, 2022, informs the journal editors that they may have partnered with members of this alleged scheme and urges them to take action. “If you don’t do that there would be a next group doing the same scam in name of different persons,” the email states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parachute-paleontology-science-colonialism-fossils">Paleontology has a ‘parachute science’ problem. Here’s how it plays out in 3 nations</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the Cretaceous Period, roughly 100 million years ago, the dinosaur <em>Ubirajara jubatus</em> probably turned heads with its feathers, shoulder rods and flashy displays. In 2020, the petite theropod made headlines as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-fuzz-rods-feathers-first-southern-hemisphere">the first feathered dinosaur discovered in the Southern Hemisphere</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/20</em>).</p>



<p>Today, the dinosaur is notorious for different reasons: Shortly after the news of its discovery, its backstory quickly drew some red flags.</p>



<p>The fossil had been unearthed in Brazil’s Araripe Basin, yet no Brazilian researchers were involved in its study. The researchers initially said they found the fossil in a Brazilian museum and brought it to a German museum in 1995 for further study, yet that museum later revealed it bought the fossil in 2009 from a private company. That company imported the fossil to Germany in 2006, yet it’s not clear if that import was legal.</p>





<p><em>U. jubatus</em> isn’t unique in this sense. A supposed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/museum-fossil-links-snakes-lizards">four-legged, 120-million-year-old snake (<em>Tetrapodophis amplectus</em></a>), for example, also made an unsanctioned trip from Brazil to Germany (<em>SN: 7/23/15</em>). And then there’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-shark-fossil-weird-fins-manta-ray-underwater-flight"> a roughly 90-million-year-old shark (<em>Aquilolamna milarcae</em>) from Mexico with a fantastic wingspan</a>, which may have been purchased by a private collector through a legal loophole<em> &nbsp;</em>(<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>These and many other cases of fossil fishiness are part of a long trend of what some call “parachute science” (or in this case “parachute paleontology”) and “scientific colonialism.” </p>



<p>These umbrella terms describe practices where scientists from high-income countries travel to middle- and low-income countries to study or collect fossils and fail to collaborate with or involve local experts. Or they skirt local laws around fossil collection and export. Sometimes the fossils are removed from their home countries under dubious or outright illegal circumstances. In other cases, the scientists purchase fossils from dealers, smugglers or private collectors in their own countries. The trend is linked to the legacy of colonialism, as many of the lower-income countries also happen to be former European colonies, while the higher-income ones are former colonizers.</p>



<p>“We’re talking about 21st century science here … so it shouldn’t be happening. It’s just too much,” says Juan Carlos Cisneros, a paleontologist at Universidade Federal do Piauí in Teresina, Brazil.</p>



<p>When researchers ignore local expertise, obtain fossils illegally or just buy specimens outright, it encourages corruption in communities near fossil beds, discourages early-career scientists from pursuing their profession and can result in unethical or poor-quality research. Illegally traded fossils not only violate the laws of their home countries, but they might also be separated from their geological context or modified by collectors.</p>



<p>To some degree, these practices were long seen as part of <a href="https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/pdfs/commentary_benefit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how paleontology and geology work</a>, says Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany. “I’ve heard it described as a conquest culture, where the Earth is there to be explored and exploited to further advance our understanding of the history of Earth,” she says. While other fields have raised their standards for field research, Dunne and others see paleontology as behind the times.</p>



<p>To understand the extent of parachute paleontology, Dunne and her colleagues compiled a database that tracked where the authors of more than 26,000 fossil publications were based. The team found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01608-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">97 percent of these papers came from researchers based in high- and upper-middle-income countries</a>. The United States, Germany and the United Kingdom top the list of countries with the most publications on foreign fossils, the researchers reported in the February 2022 <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>. Some countries’ fossil deposits were also being studied more than others, either because those countries had more funds to do their own research or because foreign researchers wanted to travel there, says coauthor Nussaïbah Raja, a paleobiologist also at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biggest publishers</h3>



<p>The authors of most papers on fossils are from North America and Europe, researchers reported in 2022. The United States leads, with similar amounts of foreign and domestic research. The next three countries — Germany, the United Kingdom and France — all conduct more research abroad than they do domestically. The analysis was based on more than 26,000 publications from <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Paleobiology Database</a> that have author affiliations. The catalog has caveats, however: Submissions are voluntary, which makes it an incomplete picture of the field.</p>

<p>Based on ratios of publications that include local authors and those that don’t, the team developed an index for countries most at risk for parachute paleontology. Those countries include places like the Dominican Republic, Myanmar and Namibia, the team reported in the same study<em>.</em> But the problem is widespread, they found.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">At risk</h3>



<p>To measure how parachute paleontology impacts countries, paleobiologist Nussaïbah Raja and colleagues created an index number, based on the ratio of the number of domestic to foreign authors on papers about fossils from those countries. The Dominican Republic and Myanmar, which top the list, are both hot spots for fossils preserved in amber, which have become highly commercialized.</p>

<p>“As soon as you give people cold, hard numbers, they suddenly just turn around and listen. And that was our whole aim,” Dunne says. Researchers used similar methods to dig into how those numbers play out in three countries: Brazil, Mexico and Myanmar. Each country acts as a case study showing a spectrum of the different ways parachute paleontology hurts communities where fossils are found.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Brazil</h4>



<p>Brazil passed a law in 1942 that defines fossils as property of the federal government and another law in 1990 that regulates foreign research efforts within the country. The country allows exporting but requires a permit and a partnership with a Brazilian science institution. Commercial trading of fossils within the country is prohibited.</p>



<p>Yet an analysis of papers from 1990 to 2020 on Cretaceous vertebrate and plant fossils discovered in the Araripe Basin showed that over half of those 72 publications described <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fossils that ended up in a different country</a>. And of the nearly 60 percent of papers on exported fossils, none mention export permits, Cisneros and colleagues reported in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em> in 2022. While one included details about fieldwork performed by the authors, details on collection permits were lacking.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exported heritage</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-6">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow">
<p>Since Brazil does not allow fossil exports without permission, paleontologist Juan Carlos Cisneros and colleagues looked at where some of the country’s fossils are housed. They analyzed 72 papers from 1990 to 2020. Each paper described the fossils of a new Cretaceous vertebrate or plant species found in Araripe Basin. The researchers limited their analysis to publications on holotypes, go-to specimens that represent a species, because of the sheer volume of publications on this basin and the importance of those types of fossils to paleontology. The majority of these holotypes are no longer in Brazil, the team found, making it much harder for Brazilian researchers to access them. To study a fossil at a museum in Germany, Cisneros says, “I will be asked for a visa, I will need to spend money in a currency that is six times more expensive than my own.”</p>

<p>Over half of all the publications described fossils that were probably bought, and many did not include local authors. Less than half of the publications were led by Brazilian researchers. Notably, those that were led by local scientists contained fewer issues, such as missing permit information or references to purchasing fossils.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Parachute problems</h3>



<p>Brazil also regulates fossil excavations and what happens to specimens after they’re excavated. In their analysis of 72 papers on Cretaceous fossils from Araripe Basin, Cisneros and colleagues looked at the prevalence of different issues linked to parachute paleontology. These issues included whether the study mentions permits to excavate or export the fossil and any evidence that fossils may have been purchased (despite the sale of fossils being illegal in Brazil). The team also looked at whether local paleontologists were involved in or led the work. The most prevalent issues in Brazil appear to be the export of fossils without permission and the purchase of fossils despite local regulations.</p>

<p>The infamous <em>T. amplectus</em> exemplifies many of these trends. Originally <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa9208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a four-legged snake</a>, the fossil was discovered in Brazil and subsequently made its way to Germany without the involvement of Brazilian researchers. The original research team claimed that the fossil was permanently housed in a museum, when in fact it belonged to a private collector, and the researchers could not produce evidence that the specimen had been exported legally. To top it off, a team that included a Brazilian scientist later <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14772019.2021.1983044?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;role=tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disputed the claim</a> that the ancient critter was even a snake.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-aligncenter">

<p>To date, the original paper has not been retracted and the fossil remains in Germany. After the specimen was reportedly damaged in a CT scan, the private collector temporarily <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-fossil-of-a-snake-like-lizard-has-generated-controversy-beyond-its-identity-171568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoked access to researchers</a>, and now paleontologists <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/update-controversial-four-legged-snake-may-be-ancient-lizard-instead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can study</a> the specimen only at the private museum where it’s currently on loan.</p>



<p>“Overall, these [issues] have an effect of making younger generations become less interested in science,” Cisneros says. “Students become frustrated, because they see that foreigners are basically doing their research.” In Brazil, fossils are considered part of the national heritage. When fossils are housed in other countries, he says, it becomes incredibly difficult for local researchers to study their own heritage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mexico</h4>



<p>As in Brazil, fossils are considered property of the federal government in Mexico and cannot be exported permanently without permission or commercially traded. The country also has guidelines for foreign researchers that include working with local scientists.</p>



<p>And yet, many of the issues found with Brazilian fossils <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cropped up here as well</a>, Cisneros, Dunne and colleagues reported in the same 2022 study.</p>



<p>The team focused on 126 publications from 1990 to 2021 on Jurassic and Cretaceous fossils of vertebrates, invertebrates and other species from sites in the Sabinas, La Popa and Parras basins. Nearly half of these studies were not led by Mexico-based researchers. And most were missing information on collection permits, whether they were headed by local or foreign scientists.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common problems</h3>



<p>In their analysis of 126 papers on fossils from select sites in Mexico, Juan Carlos Cisneros and colleagues looked at the same set of publication issues as they did with papers on fossils from Brazil. In Mexico, paleontology appears to have benefitted from a long history of regulation and enforcement around archaeological artifacts, with generally fewer issues across the board. The country still struggles with specimens ending up in private collections and an absence of collection permit information among work led by both local and foreign scientists.</p>

<p>Unlike in Brazil, most of the fossil specimens in the study range stayed in Mexico. The country’s success in preventing fossil smuggling could simply come down to stricter enforcement, Cisneros says, and a long history of regulation in paleontology’s sister field, archaeology.</p>



<p>Interestingly, compared with Brazilian fossils, a slightly higher fraction of fossils from Mexico ended up in private collections, which present their own access challenges. “In private collections, you depend [on] the goodwill of some millionaire,” Cisneros says. When fossils are sold to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sale-t-rex-fossil-big-loss-science-dinosaur">private owners like millionaires</a> or <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/nicolas-cage-and-leonardo-dicaprio-owned-dinosaur-skulls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollywood celebrities</a>, scientists lose access, and thus, the ability to study the specimens (<em>SN: 12/2/22</em>).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Questionable collections</h3>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-20">
<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow">
<p>For fossils from Mexico, Cisneros and colleagues analyzed 126 papers from 1990 to 2021. Each paper described one or more Jurassic or Cretaceous fossils of a vertebrate or invertebrate organism — or nontraditional fossil specimens such as dinosaur tracks or petrified wood — from one of three basins. Compared to Brazil, Mexico appears to have a much better record on illicit fossil export, the team found. Most of the fossils from the publication dataset remain in Mexico. Just one paper describes fossils that were collected in the 1930s and exported to the United States.</p>

<p>The long-finned fossil shark described in 2021 came under scrutiny when researchers initially claimed it was housed in a museum that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-01-19/mexican-millionaire-builds-controversial-replica-of-mansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hadn’t been built yet</a>; it <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ancient-shark-fossil-exquisite-some-researchers-wonder-if-they-ll-be-able-study-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was actually in a collector’s stash</a>. They later updated the paper to say that the shark <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would temporarily be housed</a> in a different museum. The collector also told <em>Science</em> that the rock that contained the fossil had been purchased, not the fossil itself, and that the sale was thus legal.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, these fossils would be studied and stored in museums near where they are discovered. “If they go to the to the local museums, they will improve the local economy, the social conditions of the community,” Cisneros says. But even within Mexico, that’s not the case. Many fossils are housed in museums in big cities far from the rock formations where they existed for millions of years.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Myanmar</h4>



<p>Myanmar has always been renowned as a source of fossilized insects, plants and reptiles preserved in amber. But in recent years, the country has experienced an extreme case of colonialism in paleontology.</p>



<p>The volume of Myanmar amber publications over the past several decades experienced <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03847-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge spike beginning in 2014</a> that appears to correlate with political shifts in the country, Dunne and colleagues reported in September 2022 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. “It just suddenly explodes,” she says. “And that&#8217;s eye-catching. It gives you a sense that something else is fueling it, rather than just research interest.”</p>



<p>Amber exports exist in a legal gray area because amber is classified as a gemstone, which can be exported legally while fossils cannot. News reports suggest that scientists who study Myanmar amber might buy it across the border in Chinese markets, from dealers or from internet websites. And there are concerns about where the money from those sales ends up.</p>



<p>In 2010, the Myanmar military began taking over the country’s gemstone mines, where amber deposits are often discovered. By 2017, it had complete control. Over the decade or so since, publications on amber fossils started piling up, as have reports of the Myanmar military’s human rights violations and conflicts with ethnic militias. Then in 2021, military leaders staged a political coup and overthrew the government.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conflict fossils</h3>



<p>Around 2014, the worldwide number of papers on fossils preserved in Myanmar amber began to spike, paleobiologist Emma Dunne and colleagues reported in 2022. The timing coincides with some gemstone markets opening near the Chinese border with Myanmar. The trend also tracks with the military’s gradual takeover of gemstone mines beginning in 2010. The increase in paleontologists accessing Myanmar amber through those markets was probably very gradual at first, Raja says. It could have been as simple as “a paleontologist, by coincidence, sees something that&#8217;s really cool, and then [they] tell their paleontologist friends, and then more and more people start going to these markets to find more [amber specimens].” The team opted to look at three-year rolling averages of publications to account for the fact that peer review and publishing takes time.</p>

<p>Both the military and ethnic militias have used these mining operations to fund their operations, and ethical questions about researchers acquiring Myanmar amber specimens began to mount even before the coup. While there’s no paper trail to connect the Myanmar military or militias to amber fossils described in journals, the study rings alarm bells that paleontologists who purchase fossils might be inadvertently helping fund a military coup and human rights violations. “Even if it&#8217;s the tiniest little impact that you&#8217;re making, why make it at all?” Dunne asks.</p>



<p>The authors on Myanmar amber studies published during that spike from 2014 to 2021 were predominantly based outside the country. Even over a broader period from 1990 to 2021, just five out of 872 publications on Myanmar amber included researchers from Myanmar. Over the same period, publications on fossils from Myanmar that were not preserved in amber did not see the same disparity.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Local collaboration</h3>



<p>Paleobiologist Emma Dunne and colleagues looked at who was publishing papers on both amber and nonamber fossils from Myanmar after amber publications began to spike in 2014. While local authors were rarely involved in work on amber fossils, they were much more involved in work on nonamber fossils, often primate species. Foreign collaboration with local researchers tends to be more common on nonamber fossil work because those studies often involve fieldwork in remote areas and access to local museum collections. Political conditions in Myanmar have made foreign travel to the country more difficult, so local collaborators make that research possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reversing these research trends <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01472-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have positive ripple effects in Myanmar</a>, two of the study’s coauthors, Myanmarese geologists Zin-Maung-Maung-Thein of the University of Mandalay and Khin Zaw of the University of Tasmania in Australia, wrote in a letter to <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em> in 2021. By working with scientists within Myanmar, “not only will scientific research standards improve within the country, but Myanmar’s people will gain a better understanding of the importance and scientific value of their own natural heritage rather than being robbed of it.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next?</h4>



<p><em>U. jubatus </em>— the flamboyant theropod — might get a happy ending. The journal <em>Cretaceous Research</em> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195667120303736?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrew</a> the discovery paper. And after an investigation and public outcry, Germany <a href="https://bnn.de/karlsruhe/karlsruhe-stadt/innenstadt/naturkundemuseum-muss-dino-fossil-an-brasilien-zurueckgeben-ubirajara-jubatus-ministerium-rio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed in July 2022 to return the fossil to Brazil</a>. The fossil <a href="https://www.gov.br/mcti/pt-br/acompanhe-o-mcti/noticias/2023/06/apos-retorno-ao-brasil-fossil-ubirajara-jubatus-e-levado-para-o-ministerio-da-ciencia-tecnologia-e-inovacao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally returned home</a> in June, and <em>U. jubatus </em>will ultimately become part of collections at the Museu de Paleontologia Plácido Cidade Nuvens near where it was first excavated in Ceará, Brazil. “It symbolizes a new phase in the way of doing science with respect for national laws and the rights of societies,&#8221; the museum&#8217;s director Allyson Pinheiro said in a statement. </p>



<p>The field itself hasn’t changed overnight and still has work to do to achieve lasting change. The pressure to publish papers that make splashy headlines, which drives some of this bad behavior, as Dunne notes, isn’t going away.</p>



<p>Many of the same names and foreign institutions keep cropping up in the analyses. In some cases, by purchasing a fossil or failing to get permission from local governments to excavate, those individuals appear to have broken local laws. “Some groups of researchers have always been notorious for conducting parachute science in the most unethical ways. And they just get a free pass by the community,” Dunne laments.</p>

Cisneros <em>et al</em>/<em>Royal Society Open Science</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Combating the issue will require work on all fronts, Dunne and Cisneros agree: Journals must raise the bar on the information they require on a fossil’s origin and chain of custody; funders need to require that their grant recipients work with local experts and follow the laws of the country where the fieldwork is taking place; governments have to enforce those laws; and foreign researchers should collaborate with and credit their local counterparts.</p>



<p>In response to the recent data, social media campaigns and wider public awareness, some journals have changed their policies to require evidence of a fossil’s origins or necessary permits, but changes have been sporadic. <em>Cretaceous Research</em> previously declared it would not publish studies of fossils with unclear provenance, yet articles about Myanmar amber deposits still appear in that journal. The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology took a strong stance on Myanmar amber, initially issuing a moratorium on publications based on specimens collected after 2017 and later amending it to amber acquired after the coup in 2021, with guidelines for how to handle specimens collected before then. But vertebrates are only one slice of the fossil record, and many amber fossils preserve insects and plants.</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01479-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-out moratoriums</a>. Some paleontologists have argued that laws aimed at protecting fossils suppress science by <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/November-2011/Protect-and-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limiting the number of fossils that are excavated</a> and <a href="https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/why-palaeontologists-must-break-the-law-a-polemic-from-an-apologi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discourage amateur fossil collecting</a>. “If you are in a country that bans fossil collecting and you find a really nice ichthyosaur jaw lying on the beach … are you going to leave it there for the tide to wash it away? The hell you are,” David Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth in England and a coauthor on the <em>U. jubatus </em>paper, <a href="https://www.geocurator.org/images/resources/geocurator/vol10/geocurator_10_10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in <em>The Geological Curator</em> in 2018</a>. </p>



<p>Legal commercialization of fossils in some countries complicates the issue. Raja recalls recently walking into a main street shop in a German city and seeing Moroccan sharks and a Mongolian dinosaur egg for sale just a few doors down from big brands like H&amp;M. While a dealer might have some documentation on the fossil’s legality, it’s hard to say for sure. “It’s really widespread in some countries,” Raja says. “I can go to a shop in Germany and just buy a fossil.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/decode-arecibo-alien-message-math">Here’s how we could begin decoding an alien message using math</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the most famous messages ever beamed to space was a string of 1,679 bits sent by the Arecibo radio telescope in 1974. But if E.T. sent us such a string, how could we Earthlings even begin to decode it? A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new mathematical approach</a> proposes a way.</p>



<p>For anyone trying to interpret the Arecibo message — a drawing depicting a person, the DNA double helix, the solar system and the telescope itself, among other information — they’d first have to understand that it was an image at all, and that the image was 23 pixels wide and 73 pixels tall. </p>

<p>As it sent the signal, the radio antenna encoded the 1,679 bits by flipping between two different frequencies, representing one and zero respectively. If you line the bits up differently — placing more or fewer than 23 pixels per row — the image looks like a random mess.</p>



<p>We’d face a similar challenge if aliens sent us a message. How would we know the number and size of its dimensions?</p>





<p>The Arecibo scientists built a clue into the transmission: 23 and 73 are prime numbers — a scheme other intelligent life might recognize, if they too find primes to be interesting. But alien messages could come in many forms and have many dimensions, says Brian McConnell, a computer scientist at Notion Labs in San Francisco, and author of <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-74845-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alien Communication Handbook</a></em>. A message might be a database in which each element is not just a value but a list of values, or a list of lists. A message in the form of a physics simulation could include a series of measures for each point in spacetime.</p>



<p>The new decoding method, developed by Hector Zenil, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge and the founder of Oxford Immune Algorithmics, and colleagues, takes a string of bits — an incoming message — and looks at every possible combination of dimension number and size. 100 bits, for example, might be 1&#215;100 or 10&#215;10 (two dimensions) or 4x5x5 (three dimensions) or 2x2x5x5 (four dimensions) and so on.</p>



<p>It then looks at each possible configuration’s orderliness in two ways. To get a measure of local order, it breaks the message into patches. For each patch, it searches a catalog of trillions of tiny computer programs the researchers had previously created to explore algorithmic space, and counts how many programs generate an identical patch. (The programs’ outputs were precomputed and saved, making searches fast.) The more programs that create an identical patch, the higher the patch’s score for local order. The patch scores are averaged to get an overall local order score for the entire configuration. The researchers also measure each possible configuration’s global order by seeing how much an image compression algorithm can shrink it without losing information — mathematically, randomness is less compressible than regular patterns. By combining the local and global scores, the researchers have a sense of how likely each configuration is to be the correct one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="213" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2.jpg" alt="An image of a black background with a rainbow of different colors scattered across the frame." class="wp-image-3125373" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2-330x103.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3125373">Arranging the string of Arecibo bits into an image 73 pixels wide by 23 pixels tall would scramble the intended visuals (color added). But a mathematical approach could still reveal the message.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125373">Jarmo Kivekas/Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team tested the method on a version of the Arecibo message that had been expanded to six times its size, so the width was now 138 pixels. In one analysis, the researchers arranged the sequence of bits into images ranging from 0 to 200 pixels across, a subset of possible configurations. Graphing image width on the x axis and the likelihood score on the y axis for each configuration, there were a few sharp spikes, the most prominent at 138. The method showed similar success when parsing other messages encoded as bits, including several other images, an audio file and a 3-D MRI scan.</p>



<p>The new approach could also handle the kind of noise that might be introduced as a message travels through space. In another analysis, the original Arecibo message’s width of 23 pixels stood out even when a quarter of the bits had been flipped from 1 to 0 or vice versa.</p>



<p>“This paper is quite exciting, because what we have shown is that if you have a piece of information that is not completely random, then it actually encodes the original space in which it was intended,” Zenil says. In other words, the message tells you its own geometry.&nbsp;He notes that in Carl Sagan’s sci-fi novel <em>Contact</em>, and the movie based on it, the characters spend a lot of time figuring out that a message received from aliens is in three dimensions (specifically a video). “If you have our tools, you would solve that problem in seconds and with no human intervention.”</p>



<p>Even if aliens send a continuous signal rather than bits, he says, the method could help find the right sampling frequency for digitizing it. It would just add more configurations to try.</p>



<p>“What I like about it is that it’s a mathematically rigorous approach to characterizing a transmission,” McConnell says of the technique, which has not yet been peer reviewed. What’s more, “most of the people in the SETI community” — referring to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence — “focus on signal detection. They don’t tend to give a lot of thought to what would come after that.”</p>



<p>SETI researcher Douglas Vakoch, the president of METI International, a nonprofit that studies how we might message extraterrestrial intelligence, notes that the new approach frees prime numbers to serve a secondary purpose in parsing a message. “Instead of being a guide to&nbsp;<em>discover</em>&nbsp;the format, they can now be used to&nbsp;<em>confirm</em>&nbsp;that the decoders found the correct solution,” Vakoch wrote via email.</p>





<p>(“Primes are somehow very special in a mathematical sense,” Zenil notes, “because they can be thought of as a compressed version of the natural numbers.” But there are also other types of interesting numbers to choose from, many listed in the <a href="https://oeis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.)</p>



<p>Of course, even if we could detect and format the message, we’d still need to interpret it correctly. Might a shape indicate an alien body, a spacecraft, an equation or a smudge?</p>



<p>Zenil notes that the approach has potential terrestrial applications, for instance in deciphering intercellular signaling. He’s also already used conceptually similar methods to identify important components in gene regulatory networks — if you perturb one part, does it make the overall system less intelligible? An algorithm that pieces together smaller algorithmic components in order to explain or predict data — this new method is just one way to do it — may also help us one day achieve artificial general intelligence, Zenil says. Such automated approaches don’t depend on human assumptions about the signal. That opens the door to discovering forms of intelligence that might think differently from our own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are actively recruiting a Co-Editor-in-Chief for <em>Complex Systems</em>. Stay tuned for announcements from the journal!<br></p>



<h3><strong>Extending our mission to new communities</strong></h3>



<p>We see <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new journals</a> as an opportunity to give evolving research communities opportunities to forge a new path for research in the field. Whether that means welcoming new ways of sharing research transparently, or cementing new policies that enable research to be evaluated and rewarded more fairly, or simply finding a broader audience where research can make a greater real-world impact.<br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>I&rsquo;m really excited to deepen our work with the research communities and stakeholders who will be a part of these journals. We have worked intentionally with these communities of researchers who have shared a need for venues that do more than help researchers share their work. Our journals will provide a space for experts of different disciplines to come together, to spark important discussions, and to explore and shape Open Science practices that will drive the field forward.</em></p><cite>Rebecca Kirk<br>Publisher, Portfolio Development</cite></blockquote>



<p>Our new journals will encourage open-sharing behaviors that support rigor, reproducibility, and rapid dissemination of research. And we&rsquo;ll hold ourselves accountable for that progress. As with all PLOS journals, we&rsquo;ll offer opportunities for authors to share preprints, improve access to data and transparency of methodologies, and choose to publish their peer reviews. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">Open Science Indicators</a> will allow us to establish benchmarks for open-sharing behaviors in these fields for the first time, and to track changes over time to test whether our solutions are working.</p>



<p>We also very much want researchers to be active partners in shaping how we do this in responsible and inclusive ways that fit the needs of the community. We look forward to engaging with these stakeholders more deeply and working with them in evolving the new titles, as we have across our portfolio.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Enabling equitable opportunities to participate</strong></h3>



<p>A key element of expanding openness for PLOS is in bringing diverse voices together. Inclusivity and equity are core to a strong foundation of Open Science, and we need to hear from all perspectives in order to make science, the process of publishing science, and the solutions science inspires, more robust. <em>PLOS Mental Health</em> and <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> will strive to represent research from local experts around the world, and from across various disciplines.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re also exploring which of our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-series">APC-alternative models</a> best serve the researchers who will publish in <em>PLOS Mental Health </em>or <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em>. We guarantee each journal will provide a mechanism for institutional support that enables more authors to publish Open Access, regardless of personal funding resources.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h3><strong>How you can get involved</strong></h3>



<p>As we build these journals, we&rsquo;ll be getting to know our new Editors-in-Chief, recruiting Editorial Board members from a diverse range of disciplines, and learning more about how we can best meet the needs of researchers in these communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about the journals, applying to join the Editorial Board, or signing up for news and updates you can learn more by visiting our websites for <a href="https://plos.org/mental-health-research-journal/#EdBoard"><em>PLOS Mental Health</em></a> or <a href="https://plos.org/complex-systems-research-journal/#EdBoard"><em>PLOS Complex Systems</em></a>. </p>

<p>A journal co-published by two scientific societies is retracting nearly 80 papers after an “investigation into peer review fraud.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-electronic-imaging?webSyncID=eb6ce194-2379-30c5-2b52-a0c6e1339127&#038;sessionGUID=bdb0d55a-7e92-b7b9-9973-be69d5b3c006"><em>Journal of Electronic Imaging</em></a> is retracting the articles – all originally published in special sections between 2021 and 2023 – starting this week. The journal is co-published by &#8220;SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics,&#8221; and IS&amp;T, the Society for Imaging Science and Technology.</p>



<span id="more-127328"></span>



<p>According to a <a href="https://spie.org/news/journal-of-electronic-imaging-to-retract-papers?SSO=1">press release</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The publishers found evidence of large-scale manipulation of the peer review process, including fake reviewer accounts, repeating reviewers, and generic reviewer reports throughout different special sections. In addition, many out-of-scope papers were discovered to have been published in these special sections.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A review by external experts also:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>identified many instances of poorly formed experiments, out-of-date references, evidence of AI-generated language, and limited datasets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the release, Gaurav Sharma, vice president of publications at IS&amp;T and former editor in chief of the journal, said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The manipulation and subversion of the JEI peer review process by a handful of bad actors is deplorable, and we will not let them profit from their shameful actions. We will sanction the perpetrators and correct the scholarly record. We have also added new safeguards in our processes to thwart any future attempts at peer review manipulation.</p>

<p>The case is just the latest to shine a spotlight on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">special issues</a>, which seem vulnerable to paper mills.

                <p>Note: This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference</a> (fast forward to minute 31 to begin watching). This is the 3rd in a series of four blogs posts on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-takes-people-willing-to-disrupt-the-system-to-move-it-forward/">part two</a>, I highlighted how shifting to Open Science practices can have meaningful and long-lasting impact.</p>

          <p>In my earlier blogs, I centered the discussion around how overcoming institutional inertia and Open Science practices can be drivers in how we can collectively change the scholarly publishing industry for the better. But a large question remains. Better for whom? We tend to think that the US and the EU are &lsquo;centers of the universe&rsquo; for scientific knowledge.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>You can probably tell where I am going with this. Too much of the discussion about transitioning to Open Science frames these problems in the context of the Global North. There are global challenges in scholarly publishing that must be addressed. That&rsquo;s why PLOS is also focused on supporting new models for global recognition and inclusion.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.inasp.info/">International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications</a> recently released a study to understand the challenges and opportunities that Open Access (OA) presents to low- and middle-income countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While stakeholders believe that they clearly benefit from OA, the picture that emerges is significantly more complicated. There&rsquo;s a clear conflict between a desire to strengthen local platforms that better serve local needs and feeling pulled to &ldquo;play the game&rdquo; in which norms have been set by the Global North. I mentioned a crop scientist in Africa in my first blog. This is exactly the problem she ran headlong into.</p>



<p>As we&rsquo;ve begun to deepen our work with global research communities at PLOS, our approach is centered on listening, learning, and building together. Most critically, we know that our strategy and business models cannot be separated from our drive toward equity.</p>



<p>A rigid approach to Open Science won&rsquo;t foster equitable participation<strong> </strong>from all communities. We need to be malleable, so we&rsquo;ve designed our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new journals</a> so that they:<strong></strong></p>



<p>o&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Represent diverse communities of Open Science practice</p>



<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Have inclusive publishing criteria and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">editorial policies</a></p>



<p>o<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/">Share costs more equitably</a> and factor in countries ability to pay</p>



<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a couple of examples.</p>



<p>The first is our work over the past few years to develop new business models for Open Science that move us away from APCs. Those are Article Processing Charges, a fee that authors pay to publish &ndash; instead of a subscription to read.</p>



<p>Back when PLOS was launched and focused in the biomedical sciences, charging authors a fee to publish seemed fair and reasonable. Those authors were awarded huge grants and if a nominal fee meant that anyone could read and reuse the paper, it was a price worth paying.</p>



<p>But we failed to anticipate how successful APCs would become, how commercial publishers would exploit this space, and how inequitable they would become. Waivers would not solve the problem. Continuing down an APC path will further disenfranchise researchers in less generously funded fields, as well as those in low- and middle- income countries and risks deepening existing inequality.</p>



<p>So, we&rsquo;ve chosen a different path. When we launched our new titles last year, we introduced our new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity Model.</a> This model provides a pathway for institutions to cover the cost of unlimited publications for their authors and eliminate APCs. What makes it different is that fees for each institution are adjusted by World Bank lending tier groups to be more reflective of <em>their </em>regional economy. The Global Equity model systematically acknowledges economic differences. It offers an appropriate solution so that authors in these regions do not need to <em>ask </em>for assistance, they are simply included.</p>



<p>We still have a robust <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/">publication fee assistance program</a> for any researcher who cannot afford APCs. But we hope that as our partnerships with institutions expand, this will no longer be the <em>only</em> recourse available to researchers<strong>, </strong>merely a backup option.</p>



<p>A second example is our policy to improve transparency in the reporting of research conducted in other communities. And to limit an action coined as<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> &ldquo;Parachute Science.&rdquo;</a></p>



<p>&ldquo;Parachute science&rdquo; is a term describing how researchers sometimes drop down from an ivory tower in the wealthy Western world into a foreign community for field work. They gather their data, and then zip off home without engaging with or acknowledging the contributions of the local researchers.</p>



<p>This disparity has been reported as far back as 2 decades. One study illustrated that only 6.5% of research articles in general medical journals had a coauthor from the country where the study population lived. I find that number shocking, even if it is now somewhat dated.</p>



<p>The PLOS policy requires information about ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations as well as local authorship. This information is shared with editors and reviewers to help assess whether the research meets the PLOS&rsquo; standards for research integrity.</p>



<p>Our policy has been developed in close collaboration with members of the research community across the globe and includes multiple research areas. We hope the policy will improve awareness of the concerns related to global research, laying foundations for future development of additional policies in this area. And I&rsquo;m delighted to say that several other publishers have reached out for our advice, and have implementing similar policies for their titles, most recently <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife">eLife.</a></p>



<p>There is also an important role for local solutions. Let&rsquo;s return again to that crop scientist in Africa. She decided to publish her findings in an African journal. The improved visibility and accessibility of her research influenced the Kenyan government in developing nutrition schemes for schools. Other African governments have also adopted the schemes. In a significant irony, wealthier countries are now adopting these nutrition findings to support balanced diets.</p>



<p>Creating easier paths to publish Open Science research is only one part of the equation. Next month, I&rsquo;ll talk about what comes next with regards to how we can better change scholarly publishing for all researchers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-starlight-galaxy-quasar-black-hole">In a first, JWST detected starlight from distant galaxies with quasars</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CAMBRIDGE, MASS. —</strong> For the first time, astronomers have detected starlight from distant galaxies that host extremely bright supermassive black holes called quasars.</p>



<p>Data from the James Webb Space Telescope reveal that four of these galaxies are massive, compact and possibly disk-shaped, astronomers report June 12 at the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~eilers/firstlight.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JWST First Light meeting</a>. Studying the galaxies could help solve the mystery of how black holes in the early universe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big">grew so big so fast</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/21</em>).</p>





<p>“Ever since the discovery of [distant] quasars, there have been studies trying to detect their host galaxies,” said MIT astrophysicist Minghao Yue. But until JWST’s sharp infrared eyes came along, it wasn’t possible. “This opens up brand new windows towards finally understanding luminous quasars and their host galaxies.”</p>



<p>Quasars are black holes that are feeding so furiously, the material they gobble heats to white-hot temperatures, shining brighter than the stars in the galaxy around them. They’re so bright and distant that each appears as a single, starlike point of light.</p>



<p>Two independent groups used that starlike quality to erase the black hole glow from images of their galaxies, like a sculptor coaxing a figure out of marble.</p>



<p>Yue and colleagues used JWST to observe six quasar-hosting galaxies. Around the same time, astrophysicist Xuheng Ding of the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Tokyo and colleagues used JWST to look at another pair of quasars. The light from all the quasars was emitted more than 12.8 billion years ago, or less than a billion years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>The teams used actual stars in the images to simulate the starlike shapes of the quasars. Then they subtracted the simulated quasar from the image of each whole galaxy, and voilà: Only starlight remained.</p>



<p>Ding’s team got a direct peek at both of their galaxies, while Yue’s team glimpsed two of their six. All the measured galaxies appear to be less than a tenth as wide as the Milky Way, measuring between 2,600 and 8,000 light-years across. The two galaxies that Yue and colleagues observed contain enough stars to make up between 10 billion and 100 billion times the mass of the sun, the researchers estimate. The pair that Ding and colleagues looked at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14329" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weigh in at about 25 billion and 63 billion solar masses</a>, the team reported at the meeting and in a study to appear in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Those masses are comparable to that of all the stars in the Milky Way, which in total add up to roughly 60 billion times the mass of the sun. That’s surprisingly massive for so early in the universe’s history.</p>



<p>What’s more, the galaxies seem to break a rule set by observations of galaxies in the nearby universe. Locally, galaxies tend to split their mass between stars and black holes in a predictable way: The more massive its central supermassive black hole, the more stars a galaxy has. These galaxies appear to pack more mass into their black hole than their amount of stars should allow.</p>



<p>“At least for these luminous quasars, they really are over-massive,” Yue said.</p>



<p>The mass calculations might prove to be overestimates, says astrophysicist Paul Shapiro of the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in either study. Converting the light that JWST can see into stars rests on assumptions about how many stars of various masses a galaxy has. Modern galaxies have a lot more dim, lightweight stars than bright, hefty ones, so astronomers typically assume that the brightest stars they see are just the tip of the iceberg. But that might not have been the case 800 million years after the Big Bang, Shapiro says.</p>





<p>“You’re observing the tail and inferring the dog,” he says. “If there were a mass distribution that favors high-mass stars, you could be significantly overestimating the mass associated with the light.”</p>



<p>But “the fact that we can see it at all is very exciting,” says astronomer Madeline Marshall of the National Research Council Canada in Victoria. The fact that two groups are reporting starlight from quasar hosts independently is very convincing, she says.</p>



<p>“Pre-JWST, we could not detect host galaxies of [distant] quasars,” she said at the meeting. “Now, with only the first year of observations … we can actually detect some of these hosts for the first time.”</p>



<p>These first few quasar hosts are just the beginning, Ding says. JWST is scheduled to observe at least 10 more, some of which are even farther away. A larger sample will help astronomers figure out enduring cosmic riddles about how black holes and galaxies influence each other as they grow.</p>



<p>“We don’t know how black holes can be so big in the early universe,” Ding says. “You need to understand the environment of this monster, how it can collect so much matter to it. So knowing the conditions — the mass of the host galaxies, for example — at least then you can say how their local environment is.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genomics-daphne-martschenko-scientists-to-watch">Daphne Martschenko is a champion for ethical, inclusive genomics research</a></h4>

              
                <p>Daphne Martschenko found inspiration for her career at summer camp. For five summers, beginning after her junior year in college at Stanford University, Martschenko worked at Camp Phoenix, which is for youth from low-income backgrounds in the San Francisco Bay Area, primarily Oakland and San Jose. </p>



<p>Camp Phoenix focuses on “joyful learning in an outdoor camp environment,” she says, and her experiences there ignited her passion for making education more equitable for students, regardless of their race or socioeconomic background.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></figure></div>


<p>She ultimately pursued a Ph.D. in education, but today her work goes beyond that field. Now a bioethicist at Stanford University, Martschenko is interested in how findings from social and behavioral genomics — the study of how genetic differences among individuals influence complex behaviors and social outcomes — affect society at large, including inequity and injustice and how we respond to them. </p>



<p>With abundant access to genetic information, researchers can now ask new questions about what influences human behavior. But such studies can be prone to bias and can be misinterpreted or co-opted to promote unscientific and even harmful ideas.</p>





<p>Today’s science tells us <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/race-label-genetic-stigma-diversity">that race has no basis in genetics</a>, but genetics has been invoked throughout history to justify slavery, racial discrimination, forced sterilization, xenophobic immigration policies and more. A white gunman who killed 10 Black people in a Buffalo supermarket in 2022 <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-must-consider-the-risk-of-racist-misappropriation-of-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited a genetic study to support his heinous act</a>.</p>



<p>Martschenko&#8217;s work focuses on how genomics research can be conducted in a way that is social and ethical, can include community engagement and can be clearly communicated. She looks at the downstream effects of the research, especially social harms, and develops strategies to prevent those harms. She wants to stop “the unintended consequences of our research from playing out,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bridging disciplines</h4>



<p>Martschenko brings her life experiences to her work. Her father, Ukrainian, and her mother, Nigerian, were living in Kyrgyzstan before her birth. As a child, she lived for a time in Moscow and Ukraine, but she spent her most formative years in the United States. As a biracial woman who identifies as Black, she has experienced people’s negative perceptions firsthand.</p>



<p>She earned her bachelor’s degree in medical anthropology and Slavic studies and a master’s in politics, development and democratic education. Martschenko’s Ph.D. work, which included focus groups and surveys with primary and secondary school teachers, looked at how genomics research on cognitive abilities and educational attainment affected how teachers thought about their students and whether they believed the research was relevant to their teaching. There’s a tendency to think of students in certain racial groups as “not having certain abilities,” she says. She wanted to “contribute to disrupting those harmful narratives.”</p>



<p>More recently, Martschenko has helped create a <a href="https://elsihub.org/collection/race-genetics-and-genetics-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading list</a> that draws on scientific papers from social psychology, sociology, genetics education and more to explore how people think about the relationship between race and genetics. She has also built a publicly available repository of open-access <a href="https://www.thehastingscenter.org/genomic-findings-on-social-and-behavioral-outcomes-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQs on genomics studies</a> for The Hastings Center. This repository aims to make materials that communicate the context, scope and limitations of studies more accessible and so help prevent misinterpretation and misapplication of those studies.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Setting out the facts</h3>



<p>Daphne Martschenko has helped put together <a href="https://www.thehastingscenter.org/genomic-findings-on-social-and-behavioral-outcomes-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a repository of frequently asked questions on genomic studies</a>, which aims to communicate the findings of social and behavioral genomics in a responsible way. An example FAQ for the study “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8159746/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Childhood trauma, life-time self-harm, and suicidal behaviour and ideation are associated with polygenic scores for autism</a>,&#8221; which appeared in <em>Molecular Psychiatry</em>, is shown below.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What did the study examine?</strong> This study examined whether genetic variants associated with autism are also associated with childhood trauma. </p>



<p><strong>What year was it published?</strong> 2019</p>



<p><strong>Key findings</strong></p>



<p>1. Individuals with a greater number of autism-associated genetic variants were more likely to report childhood trauma, self-harm and suicidal ideation.</p>



<p>2. Several social and environmental factors influenced the relationship between autism-associated genetic variants and trauma.</p>



<p>3. It is important to identify sources of trauma for autistic individuals in order to reduce their occurrence and impact.</p>



<p>4. The associations were very small for all outcomes.</p>

</div>





<p>“The idea of getting out in front of the controversy and explaining things in a clearer way so that they&#8217;re not just reacting to misuses of the science, but they’re trying to get out in front of it — I think that’s the key attribute of her work,” says bioethicist Steven Joffe of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</p>



<p>One strategy Martschenko employs is called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8756526/pdf/main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adversarial collaboration</a>, a term originally coined by the Nobel Prize-winning economist and behavioral psychologist Daniel Kahneman. This approach invites people with opposing viewpoints together to collaborate. They celebrate their disagreements and understand their roots.</p>



<p>To that end, Martschenko is coauthoring a book with Sam Trejo, a quantitative social scientist at Princeton University who uses genomic data to study how social and biological factors shape human development. Martschenko and Trejo have different perspectives on how much genes matter and how to address social inequalities. Their book will unpack the social, ethical and policy issues that have come with the DNA revolution.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engaging diverse perspectives</h4>



<p>Another theme of Martschenko’s work is community engagement. She seeks ways for study participants to be equal partners with researchers. Getting people together, particularly those who haven’t been historically included in conversations around how to study genetics and behavior, helps makes science more inclusive and equitable, Martschenko says. “We need more marginalized representation in research,” she adds, but building trust and access is key.</p>



<p>It’s not enough to have study participants just give an OK for you to use their data, says Barbara Koenig, a medical anthropologist who works in bioethics at the University of California, San Francisco. “My sense is that we have to move away from consent,” she says; study participants need to be collaborators.</p>



<p>Recently, Martschenko, another facilitator and eight community partners came together to design a framework for introducing polygenic scores — a measure of a person’s risk for a disease based on genetic factors — into clinical care. When and how to use such scores in providing health care has been a contentious issue, since they can prove inaccurate and be misinterpreted. Martschenko hopes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36765027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the work provides a framework</a> for others who want to engage local communities in designing clinical programs.</p>



<p>Facilitating conversations on controversial and ethically charged topics, especially as a young researcher, is not easy work. To destress, Martschenko does a lot of yoga. “It is my safe place to go,” she says. She is a champion rower and uses the lessons she has learned from it to get people working in sync regardless of the conditions.</p>



<p>She says her background has prepared her well for her current work. “I feel like I found my space,” she says. “I found the place where I&#8217;m destined, where I&#8217;m meant to do the work that I&#8217;m doing.”</p>

<p>Last September, a researcher at a university in Bangladesh emailed a journal about a paper he had published in 2019. He made a stark admission: the paper contained plagiarism, said Sorif Hossain, a lecturer in statistics at Noakhali Science and Technology University, who called for the article to be promptly retracted.</p>



<p>But the paper remained in place. Only after Retraction Watch contacted the <em>European Journal of Environment and Public Health</em> (<em>EJEPH</em>) last week did it issue a retraction. </p>



<span id="more-127314"></span>



<p>The<a href="https://www.ejeph.com/article/retraction-note-salinity-and-miscarriage-is-there-a-link-impact-of-climate-change-in-coastal-areas-13394"> retraction notice</a> states that the article, “<a href="https://www.ejeph.com/article/salinity-and-miscarriage-is-there-a-link-impact-of-climate-change-in-coastal-areas-of-bangladesh-a-6291">Salinity and Miscarriage: Is There a Link? Impact of Climate Change in Coastal Areas of Bangladesh &#8211; A Systematic Review</a>,” was “retracted due to plagiarism, analysis errors, and writing issues.” The paper has been cited six times, according to Google Scholar (the journal is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modestum, <em>EJEPH</em>’s publisher, told Retraction Watch that, following an extended exchange with Hossain, a retraction note was “uploaded to the journal publication system, but final confirmation from the author was not well received and it stayed invisible.”</p>



<p>The publisher also promised to “investigate this issue further and [to] take necessary measures against those involved.”</p>



<p>Retraction Watch became aware of the case earlier this month when Amir Abdoli, an associate professor of medical parasitology at Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in Iran, contacted us about the EJEPH article. Abdoli pointed out that it includedd a figure from a 2016 publication of his, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987716000451?via%3Dihub">Salt and miscarriage: Is there a link?</a>,” in the journal <em>Medical Hypotheses</em>, without permission or even citation.</p>



<p>An analysis using the online comparison tool<a href="https://www.copyscape.com/compare.php"> Copyscape</a> revealed that in addition to the duplication of a figure from Abdoli’s paper, the majority of the 2019 article’s abstract <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Compare-Two-Web-Pages-or-Articles-Copyscape.pdf">closely resembles</a> the abstract of Abdoli’s article in both phrasing and structure, with nearly 45% of the text of Abdoli’s abstract exactly duplicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mustafa Younis, <em>EJEPH</em>’s editor-in-chief, told Retraction Watch that the publisher screens all articles with anti-plagiarism software before they reach him. He referred us to Modestum for further comment.</p>



<p>However, Hossain said that he had repeatedly contacted Modestum, Younis, and Veritas Publications, the journal’s previous publisher, to request that the journal remove or retract the article. He sent the first of these requests to Veritas in January 2021, writing, “I don&#8217;t want to retract the paper but want to remove this paper from this site.”</p>



<p>The publisher explained that the “only option we have is to publish a retraction notice for the article in the upcoming issue.” In a March 2021 email that Retraction Watch has seen, Hossain replied: “I am agreed to proceed with the<strong> retraction procedure </strong>and hope to get the update as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>What happened after the exchange, if anything, is unclear. From the correspondence shared with Retraction Watch, it does not appear that the editor or publisher made any inquiries about the reasons Hossain wanted his paper retracted.</p>



<p>However, in a September 2022 email to Younis and Modestum, Hossain admitted that his paper contained plagiarism and asked for it to be withdrawn or retracted:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My goal is to remove this paper. It has some plagiarism, analysis error, and writing issues. That is why I want to withdraw my paper. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Modestrum acknowledged that Hossain had contacted them and Veritas several times about withdrawing or retracting the article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The author repeatedly asked that the article should be “removed” from the website, and not retracted. We see that, in several occasions, the author agreed with the retraction, and later “changed his plan” and “decided to not retract”. These communications with the earlier publisher took place from January 2021 to March 2021.</p>



<p>Then, during the publisher change, we started receiving another set of “removal” requests from this author. We explained that the article cannot simply be “withdrawn” or “removed” from the journal, and explained the retraction procedure. The retraction note was prepared, it was uploaded to the journal publication system, but final confirmation from the author was not well received and it stayed invisible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Though the retraction notice originally stated that it was published in January 2023 and available online since September 2022, the date was later changed to June 2023. The text of the retraction notice was also changed to offer an explanation for the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emails forwarded to Retraction Watch by Hossain show that while he did ask for his article to be “removed” and not “retracted,” he sometimes used the terms interchangeably.</p>



<p>According to Hossain, he wanted the article retracted because of the duplication of the figure and close paraphrase of the abstract of Abdoli’s 2016 article. At the time of writing the article, his first as an undergraduate student at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh, he said he did not understand how to properly cite and incorporate images and sources, nor the seriousness of his offense.</p>



<p>“However, when I knew that it [was] a big problem,” he said, “then I contacted the journal to retract this article.”</p>



<p>In a September email Hossain said was his last to the publisher until this month, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have discussed this with my supervisor and decided to <strong>withdraw</strong> my paper.</p>



<p>Kindly take the necessary actions regarding this matter and publish this retraction notice in the current issue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response, Hossain said the publisher responded that they would publish the retraction in the January 2023 issue of the journal. The fact that they did not, he told Retraction Watch, “is really unacceptable.”</p>

Phil is a qualified career development practitioner and currently works as an Associate Professor at the University of Warwick&#8217;s Centre for Lifelong Learning where he is Director of Graduate Studies and teaches on postgraduate courses in career development and career coaching. His work addresses the context, theory, and practice of career development in the contemporary world.</p><p>Discover his thoughts on career development and the future of work. &nbsp;</p><h2>1. What initiatives can organizations put in place to enhance their employees&#8217; careers?</h2><p>One of the best ways organisations can enhance their employees’ careers is through access to career coaching. Career coaching can be accessed through external providers or delivered internally by suitably trained members of staff.</p><p>The key to this training lies in helping the career coach learn how to forge an appropriate relationship between the career coach and the employee. This tends to be seen nowadays as a form of&nbsp;<em>learning alliance</em>. The alliance needs to be initially agreed in relation to the initial, middle, and end phases of career coaching interactions.</p><p>Once established, this coaching relationship can be used to support the career learning of employees in relation to a wide range of topics including career influences, workplace relationships, and career management styles. As part of their training and development, career coaches also need to engage in reflexivity and assessment.</p><p>Read Phil McCash’s article <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.15">“Cultural Learning Theory and Career Development”</a> in <em>The Oxford Handbook of Career Development</em> (2021) for more on cultural learning theory and coaching.</p><h2>2. What are the most common obstacles in career development?</h2><p>One of the biggest problems identified in the career development field is the decline in decent work. This rise in precarious work is resulting in work instability and poverty for growing numbers of workers throughout the world. The reduced availability and quality of jobs globally has negative consequences for the individual, community, and society. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.3">Ellen Gutowski and others argue</a> for the necessity of decent work for all.</p><div><blockquote><p>“Career development theory and practice have the potential to foster a sense of belonging and well-being by facilitating the construction of meaningful life-careers.”</p></blockquote></div><p>A further and related issue is social justice. Career development theory and practice have the potential to foster a sense of belonging and well-being by facilitating the construction of meaningful life-careers. Social justice issues are integral because they are concerned with fairness and equity, (in)equality, cultural diversity, psychosocial well-being, and societal values. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.14">Barrie Irving argues</a> that we need a deeper understanding of social justice and the multiple and complex influences on how “career” is interpreted and “opportunities” are presented. Such an understanding should provide critical insight into the effects of wider sociocultural and political concerns affecting what is deemed possible in the shaping and enactment of career.</p><h2>3. Can career theories be applied globally?</h2><p>Career theories from the Global North have sometimes been imported and applied uncritically in the Global South countries. These theories were developed in different socioeconomic and cultural contexts than those of the Global South, which can generally be characterized by vulnerability and instability. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.17">Marcelo Ribeiro argues</a> that these theories and practices must be contextualized if they are to be of assistance to the users of career development services. Through intercultural dialogue, we need to contextualize theories to assist people with their career issues and foster social justice. We also need to understand career theories and practices produced in the Global South (Latin America, Africa, and developing countries of Asia) and their potential as an alternative to expand the mainstream career development theories from the North. Such theories can be understood as a Southern contribution to the social justice agenda.</p><h2>4. How does increased flexibility impact employees and organizations?</h2><p>Increased flexibility and its impact have been debated in the field of organisational studies for many years. Organizational career development theory highlights three different perspectives on career.</p><p>First, and most commonly, organizations are seen as the context that constrains and enables individual careers. Second, careers may be valued as enhancing or limiting organizational performance and subject to talent management practices. Third, careers can be conceptualized as an ongoing process of interaction between individuals, organizations, and the broader social context.</p><p>The move from a focus on organizational careers to highly flexible, self-driven, boundaryless careers in the 1990s overemphasized individual choice and individual responsibility. These ideas became the accepted rule, leading to a divided workforce, with real choice available only to some categories of workers. The psychological contract between individual and organization was largely undermined, and the role of the organization and the importance of contextual and structural factors were relatively neglected.</p><p>To move forward, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.11">Kate Mackenzie Davey argues</a> that this opposition between organization structure and individual agency is best avoided. The future of organizational career development theory requires an understanding of both the individual and social context, and their interaction over time.</p><h2>5. What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?</h2><p>Debates about the future shape of the working world feature regularly in the field of organisational and managerial career studies. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.12">Hugh Gunz and Wolfgang Mayrhofer propose a Social Chronology Framework</a> in which the study of careers should be seen to involve the simultaneous application of three perspectives: being, space, and time. Building on this, they emphasise the importance of a coevolutionary perspective. Within a bounded social and geographic space, career development happens based on configurations of individual and collective career actors who provide context for each other and coevolve together. They argue that this approach can suggest new ways of seeing established career development arrangements.</p><p>In addition, the world of work is inevitably shaped by public policy frameworks. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.6">Christian Percy and Vanessa Dodd set out a conceptual model</a> of the economic outcomes of career development work. It is centred on the financial metrics that are most important to stakeholders at three different tiers of the economy. These tiers include individuals, organizations/employers, and the state. Empirical examples from the literature are provided to show that financial impacts can be identified at each tier. The limitations of the model and the evidence base are discussed. In addition, a critical examination of a narrow focus on economic outcomes in public policy is presented in order to convey the limitations of an economistic rationale for career development.</p><p>Taking this further, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.9">Pete Robertson explores</a> and questions the aims of public policy for career development. In the early years of the twenty-first century, an international consensus emerged in the literature describing the intentions of governments when they seek to intervene in the careers of their citizens. He makes a case for a broader conception of the socially desirable outcomes from career interventions. Drawing on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, he proposes a systematic framework of six types of policy goal for career development services:</p><ol><li>labour market goals</li><li>educational goals</li><li>social equity goals,</li><li>health and well-being goals,</li><li>environmental goals, and</li><li>peace and justice goals.</li></ol><p>The latter three categories represent new or relatively neglected areas of focus. The proposal highlights cross-cutting themes of social justice, sustainability, and societal change within public policy for career development in the coming years.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/pages/what-is-the-future-of-work?utm_campaign=1600526366456057904&amp;utm_source=oupblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=button&amp;utm_term=mccash"><strong>Visit the Rethink Work hub for more organizational psychology insights</strong></a></p></blockquote><p><em><sub>Featured image: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/747389663/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/747389663/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f06%2fCareer-development-stock-image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-eduardo-salas-and-scott-tannenbaum/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Eduardo Salas and Scott Tannenbaum</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/finding-purpose-for-the-corporate-office/">Finding purpose for the corporate office</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-veronica-schmidt-harvey-and-kenneth-p-de-meuse/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Veronica Schmidt Harvey and Kenneth P.

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Cover-Photo-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h4>Menstruation in a Refugee Settlement</h4>
<p>In humanitarian settings, individuals who menstruate face numerous obstacles in managing their menstrual health (MH). The barriers are profound, including scarcity of sanitary materials, washing supplies, and safe, private spaces for changing and disposal.</p>
<p>Despite a growing <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/programs/gate/our-work/menstruation-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commitment</a> from the humanitarian field to address MH through the introduction of new guidelines, research, and programming, the solutions introduced to combat these challenges have often fallen short. They are implemented across diverse humanitarian settings without sufficient tailoring to address unique contextual nuances, such as geographical factors, existing infrastructure, and cultural beliefs surrounding menstruation. Most importantly, the voices of those directly affected — residents of humanitarian spaces, particularly individuals who menstruate — are rarely included in the design and development processes.</p>
<h4>A Human-Centered Design Approach</h4>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://wearealight.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alight</a>, a non-profit organization in the humanitarian sector, and <a href="https://www.kujakuja.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuja Kuja</a>, a global data collection firm, our team at <a href="https://www.ylabsglobal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YLabs</a>, a global design and research organization, set out to develop a Human-Centered Design (HCD) solution with and for individuals who menstruate in the Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda in 2020.</p>
<p>HCD is an approach that prioritizes the needs, perspectives, and experiences of end beneficiaries, and uses a creative and participatory process in co-designing, developing, and testing potential solutions. In our case, this meant deeply involving individuals who menstruate and other community stakeholders, allowing them to lead on key decision-making points.</p>
<p>One of the processes used to ensure that end beneficiaries are highly involved in the development of solutions is called co-design. Co-design is grounded in the belief that all people are creative and, as experts of their own experiences, bring different points of view that inform design and innovation direction. During the co-design process, we used various participatory activities such as card sorting, journey mapping, and role playing to gain deeper insights and challenge assumptions about our potential solutions. Overall, we conducted over 340 interviews, focus group discussions, and working sessions to ensure we were building something that was addressing the primary needs of individuals who menstruate.</p>

<p>In total, four concepts were tested to assess their desirability, cultural acceptability, and feasibility. Among these interventions, the Cocoon Mini emerged as the most promising concept. The Cocoon Mini is a secure and private MH management-dedicated space that offers access to a personal latrine, a bathing facility, and waste disposal options. Based on its potential, we advanced the Mini into a three-month pilot program.</p>
<h4> From Co-Design to Design Principles</h4>
<p>Throughout the research, co-design, and prototyping phases, we created four design principles and a set of tips for how to design MH spaces in humanitarian settings at scale.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring physical and physiological safety among individuals who menstruate is more important than the MH space itself.
<ul>
<li>During prototyping of the Cocoon Mini, individuals who menstruate raised concerns about the potential risks of abuse, both physically and psychologically, that they might face from men and boys. They shared that when public spaces are explicitly designated for MH, they can draw unwanted attention. To address this, we worked together with young people to redesign existing latrines, prioritizing safety and user-friendliness.</li>
<li>Tips to ensure safety at scale: Maximize privacy in every MH space to ensure user safety and discretion. Incorporate essential elements like tall privacy walls, robust doors with secure locks, interior lights, clearly-lit pathways to the structure, and lockable disposal bins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaces should cater to every stage of the menstrual management journey, addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals who menstruate.
<ul>
<li>Individuals who menstruate highlighted that current solutions tend to prioritize one aspect of menstrual health management, such as the distribution of sanitary materials. Through a collaborative brainstorming session, we identified the essential features and components necessary for a comprehensive approach that covers all stages of menstrual management, including changing, bathing, washing, and proper disposal of products.</li>
<li>Tips for comprehensiveness at scale: Build spaces that integrate bathing shelters equipped with hooks, shelves, and a platform for bathing and laundering, a water source tap, and a disposal bin with a lock and an attached incinerator to ensure the complete destruction of products.

</ul>
</li>
<li>The value of a MH space will be measured by its material longevity.
<ul>
<li>Temporary or makeshift structures are prevalent in humanitarian settlements and are prone to rapid degradation. Through co-design, we learned that individuals who menstruate highly value and desire spaces that are durable, long-lasting, and seen as permanent in the community.</li>
<li>Tips for durability at scale: When possible, prioritize the use of robust materials like iron sheets for privacy walls, treated timber to protect against termites and rot, and bricks with enhanced mineral composition and stronger aggregate. Additionally, consider incorporating timber and mesh reinforcements for latrine pits to ensure long-term durability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community ownership fosters the long-term sustainability of MH spaces
<ul>
<li>During the co-design process, community ownership and responsibility emerged as a crucial aspect for ensuring the sustainability and acceptance of a Cocoon Mini from local stakeholders.</li>
<li>Tips for sustainability at scale: Involve local masons and community members in the construction and maintenance of the Mini spaces. This approach not only strengthens the sense of ownership, but also improves the longevity of the spaces and develops local expertise for future construction projects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Piloting the Cocoon Mini</h4>
<p>During the pilot phase, 20 Cocoon Minis were built within individual compounds in the settlement, each assigned a supervisor from the household for maintenance purposes. Overall, the 20 Cocoon Minis served an estimated 300 people, garnering significant desirability and acceptance within the community. <strong>An overwhelming 95% of participants expressed that the Cocoon Mini made managing menstrual health easier for them.</strong></p>
<p><em> </em><em>“The Mini has made MH easier because bathing is possible now with access to water, a disposal bin, and light to use at night hours.”</em> &#8211; Individual who menstruates, age 31</p>
<p>The Cocoon Mini pilot had many key achievements. Notably, there were no reported safety incidents throughout the pilot period, highlighting the effectiveness of the Minis in providing a safe, secure environment. Additionally, the Minis positively influenced mobility within the settlement, granting individuals the freedom to move around knowing they had dedicated spaces for managing their menstruation. This eliminated the need for them to return home and offered convenience and flexibility. Overall, the Cocoon Mini pilot successfully prioritized safety, improved hygiene practices, and enhanced mobility for individuals who menstruate in the community.</p>
<p><em> </em><em>“I can now bathe three times a day when menstruating because of easy access to water and the privacy of the bathroom. The one we had before had holes in it, so I was not able to bathe during the day due to fear that people may see me.”</em> &#8211; Individual who menstruates, age 15</p>

<h4>Thinking About Scale</h4>
<p>The scalability of the Cocoon Mini extends well beyond the Bidi Bidi Settlement, presenting numerous opportunities for co-designing solutions that cater to specific needs in different contexts. However, we emphasize the importance of adopting a holistic approach that combines both &#8220;hardware&#8221; (infrastructure) and &#8220;software&#8221; (social behavioral interventions) to ensure sustainable and lasting change. By integrating these two components, organizations can create comprehensive solutions that address the multifaceted nature of menstrual health management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips for holistic MH approach at scale: Consider conducting sensitivity training sessions with men, boys, and sanitation workers, as well as organizing educational forums on sexual and reproductive health. These initiatives can help prevent misinformation, raise awareness about menstrual health, STIs, and overall reproductive health, and foster a more inclusive and supportive environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>The Cocoon Mini project served as a successful proof of concept, showcasing the effectiveness of HCD methodology in co-designing MH interventions. By engaging individuals who menstruate and key community stakeholders, we developed a solution that addressed their priorities, including safety, privacy, holistic MH management, and sustainability.

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Yaqoob Muhammad will talk about his recently finished PhD in the presentation entitled &quot;The evolution, analysis and design of spiking neural networks for temporal pattern recognition&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>All sensory stimuli are temporal in structure. How a pattern of action potentials encodes
the information received from sensory stimuli is essential for the transmission and
interpretation of sensory information by the nervous system. Although it is clear that
information is carried by the number or the timing of spikes, the information processing
in the nervous system is poorly understood. One way to understand the mechanisms which
enable SNNs to perform a computational task is to associate the structural connectivity of
the network with the corresponding functional behavior. This work demonstrates the
structure-function mapping of small spiking networks evolved for recognizing temporal
patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-origin-giant-mystery-gecko">DNA has revealed the origin of this giant ‘mystery’ gecko</a></h4>

              
                <p>A lizard called Delcourt’s giant gecko has long been one of herpetology’s biggest mysteries — literally. </p>



<p>Presumed extinct, the animal is by far the largest gecko known to have crawled the Earth, measuring at least 600 millimeters, or about two feet, from snout to tail tip. The only example scientists have of the gecko, however, is a single <a href="https://musees.marseille.fr/le-gecko-geant-de-delcourt-du-museum-de-marseille-hoplodactylus-delcourti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">museum specimen</a>, preserved in the 19th century with no notes as to its origin or identity.</p>





<p>Now, DNA from the specimen reveals that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35210-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the colossal lizard belongs to a group of New Caledonian “diplodactylid” geckos</a>, researchers report June 19 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Geckos in this lineage repeatedly evolved extreme body sizes on the archipelago east of Australia.</p>



<p>“Compared to all other geckos, it’s monstrous,” says Matthew Heinicke, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. “It happens to be in a lineage where evolution of gigantism wasn’t a one-off event.”</p>

<p>Previously dubbed <em>Hoplodactylus delcourti</em>, the gecko was renamed <em>Gigarcanum delcourti</em> in the new study, placing the animal in its own genus whose name means “giant mystery.” It is about 50 percent as long and several times as heavy as the largest living gecko species (<em>Rhacodactylus leachianus</em>), also a member of the New Caledonian group.</p>



<p>Likely a nocturnal hunter,<em> G. delcourti</em> was big enough to prey on birds and lizards, including other geckos. Its toe pads and long claws suggest it lived in trees, though it was probably the maximum size at which a gecko&nbsp;could still adhere to vertical surfaces with its hallmark sticky grip, Heinicke says.</p>



<p>The gecko came to scientists’ attention in the 1980s after collections manager Alain Delcourt found the long-forgotten specimen at the Natural History Museum of Marseille in France. Stuffed rather than stored in spirits, the gecko sports a thick trunk, bulbous head and brown skin with faint red bands. Herpetologist Aaron Bauer of Villanova University in Pennsylvania was a graduate student when he arrived at the museum in 1983 to investigate the newly rediscovered specimen.</p>



<p>When Delcourt removed the enormous gecko from a cabinet, “my jaw dropped,” Bauer says.</p>



<p>Bauer cowrote the first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03014223.1986.10422655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">description</a> of the species in 1986, placing the reptile with a New Zealand gecko group based on its&nbsp;physical characteristics. He also suggested that because of its coloring and size, the gecko could be the <a href="https://www.theopennotebook.com/2012/02/23/ask-ton-edits-suggestions-or-demands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>kawekaweau</em></a> — a huge arboreal lizard from the folklore of the Indigenous Māori people.</p>

<p>Since then, techniques for retrieving and analyzing archival DNA have accelerated, allowing scientists to glean new information from degraded museum specimens, including of extinct species such as the dodo and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reviving-extinct-dna">thylacine</a>, also known as the Tasmanian tiger (<em>SN: 5/19/08</em>).</p>



<p>Heinicke, Bauer and colleagues revisited the mysterious giant gecko, extracting and analyzing DNA from one of its femurs. That genetic material rewrote <em>G. delcourti</em>’s origin story, showing that it is not even closely related to New Zealand’s geckos. The diplodactylid geckos of New Caledonia and New Zealand are separated by about 45 million years of evolution.</p>





<p>The team’s finding “turns things on their head,” as gecko geeks worldwide have long associated <em>G. delcourti</em> with New Zealand, says Paul Doughty, a herpetologist at the Western Australian Museum in Perth. “But this is the thing about these precious museum specimens. With new technology, they can give up new secrets.”</p>



<p>Not everyone is surprised by the finding. Trevor Worthy, a paleontologist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, previously suggested that <em>G. delcourti</em> may have come from New Caledonia, given its absence in New Zealand’s extensive fossil record. “You would think that … such a big animal would have turned up, and there was no sign of it,” Worthy says. “It’s exciting to see this mystery cleared up.”</p>



<p>Could <em>G. delcourti</em> still be nestled in the treetops of New Caledonia?</p>



<p>It’s unlikely, but possible, the researchers say. New geckos continue to be discovered on the islands. “I’d like to hold out at least a tiny glimmer of hope that there could be something out there,” Bauer says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-patagonia-duck-billed-dinosaurs">New fossils from Patagonia may rewrite the history of duck-billed dinosaurs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fossils from the southern tip of Chile are adding a wrinkle to researchers’ understanding of how duck-billed dinosaurs conquered the Cretaceous world.</p>



<p>Duck-billed dinos known as hadrosaurids were highly successful and lived on most continents by the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 million years ago. Now, a study shows that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg2456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an older duck-billed lineage</a> appears to have thrived some 72 million years ago in subantarctic South America, potentially millions of years before hadrosaurids reached the continent, researchers report June 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>“It’s yet another chapter in the dispersion of these dinosaurs that we did not know about,” says Jhonatan Alarcón-Muñoz, a paleontologist at the University of Chile in Santiago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About a decade ago, paleobiologist Marcelo Leppe of the Chilean Antarctic Institute in Punta Arenas was searching for plant fossils in the Río de las Chinas Valley in Chile’s Magallanes region when he spotted fossilized bones. After bringing the finding to the attention of Alexander Vargas, a paleontologist at the University of Chile, researchers extracted the bones for study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alarcón-Muñoz, Vargas, Leppe and their colleagues determined the bones belong to a new type of duck-billed dinosaur — herbivorous giants that had flattened, waterfowl-like snouts. The remains included many body parts, with pieces of hip, limbs, ribs, vertebrae and skull recovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers named the animal <em>Gonkoken nanoi</em>, “gon” and “koken” being the words for “similar to” and “wild duck or swan” in the language of the Indigenous Aónikenk people from the part of southern Patagonia where the bones were found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In all, the researchers suspect they found four distinct <em>Gonkoken</em> individuals. No remains of other animals were found with them, suggesting the dinosaurs were probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/duck-billed-dinosaurs-roamed-arctic-herds">moving in a herd</a>, Vargas says (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/9/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Gonkoken</em> isn’t like other known South American duck-billed dinosaurs, or like any from the old southern supercontinent of Gondwana, which included what came to be South America. Until now, all known duck-billed dinosaurs from Gondwana were hadrosaurids, which had their heyday in the late Cretaceous and had such efficient, stacked, plant-pulverizing teeth that they chewed their way to nearly global dominance, outcompeting other herbivorous dinosaur groups. <em>Gonkoken</em> appears to be part of an older, less specialized lineage that diverged from other duck-billed dinosaurs around 91 million years ago, before the first hadrosaurids evolved, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Gonkoken</em>’s ducklike snout had a simpler construction than that of hadrosaurids, Alarcón-Muñoz says, and it had fewer rows of teeth in its chewing surface. <em>Gonkoken</em> was also relatively small — about four meters long — while some hadrosaurids were true titans, reaching about 15 meters in length.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing a non-hadrosaurid duck-billed dinosaur in South America like <em>Gonkoken</em> is “somewhat unexpected,” says David Evans, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the research. The discovery “makes us rethink their biogeographic history in the Americas in interesting ways.”</p>



<p>For example, rather than a single colonization of the continent, the team thinks that duck-billed dinos arrived in South America from North America in two separate waves. “We suspect our kind of duck-billed dinosaur arrived earlier into South America and reached further south than the hadrosaurids,” says Alarcón-Muñoz, describing <em>Gonkoken</em> as a relict. “In most other places of the world, this kind of dinosaur had already gone extinct by this time.”</p>





<p>The findings may also mean that hadrosaurids were not quite as widespread as previously thought. Fragmentary remains in southern Patagonia and Antarctica that were thought to belong to hadrosaurids may actually be <em>Gonkoken</em> or its close relatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many other outcrops along the Río de las Chinas are studded with dinosaur bones. The researchers want to examine these to see if they belong to <em>Gonkoken</em> as well. &nbsp;Finding more skull bones of <em>Gonkoken</em>, Evans says, could be key for figuring out exactly how it was related to other duck-billed dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-tipping-trouble-climate-cerrado">The Amazon might not have a ‘tipping point.’ But it’s still in trouble</a></h4>

              
                <p>The shore of a sea of nearly 400 billion trees winds through the central Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. Here, the Amazon rainforest rubs up against the Cerrado, the world’s largest savanna.</p>



<p>The two are distinct worlds — one a wet and verdant jungle, the other relatively dry and blanketed in wild grasses, shrubs and small trees. But no clear line demarcates the Amazon and the Cerrado. Instead, there’s a messy transition zone, a continuum of vegetation that grows taller toward the rainforest. Over thousands of years, the boundary ebbs and flows, driven by natural fluctuations in climate.</p>





<p>“But in this formula is a new element,” says ecologist Beatriz Marimon of Mato Grosso State University in Nova Xavantina. Humans, with their ambitions to domesticate the land, she says.</p>



<p>About half a century ago, throngs of people started streaming into the region along new highways, clearing forest for farmland and cattle ranches, she says. Fifty years is a blink in the life span of a forest nearly as old as the dinosaurs, but it’s plenty of time for humans to remodel a landscape.</p>



<p>In 2007, earth system scientist Carlos Nobre, now at the University of São Paulo, and his colleagues suggested that much of the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL030612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon could transform into a savanna</a> if deforestation exceeded 40 percent of the forest’s original area, which was mostly whole before the 1970s. </p>



<p>About a decade later, after accounting for interactions between climate change, deforestation and fire, Nobre and a colleague offered a more dire warning. If <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat2340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 20 to 25 percent of the Amazon was deforested</a> and global warming reached about 2.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the ecosystem could collapse and much of the forest could transform into savanna and shrubland, they found. Today, humans have already deforested about 17 percent of the overall Amazon, and damaged much more, estimates suggest.</p>

<p>That the Amazon may transform into something else after reaching a point at which it cannot cope with exacerbating conditions — a “tipping point” — has raised alarms. Such a shift would imperil the forest’s storied biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions of people. It would also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-could-flip-parts-amazon-carbon-sponge-source-2050">release immense volumes of carbon dioxide</a> and alter the global circulation of heat, vastly complicating efforts to slow climate change (<em>SN Online: 1/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>The Amazon is in grave trouble, scientists agree. Human activities and climate change are exacerbating the dry season; in some areas, it lasts four to five weeks longer than decades ago. Fires have also become more fierce. All of that is stressing the forest out.</p>



<p>But much like the physical transition separating the Amazon from the Cerrado, the forest’s limit is probably not defined by a single, clear tipping point, many scientists now say. The Amazon is no monolith. Different parts may react to threats in different ways, Marimon says.</p>





<p>A multitude of poorly understood factors affect the forest’s fate: The myriad forms of human actions. Climate change. The diverse capabilities and adaptations of plants. The ambit of underground water.</p>



<p>Ongoing research is clarifying if, when and where conditions may push the forest beyond its limits, and could help inform efforts to save the forest from potential widespread dieback. These are urgent tasks, as it’s not yet clear how much time may remain to save the forest, or if it’s already at the brink of some irreversible shift, says Matt Finer, director of the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project, or MAAP, based in Washington, D.C. In either case, he says, “we’re kind of probably the last ones with the option to ponder that.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Felling the Amazon</h4>



<p>Ecologically speaking, the Amazon is without equal. It accounts for more than half of Earth’s remaining tropical forests, through which roughly 17 percent of the world’s river water flows. It also houses about 1 in 4 of the world’s land-dwelling species. That unfathomable bonanza includes its flowers: More types of flowers bloom in the Amazon than there are stars visible to the naked eye in the night sky. What’s more, each year the rainforest absorbs about 5 percent of the world’s annual CO<sub>2</sub><strong> </strong>emissions from fossil fuel burning and land use changes, with its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">carbon reserves</a> weighing as much as 230 million blue whales (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>Much of this vitality is sustained by the trade winds, which blow east to west across the forest from the Atlantic Ocean. The winds carry sea-born moisture into the eastern parts of the forest, where it precipitates. Once fallen, some of this water evaporates back into the air. Much of it soaks into the soil. It’s absorbed by roots, courses up through plant stems and tree trunks, and is then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forest-trees-reduce-global-warming-climate-cooling-carbon">transpired through leaves</a> back to the sky (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 9</em>). A single tree in the Amazon can pump 500 liters of water into the atmosphere each day.</p>



<p>Winds whisk the moisture hundreds of kilometers deeper into the forest, where it rains on more trees. A single molecule of water may repeat this cycle more than five times before exiting the forest basin. The Amazon waters itself.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The rainforest as rainmaker</h3>



<p>Winds carry moisture into the eastern Amazon, where it falls as rain. Much of it soaks into the soil, where some water is taken up by roots and ultimately transpired through leaves back into the air. Winds then carry this moisture deeper into the forest, where the cycle repeats (left). But cutting down trees reduces the water taken up by roots and evapotranspiration (right). That breaks the cycle, increasing local runoff and reducing rainfall in the interior.</p>

<p>But this arrangement has vulnerabilities. If enough of the forest’s eastern expanses are cut down, moisture may run off and out of the basin rather than sail into deeper sections of the forest that need it, Finer says. “That deforestation cuts off the whole system.”</p>



<p>Already, <a href="https://maaproject.org/2022/amazon-tipping-point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 30 percent of the Amazon’s eastern third</a> has been cleared, Finer and colleagues reported in a 2022 MAAP report. Deforestation averaged across the whole forest may not yet have crossed that 20 to 25 percent threshold, but “in that eastern third, it’s way worse,” Finer says. If that destructive trend continues in the east, it could decapitate the Amazon’s skyborne streams of moisture, he says. Finer doesn’t think the forest has yet crossed a tipping point, but, like other scientists, stresses it could be hard to know for years.</p>



<p>Even if this rain recycling goes bust, the forest’s western region — about a third of its expanse — could still hold out. This area is backed by the towering Andes, which wring westbound winds of water and ensure that heavy rain falls upon nearby forests. The area’s lush vegetation shouldn’t suffer too terribly from distant deforestation, Nobre says.</p>



<p>Deforestation doesn’t just harm the tracts where trees are felled. The warming and drying that follow in deforestation’s wake may spill over into the edges of intact forests nearby, affecting which plant and animal species persist there. That’s one of the many ways forests become degraded, a condition that’s often less obvious than outright clear-cutting.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it’s pervasive. About 38 percent of the remaining <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon rainforest has been degraded</a>, researchers reported in January in <em>Science</em>. That’s an area equivalent to nearly a third of Brazil, or more than three times the size of Texas.</p>



<p>Degradation can take many forms, with repercussions that vary depending on the damage’s nature, intensity and scope. Fires can raze parts of the rainforest. If the burned land is left alone, Amazon plants typically return on their own, bursting forth from seeds and roots in the soil. But severe fires can destroy these buried remnants too, denying some species the chance to return. As such, the forests that grow back often lack the diversity of their predecessors. Where humans have repeatedly burned the land in the past, the forest may recover more slowly and be dominated by just a few fire-resistant species even after two decades.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, selective logging can open a forest’s closed canopy, ushering in sunlight to heat and dry the understory, killing some plants, exacerbating fires and pushing out animals.</p>



<p>Where degradation reduces vegetation, it shrivels transpiration. For each leaf lost, the forest’s moisture loses one little gate back into the sky. During a typical dry season, severely degraded forests may release 34 percent less water back to the sky. That loss directly sabotages the forest’s rain recycling, imperiling trees that depend upon it.</p>



<p>Because degradation can unfold in so many ways, computer simulations that project changes in the Amazon’s vegetation cannot say exactly how it may contribute to a tipping point.</p>



<p>“It’s logical to think that such degradation helps push the system towards the tipping point, if it really exists,” says earth system scientist David Lapola of the University of Campinas in Brazil. But “we can’t today say this percentage of degradation will make the system tip to another stable state.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A drier future</h4>



<p>The Amazon isn’t just dealing with deforestation and degradation, of course. Over the last 50 years, the average annual temperature across the forest has climbed <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00228/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 0.6 degrees C</a>. And exceptionally severe droughts have struck the forest three times in the last two decades. Some climate models suggest that by 2060, such extreme drought conditions could occur as often as 9 in every 10 years.</p>



<p>Recent climate simulations suggest that if such drought years became the new “climate normal,” patches of the rainforest may transition to a different state — whether that be savanna or a more open or dry forest — at different times, not all at once.</p>



<p>Some of these localized shifts could trigger a domino effect, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2120777119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing nearby areas to also shift</a>, researchers reported last year in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The Amazon’s southeastern forest appears to be highly vulnerable to local diebacks, while areas downwind to the west seem to be liable to the domino effect.</p>



<p>Projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, which coordinates and standardizes climate projections, also point to localized Amazon diebacks. For a 2022 study, researchers examined projections from <a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phase-6-cmip6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sixth phase of the project, or CMIP6</a>, analyzing models that simulate the response of vegetation to climate change. Five of the seven analyzed CMIP6 models indicate that the risk of sudden, local diebacks will climb as the world reaches and surpasses 1.5 degrees C of global warming above preindustrial levels.</p>



<p>But no two projections completely agree. Even when the same amount of climate change is assumed, CMIP6 models produce different pathways, with diebacks occurring at different points. One model predicts diebacks could begin around 1.3 degrees C of warming, another at about 1.7 degrees C.</p>



<p>The lack of agreement comes in part because these models — and others used to predict the Amazon’s fate — make different assumptions about the complex nature of the world’s greatest rainforest.</p>



<p>Taking a closer look at that complexity may reveal ways in which the forest is more — or less — resilient than we think.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hidden nuance in the trees</h4>



<p>Often, talk of “the Amazon” evokes visions of dense, dripping vines and trees. But the forest is actually a messy medley of ecosystems. There are the vivacious várzeas — floodplains occupied by dense forests, grasslands and swamps that, for months of the year, become inundated under nutrient-rich water, which sustain an abundance of fauna and flora.</p>



<p>The várzea’s uliginous counterpart, the igapós, consists of swamp forests that also flood seasonally, though with nutrient-poor waters as dark as maté, steeped in tannins leached from decaying plants. Igapó trees grow slowly, but they grow dense and excel at sequestering carbon.</p>



<p>Then there are the diverse terra firme, the tall, thick, closed canopy jungles that cover the uplands, above the flood line. Even naturally occurring white-sand savannas can be found within the Amazon’s borders. As for trees, roughly 230 species are thought to dominate the forest, while <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1243092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 16,000 species have been cataloged</a> in the basin.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, research projects often simulate the Amazon’s vegetation as relatively homogenous, says earth system scientist Marina Hirota of the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis, Brazil. They cast every tree as a broadleaf evergreen tree, the forest as a monoculture. These simplified simulations, called “big leaf” models, prevail because researchers lack data, Hirota says, but the models don’t do the forest justice.</p>



<p>Over millions of years, the forest’s myriad plant communities have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved differently to cope with local rainfall pattern</a>s. Research suggests that projections may not fully capture how the lush diversity of plant traits affects the Amazon’s ability to endure and adapt to stress like climate change–induced droughts.</p>

<p>Take for instance, embolism resistance. When soils dry, plants may inadvertently suck bubbles of air into their vascular systems, causing a sometimes-lethal blockage called an embolism. Tree species inhabiting the more drought-prone central eastern Amazon tend to grow slower but be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05971-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more resistant to embolism</a> and vascular collapse than species in the forest’s west. Hirota, Marimon and their colleagues reported this finding in April in <em>Nature</em> after studying 129 tree species from 11 plots across the Amazon. The work suggests rainfall patterns have shaped plant communities’ capacities to cope with drought.</p>



<p>Then, there’s what lies underground — the groundwater — which is poorly captured by many simulations. Most investigations into the forest’s response to drought have focused on upland areas overlying deep water tables, which roots struggle to access. But about half of the Amazon may stand atop a relatively shallow water table. That accessible groundwater could sustain plants through droughts in ways that models don’t account for, says ecologist Flávia Costa of Brazil’s National Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus.</p>



<p>Such areas could serve as drought refugia, Costa says: “Places that do not suffer.” But if drought gets too severe and groundwater recedes beyond the reach of roots, refuges could become ruinous. “Those places may be the ones that suffer the most because the plants are not adapted” to dry conditions, she says.</p>



<p>Hirota, Marimon and others are still studying how Amazonian plants are coping with drought to amass more information about what Hirota calls plants’ “life strategies.” The goal is to use the data to improve existing vegetation models and simulate more accurately the diverse responses to climate change and land use changes.</p>



<p>This research, and other investigations into the many capabilities and adaptations of the Amazon’s plants, will be necessary to better inform projections of the Amazon’s fate, Hirota says. The same, Costa says, goes for the influence of groundwater.</p>



<p>A third source of uncertainty in figuring out the Amazon’s fate wafts invisibly through the air. Researchers had previously suggested that an atmosphere richer in CO<sub>2</sub> might boost the forest’s growth, potentially offsetting some of the tolls of climate change. Some experts had even proposed that this “atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization” could preclude a massive forest dieback.</p>



<p>But CO<sub>2</sub> and sunlight aren’t all that’s needed for growth. Plants also consume nutrients from soils, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-created-amazon-dark-earth">Amazonian soils are notoriously lacking</a>, especially in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphorus-earth-earliest-life-forged-lightning-chemistry">phosphorus</a> (<em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 10</em>;<em> SN: 4/10/21, p. 7</em>). Using computer simulations for a 2019 study, Lapola and colleagues found that a dearth of phosphorus would probably reduce the projected growth gains associated with more abundant CO<sub>2</sub> by about 50 percent over 15 years. The team’s conclusion: Previous projections may have overestimated the benefits of extra carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>No large-scale experiments have yet tested the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization on the Amazon. But Lapola and colleagues have almost finished constructing steel towers that will spray carbon dioxide over mature groves in the Amazon, to see how the trees respond. It may still take years to acquire meaningful results.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What comes next?</h4>



<p>At this point, scientists don’t have enough information to say when, or if, the Amazon will cross some threshold beyond which it becomes unrecognizable, Lapola says. Today’s computer models are trying to open doors into the future, to peer beyond thresholds and see what’s ahead for the Amazon. But with the data available today, “we’re looking into a room from the hole of the lock.”</p>



<p>That a web of local diebacks could unravel across the forest is worrisome, but that fragmented fate may carry more hope than a single catastrophic switch, Hirota says. For one, it could help dissuade people from writing the forest off as a lost cause after crossing some predicted limit.</p>



<p>Resignation is a serious concern, Nobre says. “If we take for granted that the tipping point has already been exceeded, then people say forget it.”</p>



<p>Nobre aims to restore some of the forest’s most deforested areas, to tilt the Amazon away from that momentous tip, or to at least rein in the lengthening of the dry season. He and others have called for extensive reforesting along what they call arcs of restoration. “One arc over the southern Amazon, another one along the Andes,” he says. Such work hasn’t yet begun.</p>



<p>Even if it does, restoration alone cannot succeed if deforestation and degradation continue. It takes far less time to timber a tree than to grow one.</p>



<p>Not all human activity has harmed the forest. People from Indigenous groups have acted as stewards of the forest’s biodiversity for millennia. Plants that they domesticated long ago, such as Brazil nut trees and umari trees, are still abundant in some areas near ancient settlements. Today, Indigenous territories as well as protected areas make up more than half of the forest in the Brazilian Amazon. Since 2000, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-01018-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 5 percent of forest loss</a> has occurred on these grounds. Working with the people living in these areas to stave off further deforestation and degradation will be key, researchers say.</p>



<p>But the forest’s fate will depend on more than restoration and conservation efforts in South America. Greenhouse gases emitted by nations around the world are driving many of the challenges the Amazon faces.</p>



<p>And Marimon implores people to stop buying Amazonian beef and other products that fuel the engine of deforestation. Around 75 percent of the land deforested in the Amazon is used as pastures for grazing cattle, and Brazil is now the world’s largest exporter of beef.</p>

<p>Taking real steps to change behavior is in the best interest of all who call this planet home. Beyond the Amazon’s irreplaceable biodiversity, beyond its colossal carbon stores, there are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-teleconnections-droughts-fires">wind and ocean currents</a> that connect the forest to regions across the globe (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 9</em>). Amazonian temperature anomalies have been linked to anomalies in the Tibetan Plateau, where glaciers that supply around 2 billion people with drinking water are shrinking, and to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.</p>



<p>Back in Mato Grosso, Marimon suspects that the changes she’s witnessed there could eventually unfold across much of the Amazon. Year after year, more trees disappear and the air is getting hotter. Insects that once buzzed about in throngs have vanished. And in some places, the piercing shrieks of the capitão da mata — an iconic, vociferous bird — have vanished. Shrieks that warned to all who heard them: Danger is afoot.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-mechanics-sound-split-phonon">Physicists split bits of sound using quantum mechanics</a></h4>

              
                <p>You can’t divide the indivisible, unless you use quantum mechanics. Physicists have now turned to quantum effects to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg8715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split phonons</a>, the smallest bits of sound, researchers report in the June 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>It’s a breakthrough that mirrors the sort of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-entanglement-communication-security-bell-test">quantum weirdness</a> that’s typically demonstrated with light or tiny particles like electrons and atoms (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>). The achievement may one day lead to sound-based versions of quantum computers or extremely sensitive measuring devices. For now, it shows that mind-bending quantum weirdness applies to sound as well as it does to light.</p>





<p>“There was no one that had really explored that,” says engineering physicist Andrew Cleland of the University of Chicago. Doing so allows researchers “to draw parallels between sound waves and light.”</p>



<p>Phonons have much in common with photons, the tiniest chunks of light. Turning down the volume of a sound is the same as dialing back the number of phonons, much like dimming a light reduces the number of photons. The very quietest sounds of all consist of individual — and indivisible — phonons.</p>



<p>Unlike photons, which can travel through empty space, phonons need a medium such as air or water — or in the case of the new study, the surface of an elastic material. “What&#8217;s really kind of, in my mind, amazing about that is that these sound waves [carry] a very, very small amount of energy, because it&#8217;s a single quantum,” Cleland says. “But it involves the motion of a quadrillion atoms that are all working together to [transmit] this sound wave.”</p>



<p>Phonons can’t be permanently broken into smaller bits. But, as the new experiment showed, they can be temporarily divided into parts using quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>Cleland and his team managed the feat with an acoustic beam splitter, a device that allows about half of an impinging torrent of phonons to pass through while the rest get reflected back. But when just one phonon at a time meets the beam splitter, that phonon enters a special quantum state where it goes both ways at once. The simultaneously reflected and transmitted phonon interacts with itself, in a process known as interference, to change where it ultimately ends up.</p>



<p>The lab demonstration of the effect relied on sound millions of times higher in pitch than humans can hear, in a device cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero. Instead of speakers and microphones to create and hear the sound, the team used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-designer-molecules-quantum-device-qubit">qubits</a>, which store quantum bits of information (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>). The researchers launched a phonon from one qubit toward another qubit. Along the way, the phonon encountered a beam splitter.</p>



<p>Adjusting the parameters of the setup modified the way that the reflected and transmitted portions of the phonon interacted with each other. That allowed the researchers to quantum mechanically change the odds of the whole phonon turning up back at the qubit that launched the phonon or at the qubit on the other side of the beam splitter.</p>



<p>A second experiment confirmed the quantum mechanical behavior of the phonons by sending phonons from two qubits to a beam splitter between them. On their own, each phonon could end up back at the qubit it came from or at the one on the opposite side of the beam splitter. </p>



<p>If the phonons were timed to arrive at the beam splitter at the exact same time, though, they travel together to their ultimate destination. That is, they still unpredictably go to one qubit or the other, but they always end up at the same qubit when the two phonons hit the beam splitter simultaneously.</p>



<p>If phonons followed the classical, nonquantum rules for sound, then there would be no correlation in where the two phonons go after hitting the beam splitter. The effect could serve as the basis for fundamental building blocks in quantum computers known as gates.</p>





<p>“The next logical step in this experiment is to demonstrate that we can do a quantum gate with phonons,” Cleland says. “That would be one gate in the assembly of gates that you need to do an actual computation.”</p>



<p>Sound-based devices are not likely to outperform <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">quantum computers that use photons</a> (<em>SN: 2/14/18</em>). But phonons could lead to new quantum applications, says Andrew Armour, a physicist at the University of Nottingham in England who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s probably not so clear what those [applications] are at the moment,” Armour says. “What you&#8217;re doing is extending the [quantum] toolbox…. People will build on it, and it will keep going, and there&#8217;s no sign of it stopping any time soon.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-xi-why-large-language-models-are-not-conscious/">Notes on consciousness. (XI) Why large language models are not conscious</a></h4>

              
                <p>The current discussions about AI are plagued
with anthropomorphism. Of course, the name “artificial intelligence” has
probably something to do with the matter. A conscious artificial intelligence might
sound like science-fiction, but a sentient statistical model certainly sounds a
bit more bizarre. In this post, I want to address the following question: are
large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, or more generally deep learning
models, conscious? (perhaps just a little bit?)</p>



<p>The first thing that must be realized is that
the question of what it takes for something to be conscious is a very old
question, which has been the subject of considerable work in the past. The
opinions and arguments that we read today are not original. Very often, they
unknowingly repeat common arguments that have been discussed at length in the
past. It might seem for the general public or AI engineers that the spectacular
successes of modern AI programs should bring a new light on these old
questions, but that is not really the case. These spectacular programs already
existed 50 years ago, just as thought experiments: which for logical arguments
makes no difference at all. For example, in 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Searle
articulated an argument</a> against the idea that a
program that seems to behave like a human would necessarily have a mind. The
argument was based on a thought experiment, where an average English-speaking
person would apply the operations of a sophisticated program that takes a
question written in Chinese as input and outputs an answer in Chinese. Searle
argues that while that person is able to have a conversation in Chinese by
mechanically applying rules, she does not understand Chinese. Therefore, he
concludes, understanding cannot be identified with the production of acceptable
answers. Now such programs exist, and their existence does not change anything
to either the argument or the objections that have been raised then. All these
discussions were precisely based on the premises that such systems would exist.</p>



<p>This is an important preamble: a <em>lot</em>
has been said and written about consciousness, what it means, what it takes for
something to be conscious, etc. Answers to these questions are not to be found
in current AI research but in the philosophy literature, and whether a program
produces convincing answers to questions, or can correctly categorize images,
bears very little relevance to any of these discussions. A corollary is that AI
engineering skills provide no particular authority on the subject of AI
consciousness, and indeed, as far as I can tell, many arguments we hear in the
AI community on this subject tend be rather naïve, or at least not original and
with known weaknesses.</p>



<p>Another important remark is that, while there
is a lot of literature on the subject, there is no consensus whatsoever in the
specialized community on those questions. Views on consciousness go from
consciousness does not exist (eliminativism/illusionism) to everything is
conscious (panpsychism(s)). In my view, there is no consensus because there is currently
no convincing theory of consciousness (some say that there can be no theory of
consciousness, which is another proposition on which there is no consensus).
There are good reasons for this state of affair, which I scratched <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-explained-with-sex/">here</a> and <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-x-why-i-am-not-a-panpsychist-reading-notes-on-philip-goffs-galileos-error/">there</a> (and others have too, obviously).</p>



<p>This remark is important because I have seen
it become an argument for why a particular artefact <em>might</em> be conscious: we
don’t know what consciousness is exactly, or what it takes for something to be
conscious, therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that something in
particular is conscious.</p>



<p>However, this is a fallacy. We do not know
what it takes for an entity to be conscious, but we certainly do know that
certain entities <em>cannot</em> be conscious, if the meaning we give to this
notion must have some vague resemblance with its usual meaning.</p>



<p>Now, I will make a few general points against
the idea that LLMs, or more generally formal deep neural networks, are
conscious, by discussing the concept of a “conscious state” (i.e., “how it
feels like now”).</p>



<p>Once we remove the buzzwords, such as
“intelligence”, “learning”, etc., a modern deep learning model is essentially a
massively parallel differentiable program. In effect, it is essentially a tensor
calculator, the state of which is updated by a series of iterations.</p>



<p>The default assumption in the computational
view of mind is that a mental state is something like a program state. But a
conscious state is a very particular kind of state. First of all, a conscious
state has a subject (the entity that is conscious) and an object (what it is
about). Both relate to well-known topics in philosophy of mind, namely the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/">unity of consciousness</a> and the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-intentionality/">intentionality</a> of consciousness.</p>



<p>When we wonder whether something is conscious,
that thing is typically an organism, or a machine, or even, if you adopt <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-x-why-i-am-not-a-panpsychist-reading-notes-on-philip-goffs-galileos-error/">panpsychism</a>, a rock or an atom. But we could
consider many other combinations of molecules and ask whether they are
conscious. How about the entity made of a piece of my finger (still attached to
my body) plus two coins in a fountain in Rome? This seems absurd, but why? There
is a reason why: two objects that do not interact at all have the same
properties whether we look at them one by one or together. New properties above
the individual elements can only arise if there is some kind of interaction
between the elements. So, if neither my finger nor any of the coins is
conscious, then the combination is not conscious either. Thus, we can say that
a necessary condition for a set of components to constitute a subject is that
there is some causal integration between the components. This is actually the
basis of one particular theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory
(which I have criticized <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-ix-why-integrated-information-theory-fails/">here</a>, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/qd4z9">there</a> and <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/modern-panpsychism-about-the-integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/">there</a>, essentially because a necessary condition is
not a sufficient condition). If a deep learning network is conscious, then
which layer is the subject?</p>



<p>I leave this tricky question hanging there to address the more critical ones (but in case you want to dig, look up these keywords: <a href="http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f17/phil204A/readings/Varela%201979%20Principles%20of%20Biological%20Autonomy.part1.pdf">autonomy of the living</a>, biological organism, biological agency). One is the question of intentionality: the fact that a conscious state is about something: I am conscious of something in particular. A large language model is a symbol processing system. The problem is that it is humans who give meaning to symbols. The program is fed with sequences of bits, and outputs sequences of bits. If one asks an LLM “What is the color of a banana?” and the LLM replies “yellow”, does the program understand what a banana is? Clearly, it doesn’t have the visual experience of imagining a banana. It has never seen a banana. It doesn’t experience the smell or touch of a banana. All it does is output 0100, which we have decided stands for the word banana, when we input a particular stream of numbers. But the particular numbers are totally arbitrary: we could choose to assign a different sequence of numbers to each of the words and we would still interpret the computer’s output in exactly the same way, even though the program would now have different inputs and outputs. So, if the program has a conscious experience, then it is about nothing in particular: therefore, there is no conscious experience at all.</p>



<p>This is known as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_grounding_problem">symbol grounding problem</a>”, again a well-known problem (which I examined in the context of “<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">neural codes</a>”). Many people consider that a necessary ingredient has to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition">embodiment</a>, that is, the idea that the machine has to have a body interacting with the world (but again, careful, necessary does not mean sufficient). It seems that it is Yann Le Cun’s position, for example. Again, it is not clear at all what it takes for something to be conscious, but it is clear that there can be no conscious experience at all unless that experience is somehow about something, and so the symbol grounding problem must be addressed.</p>



<p>These are well-known problems in philosophy of
mind. The final point I want to discuss here is more subtle. It relates to the
notion of “state”. In computationalism (more generally, functionalism), a
conscious state is a sort of program state. But there is a big confusion here. Both
terminologies use the word “state”, but their meaning is completely different.
A state of mind, an experience, is not at all a “state” in the physical sense
of pressure, volume and so on, that is, the configuration of a system. Consider
a visual experience. Can it be the case that to see something is to have the
brain in a certain state? For example, some neurons in the inferotemporal
cortex fire when a picture of Jennifer Anniston is presented: is the visual
experience of Jennifer Anniston the same as the active state of the neuron? If
the answer is positive, then why should you have the experience, rather than
that neuron? Otherwise, perhaps the neuron <em>triggers</em> the experience, but
then we need to assign the experience to the state of some downstream neurons
and we face the problem of infinite regress.</p>



<p>The issue is that an experience is simply not
a physical state; to treat it as such is a category error. To see this,
consider this thought experiment, which I called the “<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9">Bewitched thought experiment</a>” (self-quote):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>In the TV series Bewitched, Samantha the housewife twitches her nose and everyone freezes except her. Then she twitches her nose and everyone unfreezes, without noticing that anything happened. For them, time has effectively stopped. Was anyone experiencing anything during that time? According to the encoding view of conscious experience, yes: one experiences the same percept during the entire time, determined by the unchanging state of the brain. But this seems wrong, and indeed in the TV series the characters behave as if there had been no experience at all during that time.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>It would seem bizarre that people experience
something when their brain state is maintained fixed. That is because to experience
is an <em>activity</em>, not a thing. Therefore, a system cannot experience
something just by virtue of being in some state. The vector of activation
states of a neural network is not a conscious “state”. It is not even false: it
is a category error. So, when a deep network outputs a symbol that we associate
to Jennifer Anniston, it doesn’t actually <em>see</em> Jennifer Anniston. Having
the output “neuron” in a particular state is not an experience, let alone an
experience <em>of</em> seeing Jennifer Anniston.</p>



<p>All these remarks, which tend to show that the
application of tensor calculus does not produce conscious experience, can be
perplexing because it is hard to imagine what else could possibly produce
conscious experience. Current “artificial intelligence” is our best shot so far
at mimicking consciousness, and I am saying that it is not even a little bit
conscious. So, what else could consciousness be then?</p>



<p>My honest answer is: I don’t know. Will we
know someday? I also don’t know. Should it be possible, hypothetically, to
build a conscious artifact? Maybe, but I don’t know (but why not? I don’t know,
how then? I also don’t know). I wish I did know, but I don’t find it particularly
bizarre that certain things are still unexplained and unclear. It doesn’t mean
that there’s nothing interesting to be said on consciousness.</p>



<p>But in any case, I want to point out that the
“what else” argument is a self-destructive argument. Asking “what else?” is
just admitting that you have no logical argument that allows you to prove your
proposition. This is not an argument, but rather an admission of failure (which
is fine).</p>



<p>Anyway: I don’t know what it takes for
something to be conscious, but I think we can be fairly confident that LLMs or
deep networks are not conscious.</p>
