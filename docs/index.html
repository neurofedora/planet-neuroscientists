              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bee-honeybees-waggle-dance-communicate-lessons-learn-hive">Honeybees waggle to communicate. But to do it well, they need dance lessons</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a castaway test setup, groups of young honeybees figuring out how to forage on their own start waggle dancing spontaneously — but badly.</p>



<p>Waggling matters. A honeybee’s rump-shimmy runs and turning loops encode clues that help her colony mates fly to food she has found, sometimes kilometers away. However, five&nbsp; colonies in the new test had no older sisters or half-sisters around as role models for getting the dance moves right.</p>



<p>Still, dances improved in some ways as the youngsters wiggled and looped day after day, reports behavioral ecologist James Nieh of the University of California, San Diego. But when waggling the clues for distance information, <em>Apis mellifera</em> without role models never did match the timing and coding in normal colonies where young bees practiced with older foragers before doing the main waggle themselves.</p>





<p>The youngsters-only colonies thus show that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade1702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social learning, or the lack of it, matters for communicating by dance</a> among honeybees, Nieh and an international team of colleagues say in the March 10 <em>Science</em>. Bee waggle dancing, a sort of language, turns out to be both innate and learned, like songbird or human communication.</p>



<p>The dance may appear simple in a diagram, but executing it on expanses of honeycomb cells gets challenging. Bees are “running forward at over one body length per second in the pitch black trying to keep the correct angle, surrounded by hundreds of bees that are crowding them,” Nieh says.</p>



<p>Beekeepers and biologists know that some kinds of bees can learn from others of their kind — some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/score-bumblebees-football-insect-social-learning">bumblebees even tried soccer</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/17</em>). But when it comes to waggle dancing, “I think people have assumed it’s genetic,” Nieh says. That would make this fancy footwork more like the chatty but innate communications of cuttlefish color change, for instance. The lab bee-castaway experiments instead show a nonhuman example of “social learning for sophisticated communication,” Nieh says.</p>



<p>Testing for social learning took some elaborate beekeeping. At an apiary research center in Kunming, China, researchers put thousands of nearly grown-up honeybees (at what’s called the purple-eyed pupae stage) into incubators and then collected the brand-new winged adults when they emerged.</p>



<p>These youngsters went into five weirdly populated colonies of same-age worker newbies. Each colony got a queen, who would lay eggs but not leave the colony to forage. Food had to come from the young workforce, with no older, experienced foragers buzzing in and dancing the locations of flowers.</p>



<p>In waggle dancing, foraging bees have to master not only the moves but the obstacles of the honeycomb dance floor. A cell may be empty. “It’s just the edges to hang on to…. It would be easy to stumble,” Nieh says. Unlike commercial hives with manufactured uniform honeycomb cells, natural combs “are very irregular,” he says. “Along the edges, they get a bit crazy and rough.”</p>

<p>Dances on these treacherous surfaces encode the food’s direction in the angle a dancer waggles across the comb (measured relative to gravity). Duration of waggling bout gives a clue on how far away the bonanza is.</p>





<p>The five colonies of castaways were left to figure out dancing on their own, in contrast to five other colonies in the apiary with a natural mix. Early in the experiments, researchers recorded and analyzed the first dances of five bees from each hive.</p>



<p>Even in the mixed-age hives, the dancers didn’t get the angle perfect every time. The extremes in a set of six waggle runs might differ by a bit more than 30 degrees. The castaway hives, though, had far more trouble at first. Two of the five castaway dancers’ angles veered more than 50 degrees apart, and one poor bee strayed more than 60 degrees in six repeats.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Waggle dancing lets honeybees share news about where to find food. The honeybee marked with a purple dot that’s making irregular figure eight loops in the center did not have older, experienced foragers around to lead her in practice dances. As a result, her first dance is rough and other bees seem to be colliding with her as much as following her. A study comparing bees with and without dance mentors suggests that this sophisticated communication is a mix of innate and learned behavior.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the castaways got more experience, they got better though. Repeating the test with the same marked bees a few weeks later near the end of their lives found them angling about as well as dancers in a normal hive.</p>



<p>What the castaways didn’t change much were dance features that encode distance to food. Researchers had set up the hives so that all would have the same experience of flying the distance to a feeder. Yet castaway bees persisted in dancing as if it were farther.</p>



<p>They gave more rump wags per waggle run (closer to five wags) than bees from mixed-age hives (more like 3.5 wags). The youngsters also took longer on each run.</p>



<p>Evidence like this foraging study is “indeed accumulating for the importance of learning (whether individual or social) in the complex behaviors of bees,” insect ecophysiologist Tamar Keasar of the University of Haifa in Israel says in an email. In her own work, she sees bees learning to extract food from complicated flowers. Bees aren’t, after all, just little automatons with wings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkey-stone-flakes-ancient-hominid-tools">Some monkeys accidentally make stone flakes that resemble ancient hominid tools</a></h4>

              
                <p>Monkeys in southern Thailand use rocks to pound open oil palm nuts, inadvertently shattering stone pieces off their makeshift nutcrackers. These flakes resemble some sharp-edged stone tools presumed to have been created on purpose by ancient hominids, researchers say.</p>



<p>Thailand’s long-tailed macaques (<em>Macaca fascicularis</em>) produce shards that could easily be mistaken for stone flakes previously found at 17 East African hominid sites dating from about 3.3 million to 1.56 million years ago, say archaeologist Tomos Proffitt and colleagues. The finding suggests that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade8159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ancient hominids may sometimes have created the stone flakes by accident</a> while using rocks to smash nuts, bones or other objects, the scientists report March 10 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Previous research has already shown that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-monkeys-throw-curve-stone-tool-makings-origins">rock-wielding capuchin monkeys in Brazil</a> unwittingly produce hominid-like stone flakes (<em>SN: 10/19/16</em>).</p>



<p>Observations of rock bashing by these two monkey species undermine a long-standing assumption that hominids must have intentionally made certain ancient stone flakes, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-genus-earliest-stone-tool-artifacts-ethiopia-contested">some of the earliest known examples of tools</a>, Proffitt says (<em>SN: 6/3/19</em>). It’s time to reevaluate how such determinations are made, he contends.</p>



<p>Proffitt’s group identified 219 complete and fragmented stone flakes at 40 macaque nut-cracking sites on the island where the monkeys live. The team also found rocks showing damage consistent with having been used either as pounding implements or pounding platforms.</p>

<p>Some differences do exist between macaque and hominid stone flakes, says Proffitt, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. For instance, many macaque flakes display battering damage on only one side, versus frequent two-sided damage on hominid artifacts.</p>



<p>Such clues may help archaeologists develop guidelines for estimating whether ancient hominids made stone flakes on purpose or by accident, Proffitt suspects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammogram-dense-breast-cancer">My mammogram revealed I have dense breasts. What does that mean?</a></h4>

              
                <p>After a mammogram, you may have gotten a letter in the mail that starts something like this: “Your mammogram indicates that you have dense breast tissue.” When I got that letter, I wasn’t sure what it meant for me or what, if anything, I should do about it. Off the letter went to a stack of other “nonurgent” mail to think about later.</p>



<p>Later has turned into now. That’s because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/10/2023-04550/mammography-quality-standards-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new rule on breast density notifications</a>, part of an update to mammography regulations. Published March 10, the rule makes these letters a nationwide requirement and standardizes the information conveyed in them. Previously, 38 states notified people with dense breasts or provided information about breast density after a mammogram. The new rule, which goes into effect September 10, 2024, means everyone who has had a mammogram will be informed whether their breasts are dense or not.</p>





<p>Why do people need to know this? If you just want the take-home message, here it is: Having dense breasts modestly increases the risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer. But breast density is just <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2737316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one factor among others to be considered</a> when figuring out a person’s overall risk. Having dense breasts doesn’t mean you will get breast cancer, and not having dense breasts doesn’t mean you’re in the clear.</p>



<p>Ideally, receiving a notification about breast density would prompt a detailed discussion about breast cancer risk with a doctor. This column can’t replace that. But read on if you’d like to learn more about dense breasts and why the focus on them is a bit of a blunt instrument.</p>



<h4>What are dense breasts?</h4>



<p>Breasts are made up of different kinds of tissue: glandular tissue, which produces milk and directs it to the nipple, plus connective (fibrous) tissue and fatty tissue. Dense breasts have more glandular and connective tissue than fatty tissue.</p>



<p>Having dense breasts “isn’t abnormal,” says internist and epidemiologist Joann Elmore at UCLA. Dense breasts are common too: Around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6579740/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 percent of women ages 40 to 79 in the United States have them</a>, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> in 2019.</p>



<p>A radiologist visually assesses the density of breast tissue from a mammogram. The two non-dense classifications are “almost entirely fatty” and “scattered areas of fibroglandular density,” which means mainly fatty tissue with some areas of dense tissue. Around 8 and 46 percent of U.S. women ages 40 to 79 have those two classifications, respectively.</p>



<p>The two dense categories are “heterogeneously dense” and “extremely dense,” with an estimated 40 percent and 6 percent of U.S. women 40 to 79 in those categories, respectively. The two dense categories are usually lumped together and called “dense breasts.” Under the new FDA rule, that’s how notification letters will be written: that the person’s breast tissue is “dense” or “not dense.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="674" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030923_ac_dense-breasts_inline.jpg" alt="Two x-ray images of breasts.

Dense breast tissue, shown on the right, looks white, which might hide tumors or other areas of concern.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122672">CDC</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>One more thing: Breast density can change. For example, older women tend to have less dense breasts than younger women. And sometimes a person will be switched from “dense” to “not dense” or vice versa, depending on the <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e18772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiologist reading the mammogram</a> and deciding between the “scattered areas of density” and “heterogeneously dense” categories.</p>



<h4>OK, so why do I need to know if I have dense breasts?</h4>





<p>Dense breasts pose two problems. First, on a mammogram, glandular and connective tissue show up as white — which is how tumors or other abnormal breast tissue look too. So dense tissue could hide the very things a radiologist is looking for.</p>



<p>One measure of how well a mammogram works is sensitivity, the proportion of tumors detected by the mammogram out of all the diagnosed tumors (whether found by mammogram or not). An analysis of mammograms from a Dutch screening program found that for those with nearly all fatty tissue, sensitivity was 86 percent, and for scattered areas of density, it was 78 percent. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sensitivity continued to drop</a> with greater density: 70 percent for heterogeneously dense breasts and 61 percent for extremely dense breasts, researchers reported in <em>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</em> in 2017.</p>



<p>Second, dense tissue itself contributes to cancer risk. This may be related to the greater amount of glandular tissue in dense breasts. “Breast cancers almost always develop in the glandular tissue,” says Priscilla Slanetz, a breast radiologist at Boston Medical Center.</p>



<h4>How much do dense breasts increase the risk of a breast cancer diagnosis?</h4>



<p>Modestly. Dense breasts “elevate you above the average person a little bit,” Slanetz says. An average person is someone with no known risk factors for developing breast cancer.</p>



<p>Researchers compared the risk of developing breast cancer in those with dense breasts with the most common non-dense category, scattered areas of density. Premenopausal women with heterogeneously dense breasts are at <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/29/10/2048/124441/Breast-Cancer-Population-Attributable-Risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.5 to 1.8 times greater risk of developing breast cancer</a>, depending on race and ethnicity. Those with extremely dense breasts are at 1.8 to 2.4 times greater risk. For postmenopausal women, the risk was 1.3 to 1.6 times higher for heterogeneously dense breasts and 1.5 to 2 times higher for extremely dense breasts, researchers reported in <em>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s another way to try to explain the risk, from a hypothetical case study of a <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-1822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47-year-old woman who has heterogeneously dense breasts</a> and no family history of breast cancer. Among 1,000 women like the one in the case study with heterogeneously dense breasts, an estimated 20 will develop breast cancer in the following 10 years. That’s compared with 13 of 1,000 like the case study woman but with the most common non-dense category.</p>



<p>It’s also important to know that breast density is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/104/16/1218/910763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not associated with a higher risk of dying</a> from breast cancer, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> in 2012. The analysis of more than 9,000 women with breast cancer suggests that what contributes to developing cancer differs from what affects the risk of dying from breast cancer. A different group of researchers also reported in 2018 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5885304/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no association between breast density and breast cancer death</a>.</p>



<h4>What other factors should I be aware of regarding breast cancer risk?</h4>



<p>Dense breasts are just one part of the risk picture. The two most significant risk factors for developing breast cancer are being female and increasing age, Slanetz says.</p>



<p>About 1 in 8, or 13 percent, of cisgender women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. An estimated <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">297,790 new cases of breast cancer in women</a> are expected in 2023. Males <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/men-with-breast-cancer-have-lower-survival-rates-than-women">account for less than 1 in 100 cases</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/19</em>). And risk goes up as birthdays do: On average, while <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/risk-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 65 women starting at age 40</a> will develop breast cancer in the next 10 years, 1 in 24 women starting at age 70 will, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p>



<p>There are also racial disparities in breast cancer risk. Despite having a slightly lower incidence of breast cancer than white women, Black women have a <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21754" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent higher risk of death</a>: 28 per 100,000 Black women die of breast cancer in the United States compared with 20 per 100,000 white women. Black women are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6941147/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age</a>, have more aggressive disease and are diagnosed at a later stage of cancer, all of which contribute to a poorer prognosis. Inequities in <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/EDBK_319929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access to cancer therapies</a> and surgical treatment contribute to the disparity.</p>



<p>There is less breast cancer data for transgender men and women. Researchers have found that transgender men have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower rates of breast cancer</a> than cisgender women, which appears to be related to the surgical removal of breasts and the use of testosterone. Transgender women have a reduced risk of breast cancer compared with cisgender women due to less exposure to the hormone estrogen over their lives, although estrogen therapy can increase the risk.</p>



<p>Among the factors that greatly increase the risk of developing breast cancer are the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genetic mutations. About 7 in 10 carriers of one of the mutations will have breast cancer by the age of 80. Women who received radiation therapy to the chest as children are also at high risk. These two groups have specific breast cancer screening recommendations.</p>



<p>Online breast cancer risk calculators can help doctors estimate a person’s risk. After adding up their risk factors, people are considered high risk if they have a 20 percent or greater chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. The American College of Radiology recommends that mammograms <a href="https://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440(17)31524-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin at age 30 for those</a> at high risk, supplemented with breast magnetic resonance imaging. The ACR also recommends that Black women be evaluated for breast cancer risk no later than the age of 30.</p>



<p>People with dense breasts — as well as those without, and anyone who is at average risk or a bit above average — should still get screening mammograms, doctors say. Medical organizations have some variation in their <a href="https://jnccn.org/view/journals/jnccn/16/11/article-p1398.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screening recommendations</a> regarding what age to begin and whether to get mammograms annually or every other year.</p>



<h4>What should I do if I have dense breasts?</h4>



<p>There aren’t recommendations specific to dense breasts to guide people or their doctors. People should have information about their breast density, says Ilana Richman, a general internist at the Yale School of Medicine. “But it is an open question what to do with that information,” she says, because of the lack of guidelines.</p>



<p>Some states’ notifications have suggested people with dense breasts might benefit from supplemental screening with a different imaging technology, such as MRI or ultrasound. With the new FDA rule, notifications will say that in some people with dense tissue, adding other imaging tests may help find cancer. However, density alone isn’t enough to bump someone up to the high risk category and a need for supplemental screening, says Karla Kerlikowske, a primary care physician and clinical epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “There’s a lot of people that have dense breasts who are actually at low risk of breast cancer,” she says.</p>



<p>Ideally, a dense breast notification would lead to a discussion with a doctor about different breast cancer risks, to understand a person&#8217;s overall risk. But the limited time allotted to primary care visits in the United States is an obstacle. “We don’t have a system that allows enough time for that nuanced discussion,” says Christina Chapman, a radiation oncologist and health equity researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p>



<p>Plus, that conversation should happen with people who have nondense breasts too, who could still be at high risk. “The focus on breast density in some ways just distracts from the idea that risk is multidimensional,” Richman says.</p>



<p>Many women who develop breast cancer don’t have any apparent risk factors, Planetz says, which is why screening mammograms are important. “We screen [everyone] because we have to.”</p>

<h4>For good measure</h4>



<p><em>Cutting carbon dioxide emissions to curb climate change and reach net-zero is possible but not easy, <strong>Alexandra Witze</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/net-zero-carbon-emissions-climate">The road to net-zero</a>” (</em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 22<em>).</em></p>



<p>A report by Princeton U­niversity’s Net-Zero America project, released in 2021, estimates that wind and solar power production needs to roughly quadruple by 2030 to achieve the United States’ goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, <strong>Witze</strong> reported. In the most ambitious scenario, “wind turbines would cover an area the size of Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and O­klahoma combined,” she wrote.</p>





<p>Reader <strong>Mary Sweeney </strong>noted that, while technically correct, the statement quoted above could be misleading. “What the Princeton report actually states is that the visual footprint of the turbines would be equivalent to the combined areas of the states listed above. In other words, that figure for land use was reached by considering the very large area from which the very tall turbines would be visible,” <strong>Sweeney</strong> wrote. The actual land use would be only a tiny fraction of the visual footprint.</p>



<h4>Disappearing act</h4>



<p><em>A glass frog hides nearly all of its red blood cells in the liver while it sleeps, upping the animal’s transparency,<strong> Susan Milius</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleeping-glass-frogs-blood-liver">Glass frogs make their blood vanish</a>” (</em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 6<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Len Yaeger</strong> wondered what criteria the researchers used to determine transparency in the frogs.</p>



<p>Biologists think about transparency a bit differently from physicists, says <strong>Jesse Delia</strong> of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “If the individual tissues are transmitting over 90 percent of light, they’re — as far as biology goes — relatively perfectly transparent,” he says. Glass frogs’ green dorsal skin “gives them sort of a diffuse transmittance, like the filtered light if you were to look up at the tree canopy on a sunny day.”</p>





<p>What’s more, the translucence of glass frog skin appears across a continuum. The clearest see-through skin is on the belly, which helps explain why it took <strong>Delia</strong> some years to notice the cell-hiding phenomenon in sleeping frogs. <strong>Delia</strong> had often seen the frogs sleep in the wild, their less-translucent backs facing outward as the frogs clung to leaves. “It wasn’t until I saw them sleeping in captivity on glass that I could actually see their bellies,” he says. From there, “you can see straight in to their organs.”</p>



<p>Since the frogs can pack their red blood cells together without forming clots, reader <strong>Mara Chen-Goldberg</strong> wondered, could the discovery aid research into blood clot treatments for humans?</p>



<p>Many people are asking the same question, <strong>Delia</strong> says. The frogs seem to somehow inhibit the typical vertebrate blood-clotting process. “But at this point, we don’t know whether that mechanism would be directly translatable to human medicine,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-with-tools-you-may-be-a-cockatoo">Good with tools? You may be a cockatoo</a></h4>

              
                <p>We humans pride ourselves on our superior smarts, given our ability to make fire, use tools and subscribe to Netflix. But if other animals could counter that presumption, they might say they’re doing just fine, thank you.</p>



<p>The latest entrant in the animal smarts sweepstakes is the Goffin’s cockatoo. Birds in a laboratory in Vienna deployed both a pointy stick and a straw <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoos-tool-kit-national-park">to extract a cashew from a clear box</a>. They used the stick to poke a hole in a paper barrier erected by the scientists, then the straw to knock the cashew free. When scientists removed the paper barrier, some birds left the pointy stick home, staff writer Erin Garcia de Jesús reports. Why tote around more tools than you need?</p>





<p>Wild cockatoos in Indonesia wield three different sticks to break open fruit pits. Other animals, including crows, also use tools but don’t use multiple objects as a toolkit. That puts these cockatoos in the rarefied realm along with chimpanzees as the only non­human animals known to use tool sets.</p>



<p>Last year, Garcia de Jesús reported on another epic cockatoo skill — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoo-open-trash-cans">outwitting humans trying to keep the birds from raiding trash cans</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 10</em>). Many people, myself included, have resorted to using a brick or a bungee to prevent nocturnal snacking by raccoons and opossums. The cockatoos of Sydney would scoff at such a paltry effort. They quickly figured out they could push off a brick. But they were thwarted, at least for now, when humans wedged water bottles or sticks into the bins’ back handles. The birds appear to be learning as the humans invent new defenses.</p>



<p>And lest you think bird brains have a lock on animal smarts,<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-recognize-photo-self-aware"> fish may be able to recognize themselves in photos or a mirror</a>. Researchers in Japan found that when looking in a mirror, bluestreak cleaner wrasses would try to scrape off marks that researchers had put on their bodies. The fish could also distinguish their faces in photos from those of other cleaner fish. Not all scientists are convinced that the fish are self-aware, but piscine partisans say it’s time to give aquatic vertebrates their due, freelance contributor Betsy Mason reports.</p>



<p>That makes sense, given that goldfish can drive. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/goldfish-car-drive-navigation-biology">Researchers in Israel taught six goldfish how to drive a water-filled tank</a> to destinations around a room, we reported last year (<em>SN: 2/12/22, p. 4</em>). The fish were trained to steer toward a pink board on one side of the room and could find it even when researchers moved the board to another wall.</p>



<p>We loved the driving goldfish story so much that we turned it into a comic for <em>Science News Explores</em>, our magazine and website for younger readers. Evidently we weren’t the only people who were charmed. The <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/goldfish-driving-cars-navigation-comic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">navigating fish comic</a>, along with another on the <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/cockatoos-social-learning-culture-garbage-australia-comic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garbage bin–raiding cockatoos</a> and a third about <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/panda-bear-zoo-wild-camouflage-predators-comic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pandas’ camouflage skills</a>, won the top award for science journalism for children in the 2022 AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Awards.</p>



<p>Thank you, animals, for continuing to amaze us, even as you chip away at our smug sense of superiority. Some animals even use computers, including non­human primates who have been trained to use touch screens. It’s only a matter of time before they’re writing editor’s notes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/runaway-black-hole-galaxy-hubble">A runaway black hole has been spotted fleeing a distant galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p>A streak of light stretching away from a remote galaxy might be the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04888v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first sure sign of a gargantuan black hole on the run</a>, a new study reports. The putative black hole, fleeing its host galaxy, appears to be leaving a trail of newborn stars and shocked gas in its wake. If confirmed, the intergalactic escape could help astronomers learn more about what happens to black holes when galaxies collide.</p>



<p>“It’s a very cool, serendipitous discovery,” says astronomer Charlotte Angus of the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved in the new work. “The possibility that this might be due to a supermassive black hole that’s been ejected from its galaxy is very exciting. These events have been predicted by theory, but up until now, there’s been little evidence for them.”</p>





<p>While looking for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-dark-matter-dwarf-galaxies-physics-space">colliding dwarf galaxies</a> with the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomer Pieter van Dokkum and colleagues spotted something peculiar: a long, straight line that seemed to extend away from a distant galaxy, growing narrower and brighter as it went (<em>SN: 5/18/22</em>).</p>



<p>“Whatever it is, we haven’t seen it before,” says van Dokkum, of Yale University. “Most astronomical objects are shaped like a spiral or a blob. There are not many objects that are just a line in the sky.” When astronomers do see lines, they’re usually from something moving, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-spacex-problem-space-pollution">a satellite crossing the telescope’s field of view</a> (<em>SN: 3/3/23</em>).</p>



<p>To figure out what it was, van Dokkum and colleagues took follow-up observations with the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Those observations showed that the streak was associated with a galaxy whose light took about 8 billion years — more than half the age of the universe — to get to Earth, the team reports in a paper submitted February 9 to arXiv.org. The distance measurement let the team calculate the length of the line: roughly 200,000 light-years.</p>



<p>That certainly ruled out a satellite. </p>



<p>“We considered a lot of explanations, and the one that fit the best is what we’re witnessing is a massive object, like a black hole, moving very rapidly away from the galaxy,” van Dokkum says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="466" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030723_lg_blackhole_inline1.jpg" alt="An image from the Hubble Space Telescope that shows a runaway black hole as a straight white line." class="wp-image-3122520" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030723_lg_blackhole_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030723_lg_blackhole_inline1-559x383.jpg 559w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030723_lg_blackhole_inline1-657x450.jpg 657w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030723_lg_blackhole_inline1-271x186.jpg 271w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122520">The runaway black hole showed up as a straight line in a Hubble image (shown).

<p>Black holes on their own are invisible. But “if a black hole leaves a galaxy, it doesn’t leave by itself,” van Dokkum says. Some of the stars and gas that were gravitationally bound to the black hole leave with it. That gas will emit strong radiation that telescopes can detect. The black hole’s path through the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cloak-controls-galaxy-future-coming-focus">gas and dust in the galaxy’s outer regions</a> can compress some of that gas into new stars, too, which would also be visible (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>Another possibility is that the line is a jet of radiation launched by the galaxy’s central supermassive black hole. But that scenario would probably lead to a beam that is narrow when it is close to the galaxy and broadens as it gets farther away. This streak does the opposite.</p>





<p>If it’s a black hole, it could have been ejected from the galaxy’s center by interacting with one or two other black holes nearby. Almost every galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. When galaxies merge, their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/andromeda-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole-collision-simulation">central black holes also eventually merge</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/21</em>). If the conditions are right, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-gravitational-waves-kick-ligo-merger-spacetime">merger can give the resulting black hole a “kick,”</a> sending it flying away at high speed (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>Alternatively, the black hole could have been spat out of a smashup among three galaxies. When a third galaxy joins an ongoing merger, three supermassive black holes jockey for position. One black hole can be tossed out of the galactic smashup, while the other two take off more slowly in the other direction.</p>



<p>That’s what van Dokkum thinks happened in this case. There are signs of a shorter, dimmer streak heading in the opposite direction from the bright, straight line.</p>



<p>More observations of this system, perhaps with the James Webb Space Telescope, are needed to confirm that it really is an ejected supermassive black hole, Angus says. More theoretical calculations of what a runaway supermassive black hole should look like would help too.</p>



<p>The finding motivates Angus to search through archived data for more potential black hole streaks. “I wonder if there are more of these features out there, sitting in someone’s data that might have just been missed,” she says.</p>



<p>Van Dokkum does too. “Now that we know what to look for, these very thin streaks, it makes sense to go back to Hubble data. We have 25 years of Hubble images that have not been searched with this purpose,” he says. “If there are more to be found, I think we can do it.”</p>

Conscious sensations are essential to our idea of ourselves but is it only humans who feel this way? Do animals?

Nicholas Humphrey has been researching these issues for fifty years. In this extraordinary book, weaving together intellectual adventure, cutting-edge science, and his own breakthrough experiences, he tells the story of his quest to uncover the evolutionary history of consciousness: from his discovery of blindsight after brain damage in monkeys, to hanging out with mountain gorillas in Rwanda, to becoming a leading philosopher of mind. Out of this, he has come up with an explanation of conscious feeling—&#8221;phenomenal consciousness&#8221;—that he presents here in full for the first time. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Buy&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sentience-9780198858539?utm_campaign=1602649552859254537&amp;utm_source=oupblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=button&amp;utm_term=button+link"><strong><em>Sentience, The Invention of Consciousness</em></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;(UK Only)</strong></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/01/do-look-up-could-a-comet-really-kill-us-all/"></a></p><p>As an added bonus, you can also read more on the topics of evolutionary biology, the magic of mathematics, and artificial intelligence&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-landmark-science-ols/?utm_campaign=1602649552859254537&amp;utm_source=oupblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=button&amp;utm_term=button+link">Oxford Landmark Science</a>&nbsp;series.

<p>Hindawi, the open access publisher that Wiley acquired in 2021, temporarily suspended publishing special issues because of “compromised articles,” according to a <a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Wiley-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2023-Results/default.aspx">press release</a> announcing the company’s third quarter financial results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brian Napack, Wiley’s president and CEO, specifically noted the “unplanned publishing pause at Hindawi” as a factor that “challenged” the company this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pause began in mid-October and ended in mid-January, a Wiley spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Wiley’s third quarter that ended Jan. 31, 2023, the suspension cost Hindawi – whose business model is based on charging authors to publish – $9 million in lost revenue compared to the third quarter of 2022. The company cited the pause as the primary reason its revenue from its research segment “was down 4% as reported, or down 2% at constant currency and excluding acquisitions,” the press release stated.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126674"></span>



<p>At the time of this writing, Wiley’s stock was trading 16% lower than it opened in the morning, and reached a new low for the past year.</p>



<p>The announcement follows <a href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2022/10/what-is-going-on-in-hindawi-special.html">scrutiny from sleuths</a>, and the publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">retracting hundreds of papers</a> for manipulated peer review last September, after Hindawi’s research integrity team began investigating a single special issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/05/a-paper-used-capital-ts-instead-of-error-bars-but-wait-theres-more/">notorious paper</a> with capital Ts as error bars was also published in a special issue of a Hindawi journal before it was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">retracted in December</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">another episode</a> we reported on last month, a professor used the email account of a former student to conduct all the correspondence needed to edit special issues of two Hindawi journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nearly 300 articles in the two special issues were “mostly meaningless gobbledegook” that suggested they came from a paper mill, according to sleuth Dorothy Bishop, who recently published a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv">preprint</a> identifying signs of paper mill activity in Hindawi special issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our query about the timing of the pause, a Wiley spokesperson told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley has taken significant measures to address research integrity challenges after identifying misconduct in the external peer review process in Hindawi’s special issues, which are topic-specific issues of our journals. We moved to pause publication of special issues, increase controls and specialist staffing on all articles in progress in special issues, and introduce AI-based screening tools into the process … To counteract integrity issues in the future, we have added additional checks on guest editors and special issues.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-insect-fruit-fly-detail-nerve-cell">Scientists have mapped an insect brain in greater detail than ever before</a></h4>

              
                <p>The wiring of one insect’s brain no longer contains much uncharted territory.</p>



<p>All of the nerve cells — and virtually every connection between them — in a larval fruit fly brain have now been mapped, researchers report in the March 10 <em>Science</em>. It’s the <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add9330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most complex whole brain wiring diagram</a> yet created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, just three organisms — a sea squirt and two types of worm — had their brain circuitry fully diagrammed to this resolution. But the brains of those creatures have only a few hundred neurons. The scientists who conducted the new study wanted to understand much more complicated brains.</p>





<p>Fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) share a wide range of behaviors with humans, including integrating sensory information and learning. Larvae perform nearly all the same actions as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-complete-look-yet-fruit-fly-brain-cells">adult flies</a> — except for some, like flying and mating — but have smaller brains, making data collection much faster (<em>SN: 7/19/18</em>).</p>



<p>The idea for this project came 12 years ago, says neuroscientist Marta Zlatic of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. At that time, she and her colleagues captured electron microscope images of the entire larval fruit fly brain. They then stitched those images together in a computer and manually traced each neuron to create a 3-D rendering of the cells. Finally, the team found the connections where information gets passed between the cells, and even determined the sending and receiving ends.</p>



<p>The researchers identified more than 3,000 neurons and about 550,000 connections, known as synapses.</p>

<p>Neurons transmit information to one another in circuits. Exploring the neurons’ connectivity patterns — not just directly linked partners, but also the links of linked cells and so on — revealed 93 different types of neurons. The classes were consistent with preexisting groupings characterized by shape and function. And nearly 75 percent of the most well-connected neurons were tied to the brain’s learning center, indicating the importance of learning in animals.</p>



<p>The researchers hope that this work serves as a blueprint for fellow scientists studying brain circuitry. “Now we have a reference map,” Zlatic says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dry-farming-agriculture-climate-change">Dry farming could help agriculture in the western U.S. amid climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the parking lot behind a grocery store in Portland, Ore., last September, several hundred tomato aficionados gathered on a sunny, breezy day for Tomato Fest. While many attendees devoured slices of tomato quiche and admired garlands of tomatoes with curiously pointed ends, I beelined to a yellow-tented booth hosted by Oregon State University. Agricultural researcher Matt Davis was handing out samples of experimental tomatoes.</p>



<p>I took four small plastic bags, each labeled with a cryptic set of letters and numbers and containing a thick slice of a yellow tomato. Scanning a QR code with my phone led me to an online survey with questions about each tomato’s balance of acidity and sweetness, texture and overall flavor. As I chewed on the slice from the bag marked “d86,” I noted the firm, almost meaty texture. Lacking the wateriness of a typical supermarket tomato, it would hold up beautifully in a salad or on a burger, I thought. And most importantly, it was tasty.</p>

The practice saves on water and produces more flavorful fruits and vegetables, advocates say.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122493">K. Kornei</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I learned later that this tomato had been dry-farmed, a form of agriculture that doesn’t require irrigation. Dry farming has roots stretching back millennia. But in the western United States, the practice largely fell out of widespread use in the 20th century.</p>



<p>Today, however, farmers in the West are once again experimenting with dry farming as they grapple with water shortages, which are being exacerbated by rising temperatures and more frequent and intense droughts linked to climate change.</p>





<p>Finding a more sustainable way to grow food in a thirsty state like California, for example, <a href="https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Water-Use-And-Efficiency/Agricultural-Water-Use-Efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where agriculture accounts for roughly 80 percent of water usage</a> and where a third of U.S. vegetables are grown, is a top priority. Dry farming won’t solve all of agriculture’s woes, but it offers a way forward, particularly for smaller-scale producers, while drawing less on a scarce natural resource. And even though the practice isn’t without limitations — dry-farmed produce tends to be physically smaller, and harvests are less bountiful overall — its benefits extend beyond water savings: Dry farming can also yield longer-lasting and better-tasting produce.</p>



<h4>How does dry farming work?</h4>



<p>It’s a common misconception that dry farming means growing plants without water. “Nothing grows without water,” says Amy Garrett, president of the nonprofit <a href="https://dryfarming.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dry Farming Institute</a> in Corvallis, Ore. Instead, dry-farmed plants take up moisture stored in the ground rather than sprinkled from above.</p>



<p>Dry farming is possible in states throughout the West. What’s needed is a wet rainy season, when rainwater infiltrates the soil, followed by a dry growing season, when plant roots pull in that moisture as needed. A wide variety of fruits and vegetables — including tomatoes, potatoes, squash, corn and even watermelons — can be dry-farmed. Dry farming is distinct from rain-fed agriculture, when crops grow during a wet season without the aid of irrigation.</p>





<p>For dry farming to work, a couple elements are essential. “You need to be in a place where there’s sufficient rainfall to create moisture in the soil,” says David Runsten, water policy director at the Community Alliance with Family Farmers in Davis, Calif. Sites must generally receive more than 50 centimeters of annual precipitation — in 2022, that was true in 26 of California’s 58 counties, for example — and the soil must be composed of fine grains that help retain that water over time.</p>



<p>Beyond that, farmers employ a range of techniques to help crops get all the moisture they need. Those methods include planting earlier in the season than usual to take advantage of soil moisture stored up from winter rains and spacing plants more widely to give roots more room to search for water. Farmers can also plant young seedlings in furrows to minimize the drying effects of the wind and lay down an insulating layer of mulch — often leaves, wood chips or straw — on top of the soil.</p>



<p>Dry farming is standard practice in many places around the world, from olive groves in the Mediterranean to melon fields in Botswana to vineyards in Chile. In the American West, dry farming has a long history stretching back thousands of years among Indigenous peoples.</p>



<p>“Dry farming is just farming — it’s our way of life,” says Michael Kotutwa Johnson, an Indigenous resiliency specialist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He’s also a member of the Hopi Tribe and dry-farms corn, lima beans and other crops. He learned the practice from his grandfather.</p>



<p>The intimate knowledge of the natural world that dry farming requires aligns with the Hopi community’s values and spiritual beliefs, he says. “You get to really learn what the environment gives you, and you learn to reciprocate.” A relationship develops between the cropping system and the farmer, he says. “It’s a beautiful thing, and it’s something that needs to be cherished.”</p>

Johnson</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As non-Indigenous people started arriving in the West, they too began to dry-farm. But by the 20th century, many commercial farmers started relying on irrigation to capture growing markets. Having water on demand gave farmers more control and allowed them to boost production, says Jay Lund, vice director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis. “They could have a lot more reliable crop yields, and much higher crop yields.”</p>



<p>But today, irrigation water in many parts of the West is in short supply. In places like California’s San Joaquin Valley — the state’s largest agricultural region — water is pumped up from deep aquifers and often transported through canals and pipes before being deposited on crops. Researchers estimate that more than a quarter of irrigation water can be lost during transport due to evaporation and leaks. An even bigger problem in this region is that water is being <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/exploring-the-potential-for-water-limited-agriculture-in-the-san-joaquin-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extracted from the ground at a faster rate than it’s being replenished</a>. “There just isn’t sufficient water for the amount of farmland that’s been planted,” Runsten says.</p>



<p>And access to irrigation is already being curtailed. Farmers in California and other states in the West are experiencing water shortages and have at times been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">entirely cut off from irrigation</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<p>That’s not likely to change in the future, Runsten says. To meet the goals of California’s 2014 <a href="https://water.ca.gov/programs/groundwater-management/sgma-groundwater-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Groundwater Management Act</a>, for instance, more than 200,000 hectares of irrigated farmland in the San Joaquin Valley — roughly 10 percent — will need to be taken out of irrigated production by 2040. Dry-farming speciality crops like agave or jujube, an Asian fruit similar to a date, could be an economically attractive alternative for the land, according to a 2022 report by the nonprofit Public Policy Institute of California.</p>



<h4>Dry farming has pros and cons</h4>



<p>Catherine Nguyen, who farms on a little less than half a hectare of leased land outside of Portland, Ore., in the Willamette Valley, has been dry-farming for two years. Nguyen — whose customers include farmers market shoppers, members of her community supported agriculture, or CSA, program and small restaurants — was drawn to the practice in part out of curiosity. “I love experimentation and with the changing climate and cost of water, it seemed like something to learn more about,” she says. A portion of her property also lacks access to irrigation, so dry farming made it possible to use land that would otherwise remain fallow.</p>



<p>Potatoes were the first crop Nguyen dry-farmed. Beyond saving roughly 7,500 liters of water, Nguyen and her small crew discovered other benefits. There was no need for sprinklers, drip tape, hosing or any other irrigation equipment. That meant Nguyen’s farm could cut down on a lot of plastic equipment intended to last for just one or two growing seasons. “Not only is our water usage down, but so is our plastic usage,” Nguyen says. That lighter environmental touch is important to Nguyen, who uses farming methods that promote healthy soil ecosystems, including minimal tillage and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-erosion-rate-us-midwest-unsustainable-usda">cover cropping</a>, which involves growing plants specifically to improve the soil rather than for a harvest (<em>SN Online: 4/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>Last year, Nguyen dry-farmed delicata squash, corn, tomatoes, potatoes and beans. Nguyen noticed that her dry-farmed plots contained only about a fifth of the weeds that grow in her irrigated plots. That’s another known advantage of dry farming, Garrett says. Irrigation creates conditions for weed growth: Dispensing water through above­ground sprinklers causes moisture to pool near the surface, precisely where weeds wait for water, she says. “There is a weed seed bank in the top few inches of soil.”</p>



<p>Not having to pull up as many weeds or apply herbicides can translate into labor savings. Coupled with not having to manage irrigation infrastructure, dry farming can streamline a growing operation, Garrett says. “There’s a lot less to do.” <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/december/u-s-fruit-and-vegetable-industries-try-to-cope-with-rising-labor-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labor accounts for more than a quarter of total production costs</a> for U.S. fruit and vegetable farmers.</p>



<p>Another benefit is that the produce contains less water and therefore tends to store better. In 2016 and 2017, Alex Stone, a horticulturist at Oregon State University, and her student Jennifer Wetzel grew different varieties of winter squash at the university’s research farm in Corvallis. The pair irrigated some vegetable plots and dry-farmed others. After harvesting the squash and leaving them in storage for four months, Stone and Wetzel found that about 1,000 of the roughly 1,250 dry-farmed winter squash, or <a href="https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/1j92gd35b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 80 percent, were still marketable</a>. But only about 600 of the roughly 1,150 irrigated winter squash, or about 50 percent, were marketable.</p>

<h4>In search of water</h4>



<p>Dry-farmed tomatoes grow longer roots (plant on the left in the photograph) than irrigated tomatoes (plant on the right). Dry-farmed tomatoes are planted early in spring so they can access water in the topsoil (darker brown in the diagram). A lack of irrigation in summer encourages the roots to go searching for water as the soil dries out. By fall, the roots can be more than a meter deep.</p>

<p>Longer-lasting produce is a boon for small-scale fruit and vegetable growers, Garrett says. Winter is often a slow time sales-wise because there’s not much ripening. Selling stored crops in winter is one way that these farmers can earn an income during that lull. “If winter squash is storing months longer, that makes a huge impact for our local growers,” she says. Produce that lasts longer also means less food waste, both in farmers’ storage bins and in shoppers’ refrigerators and pantries.</p>



<p>Dry farming does have its downsides, however. The practice tends to produce smaller fruits and vegetables. That’s a natural outcome of withholding irrigation, Lund says. “The plant has less water to feed the growth of the fruit.” And growers, to say nothing of shoppers, can be wary of diminutively sized produce. That’s true among farmers in Oregon, Stone says. “They want a big, red tomato.”</p>



<p>Overall yields also tend to be lower. Not only does a dry-farmed plant produce fewer fruits or vegetables, but it also needs more space than its irrigated brethren so that its root system can spread out in search of water. Dry-farmed tomatoes, for instance, are typically planted almost two meters apart in rows separated by about two meters. Irrigated tomatoes can grow much closer together, about 60 centimeters apart, with rows separated by a meter or so.</p>



<p>Stone and Wetzel found that yields of irrigated winter squash at Oregon State’s research farm averaged 35.7 metric tons per hectare in 2016 and 32.2 metric tons in 2017. Dry-farmed squash yields were only 37 to 76 percent as much.</p>



<p>Diminished harvests can be a challenge. “With land access already being one of the biggest obstacles to farming, sometimes it’s hard for me to justify dry farming,” Nguyen says. Last year, she dry-farmed on only about a tenth of her property. “I do have to consider yield per square foot when deciding how much land to dry-farm,” she says.</p>



<p>Smaller harvests can translate to more expensive produce. “You don’t have the economies of scale,” Lund says. “Your costs are much higher per unit of production.” Dry-farmed tomatoes, for instance, typically sell for $4–$6 per pound and are primarily found at farmers markets and specialty grocery stores. That’s compared with $2–$3 per pound for traditional supermarket tomatoes grown with irrigation.</p>



<p>Dry-farmed produce may never become truly mainstream, Johnson says. “I don’t see us moving in that direction as long as we still have a market system that’s based on efficiency and quantity.” But many dry farming experts argue that paying more for dry-farmed produce is an investment in the future. And, they point out, dry-farmed produce tastes better.</p>

<h4>How does dry farming affect flavor?</h4>



<p>In California’s Napa Valley, there’s nary an irrigation hose snaking through Dominus Estate’s roughly 55-hectare Napanook Vineyard. Every last one of the more than 100,000 cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and petit verdot grapevines planted there is dry-farmed.</p>



<p>The water savings are tremendous, says Tod Mostero, Dominus Estate’s director of viticulture and winemaking. A single irrigated grapevine is typically irrigated with nearly 40 liters of water several times or more over the growing season, he says. For a vineyard the size of Napanook, that translates to nearly 4 million liters, or about a million gallons, for just one watering, Mostero says. In drought-prone California, that’s not sustainable, he says. “Pumping millions of gallons of water out of the soil is not something that we can continue to do.”</p>



<p>Beyond the water savings, there’s another reason Napanook Vineyard is dry-farmed, Mostero says. The practice produces the best wines, he contends. When grapevines are dry-farmed, the unique flavors of a wine associated with a place, and even a vintage, often shine through. Grapevines can send roots up to six meters deep in search of moisture. As those roots pass through layers of soil and rock, they absorb a complex set of minerals unique to that location, Mostero says. “You really find the terroir, the subtle differences between different areas.” For that very reason, some wine-growing regions, in parts of Europe for example, forbid vineyards from irrigating wine grapes.</p>



<p>Oenophiles aren’t the only ones swearing by the superior flavors of dry-farmed fruits and vegetables. Laurence Jossel, the chef-owner of Nopa, a restaurant in San Francisco that specializes in wood-fired cuisine, sources dry-farmed tomatoes from local farms. Tomatoes that are bloated with water taste “boring,” Jossel maintains. “The acid is gone, and the sweetness is gone.” He uses dry-farmed tomatoes in everything from soups to flatbreads. Sometimes they’re the star ingredient: A salad of chopped tomatoes topped with a bit of feta or mozzarella is one of Nopa’s summer offerings. “The tomato itself is just amazing,” he says.</p>



<h4>What’s the future of dry farming?</h4>



<p>Despite the environmental benefits of dry farming, some farmers remain wary. Stone has found that growers in Oregon are often cautious about the practice, even when it comes to cultivating varieties that sell well elsewhere. A case in point is Early Girl tomatoes, which are extensively dry-farmed in California and available at both California supermarkets and farmers markets.</p>



<p>“They just see them as elite, expensive, small tomatoes,” Stone says.</p>



<p>To explore the economic viability of dry farming, Stone is leading farming trials of dry-farmed crops to determine which varieties are most suited to commercial production. In recent years, she and colleagues have focused on tomatoes, which, after potatoes, are the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most commonly consumed vegetable in the United States</a>. (Technically a fruit, tomatoes are considered a vegetable for nutritional and culinary purposes by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.)</p>



<p>Stone’s team at Oregon State has grown hundreds of types of tomatoes. By recording yields, susceptibility to <a href="https://www.almanac.com/pest/blossom-end-rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common diseases like blossom-end rot</a>, and the size, firmness and flavor of the tomatoes, the researchers have started to home in on varieties that thrive — and taste good — when the irrigation is turned off. The first yellow tomato I sampled at Tomato Fest is one of the researchers’ leading contenders.</p>

<p>Dry farming offers one way forward as water resources become more unpredictable in the future. But it’s not a one-size-fits-all panacea for climate change, researchers admit. In some cases, crops that once thrived without irrigation may no longer do well at some point in the future.</p>



<p>“As summers become hotter and drier, crops will require even more water as they will lose more water [through evapotranspiration], making dry farming riskier,” Stone says.</p>



<p>Some farmers may have to swap one type of crop for another that’s more suited to even drier conditions. Fruit trees with particularly long, deep roots are good bets, Garrett says, as are species like melons that originally evolved in arid locales.</p>



<p>Whatever the future holds, being adaptable will be key. Farmers must be prepared to respond to changing conditions, Johnson says, but must also allow nature to lead. After all, that’s worked for his community for thousands of years.</p>



<p>“We raise corn to fit the environment,” he says. “We do not manipulate the environment to fit the corn.”</p>

<p>In March 2020, a group of biologists published a paper on the website of an open access journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly three years later, the publisher, Wiley, withdrew the article because, according to the withdrawal notice, the authors were “unable to finalize” payment of the fee to publish the version of record, known as the Article Publication Charge or APC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The manuscript, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12950">Eco-evolutionary factors that influence its demographic oscillations in <em>Prochilodus costatus</em> (Actinopterygii: Characiformes) populations evidenced through a genetic spatial–temporal evaluation</a>,” had appeared on the site of the journal <em>Evolutionary Applications </em>“as an Accepted Article,” according to the notice, but the full text is no longer available online. It had not been indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science before being withdrawn on February 27.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice stated that the article&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126667"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>has been withdrawn by agreement between the authors, journal Editor-in-Chief Louis Bernatchez and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. The withdrawal has been agreed because the authors are unable to finalize the APC payment for their article for publication in the journal as the Version of Record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we wrote to Bernatchez with questions about the notice, he referred us to a Wiley staffer. A spokesperson for the publisher told us that the statement was “incorrect,” and “we will be working with the author to resolve and potentially republish the article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked what exactly was wrong with the withdrawal note, and a spokesperson replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The withdrawal statement incorrectly lists the authors as agreeing to the withdrawal, when in fact they were only informed of this action. We are now working with the authors to resubmit the article to the journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The spokesperson also said that the final version of the article “was not published in alignment with our <a href="https://authorservices.wiley.com/open-research/open-access/for-authors/publication-charges.html">Open Access Publication Charges</a> policy.”</p>



<p>Previously, a Wiley account had tweeted:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi there, thanks for reaching out.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-ozone-layer-chemical-reaction-smoke">How wildfires deplete the Earth’s ozone layer</a></h4>

              
                <p>Towering clouds of smoke sent into the stratosphere by ferocious wildfires can eat away at Earth’s ozone layer thanks to a potent mix of smoke, atmospheric chemistry and ultraviolet light, a new study finds.</p>



<p>During late 2019 and early 2020, Australia’s skies turned black, darkened by thick columns of wildfire smoke that reached into the stratosphere. In the aftermath, satellite data revealed that the smoke was somehow reacting with atmospheric molecules <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smoke-australia-fires-ozone-layer-damage-chemistry-climate">to eat away at Earth’s ozone layer</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/22</em>). But how exactly that was happening wasn’t clear.</p>





<p>Now, scientists have put together <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05683-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pieces of that chemical puzzle</a>. Once in the stratosphere, the team says, the smoke particles were able to interact with stratospheric gases as well as lingering emissions of ozone-destroying chemicals. Add in solar radiation, and that smoky brew churned out chlorine radicals, a type of chemical with an affinity for attacking ozone, researchers report in the March 9 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>This series of events was responsible for depleting about 3 to 5 percent of the ozone layer in parts of the Southern Hemisphere during 2020, the researchers estimate. That’s a small fraction of the whole — but it rivals the scale of the impact of human emissions of ozone-eating chlorofluorocarbons in their heyday, says MIT atmospheric chemist Susan Solomon.</p>



<p>Chlorofluorocarbons were once used in air conditioners and refrigerators, but their emission to the atmosphere led to a large hole over Antarctica in Earth’s protective ozone layer, which limits how much of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation reaches the planet’s surface.</p>



<p>In the new study, Solomon and her colleagues compared atmospheric observations of chlorine, ozone and other molecules following the Australian wildfires with simulations of atmospheric chemistry. Satellites had measured the abundance of certain chemicals in the stratosphere in 2020 — not just ozone, but also hydrogen chloride gas and chlorine nitrate, among others. Those levels caught Solomon’s attention.</p>



<p>“What we saw over Australia was a tremendous drop in hydrogen chloride” in the satellite data, Solomon says. “I thought, gosh, this looks just like Antarctica. How can this be happening over Australia?”</p>



<p>Hydrogen chloride gas is a product of the breakdown of chlorofluorocarbons, which can linger for decades in the stratosphere. The frigid environment over Antarctica was a key part of the ozone hole’s formation, because at those temperatures hydrogen chloride gas can dissolve into the icy clouds traveling through the stratosphere. The absorption of that gas is essential to starting the chain of reactions that form ozone-depleting chemicals.</p>



<p>The atmosphere over Australia is too warm for this process — but the satellite data indicated that something was still removing hydrogen chloride gas from the atmosphere. Solomon and her team realized that the culprit was the organic particles in the smoke. Those particles can absorb hydrogen chloride gas even at warmer temperatures, kicking off that essential first step.</p>





<p>With the absorbed hydrogen chloride, the smoke particles can act as catalysts, helping to speed along other reactions in the atmosphere. In particular, the particles amp up the transformation of other chlorine-containing gases floating in the stratosphere, such as chlorine nitrate and hypochlorous acid, into chlorine compounds that are highly reactive to sunlight.</p>



<p>Mixing the sun’s ultraviolet radiation with those new chlorine compounds produces chlorine radicals, freewheeling molecules that are extremely chemically reactive — and especially enjoy attacking ozone molecules.</p>



<p>The discovery of this wildfire-related process for destroying ozone is a worrisome potential setback to the recovery of the ozone layer, Solomon says. The 1987 Montreal Protocol targeted the use of chlorofluorocarbons, which were phased out by 2010, an act that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drop-cfc-emissions-hole-ozone-layer-back-on-track-closing">has been encouragingly successful</a> at shrinking the hole in the ozone over Antarctica (<em>SN: 2/10/21</em>). The ozone layer has shown signs of recovery ever since, growing back on the order of 1 percent per decade, she says.</p>



<p>However, the smoke from the Australian wildfires more or less “wiped out all that hard work” for the year, Solomon adds. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of wildfires around the globe, sending <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/willdfire-thunder-pyro-clouds-aerosols-volcanic-eruptions">more towering fire clouds</a> high into the sky (<em>SN: 12/15/20</em>). If these fires “are a one-time deal, it’s maybe not so bad” for ozone recovery, Solomon says. “But if it happens every five years, that’s a different kettle of fish.”</p>



<p>The study elegantly explains several puzzling satellite observations made in the wake of the Australian fires, says Ross Salawitch, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the work. It elucidates the drop in hydrogen chloride, he says, as well as strange increases in other chlorine compounds like chlorine nitrate and chlorine oxide. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the “icing on the cake,” Salawitch says, is how the discovery of the role of organic particles can improve our understanding of what controls the size of the ozone hole. This is important, not just because we want to get the details right, he says, but because “one of the unfortunate consequences of global warming is likely an increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/520-million-year-old-animal-fossils">520-million-year-old animal fossils might not be animals after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>A species that lived about 520 million years ago and was thought to be the oldest known bryozoan is instead a type of colony-forming algae, a new study proposes.</p>



<p>Bryozoans are filter-feeding, tentacle-bearing animals that live in apartment complex–like colonies attached to rocks, shells or other surfaces on seafloors or lake bottoms. Trouble is, some other animals and algae inhabit the same sort of modular construction. While <em>Protomelission gatehousei </em>was first described in 1993, scientists didn’t categorize it as a bryozoan until 2021.</p>





<p>Now, analyses of fossils even better preserved than those described previously show that the species may not have been a bryozoan after all, says Martin Smith, a paleobiologist at Durham University in England.</p>



<p>Where previous fossils preserved only the skeletal framework of colonies, the new fossils, unearthed in southern China, include soft parts of the organism too, Smith says. And instead of the tentacles expected to have been found in an immaculately preserved bryozoan, the fossils have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05775-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple leaflike flanges typical of some types of algae</a>, he and colleagues report March 8 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="305" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030723_sp_cambrian-fossils_inline1.jpg" alt="A photo of a fossil shell with a dark brown strip attached to part of it." class="wp-image-3122570" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030723_sp_cambrian-fossils_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030723_sp_cambrian-fossils_inline1-330x148.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122570">New fossils of <em>Protomelission gatehousei </em>(dark brown strip shown attached to a fossil shell) suggest that the species is not the oldest known type of bryozoan after all.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122570">Zhang Xiguang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If borne out, the new find means that the oldest unequivocal bryozoan fossils that are known are only about 480 million years old. That, Smith contends, makes bryozoans the only major group of animals not to have first appeared during the Cambrian Period, a burst of biological diversification that some scientists have referred to as “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites">life’s Big Bang</a>” and which ended about 488 million years ago (<em>SN: 4/24/19</em>).</p>



<p>As a result, the Cambrian was not, as previously thought, a unique interval of innovation in evolutionary history during which all the blueprints of animal life were mapped out, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>“The question is, did evolution lose its ability to create new body plans?” Smith says. The team’s new find suggests not, he says.</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees that the new fossils aren’t bryozoans. The leaflike flanges described by Smith and his colleagues could just as easily be interpreted as body parts of individual animals in the bryozoan colony, says Paul Taylor, an invertebrate paleontologist at London’s Natural History Museum who wasn’t involved in the study.</p>





<p>Because the tentacles that bryozoans use to snatch prey from the water are soft tissue and typically don’t preserve well, their absence from the new fossils is not at all surprising, Taylor notes.</p>



<p>For Taylor, the new findings aren’t sufficient to dismiss <em>P. gatehousei </em>as a Cambrian bryozoan, but they do underline the inherent uncertainty in identifying fossils with simple body plans. More fossils preserving additional features, such as those that preserve the organism’s early growth stages, are needed to settle the question, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/03/the-open-science-atlas/">The Open Science Atlas</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a> with applications and nominations for this year&rsquo;s awards open until <strong>April 30th, 2023</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>. &nbsp;The Einstein Foundation Awards program honors researchers who&nbsp;reflect&nbsp;<strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong>&nbsp;in their work. To get a flavor of what the Einstein Foundation is looking for we have asked last year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their work (watch this space for other finalists in the coming weeks). First up are four researchers (bios and photos at the end of the blog) who are introducing a platform to monitor transparent research practices across scientific disciplines . You can watch a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTa14j3nS_o&amp;t=48s">here</a> and/or read more below.</p>



<h1><a></a><a></a>What?</h1>



<p>The Open Science Atlas<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> will be a web-platform that enables continuous, large-scale monitoring of transparent research practices across the scientific ecosystem. The platform will be driven by a unique data extraction engine that combines global crowdsourcing and automated algorithms to produce living maps of the research transparency landscape. These maps can be explored at various levels of detail, from high-level scientific disciplines, down to individual institutions or journals, and will evolve over time to reveal temporal trends.</p>



<p>This bird&rsquo;s eye view of the transparency landscape will provide an empirical measure of progress, helping us to avoid becoming unduly despondent (because we think nothing is improving) or complacent (because we think everything is fine). The Open Science Atlas will also support further meta-research on the implementation of transparent research practices; for example, whether preregistrations are being properly reported [1] and whether shared data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) [2,3]. In certain situations, the data we gather may support causal inferences about the effectiveness of specific interventions (e.g., journal policy) intended to promote transparency [4]. The results will be available to all on a public data dashboard, motivating and informing community efforts to improve research transparency [5].</p>



<h1><a></a>Why?</h1>



<p>Transparency is a fundamental principle of scientific methodology that is widely neglected in practice. Our research has found that scientists in psychology [6] rarely share data (2%), analysis scripts (1%), or research materials (14%), seldom use preregistration (3%), and only occasionally disclose funding sources (62%) or conflicts of interest (39%) (the situation is similar in the social sciences [7] and biomedicine [8]).</p>



<p>Although many initiatives have been introduced to try and increase adoption of rigorous and transparent research practices [9], there is usually no plan in place to monitor progress. This limits our ability to gauge effectiveness, detect unintended side effects, and identify areas in need of additional attention or support. Monitoring research transparency will facilitate a virtuous cycle in which policy initiatives are strategically designed and refined in response to empirical data, maximizing their benefit [5].</p>



<h1><a></a>How?</h1>



<p>Previous efforts to monitor transparent research practices [6,7] have been limited in scope by the amount of manual labour required to extract information from scientific articles. Text-mining algorithms have shown promise at automating this process [8], but algorithms still require validation against a manually extracted gold standard (i.e., human judgment). Validation also needs to be an ongoing exercise, as reporting of transparency research practices varies across contexts (disciplines, journals, etc.) and will shift over time. The Open Science Atlas will address this problem through its unique data extraction engine that combines (1) automated algorithms and (2) global crowdsourcing.</p>



<p>Our algorithm approach will be based on the prior work of our team member Dr Serghiou, who led the development and validation of text-mining algorithms to measure transparency indicators across 2.75 million open access biomedical articles [8]. We plan to use algorithms because they are functional, not because they are flashy, and we will always be clear about their capabilities and limitations. Whenever the Open Science Atlas uses algorithms, the relevant validation and accuracy statistics will be prominently displayed so users can calibrate their confidence in our results. Moreover, our algorithms will always be open source, so they can be verified and reused by others.</p>



<p>Our crowdsourcing approach will be based on a project led by our team member Dr Mody known as &lsquo;repliCATS&rsquo; [10], and similar projects, like Cochrane Crowd. These projects have demonstrated the feasibility of building large volunteer communities willing to collaborate on meta-scientific projects. For example, repliCATS successfully generated credibility judgements for 4000 social science articles from over 1000 researchers located in over 30 countries.</p>



<p>Contributors to the Open Science Atlas will receive training from our core team, be eligible for various prizes, and be acknowledged for their work on any relevant scientific publications. We will build a semi-automated workflow for article selection, quality control, and data management, which will enable volunteers to contribute to the Atlas whenever it is convenient for them. We will also arrange virtual and in-person hackathons around the world so folks can work alongside each other and get to know each other &mdash; data extraction is much more fun over a shared pizza.</p>



<h1><a></a>What&rsquo;s next?</h1>



<p>We&rsquo;re super excited about the Open Science Atlas, but alas, we did not win the Einstein Award<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. So we are currently seeking funding to help us make our vision a reality. We&rsquo;re also keen to hear from folks who have expertise developing and validating algorithms in scientific contexts who might be interested in working with us. And if you&rsquo;re excited about joining our global community of contributors, let us know and we&rsquo;ll get in touch when we&rsquo;re up and running.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-stars-galaxies-james-webb-space-images">Newborn stars sculpt their galaxies in new James Webb telescope images</a></h4>

              
                <p>A gaggle of galaxies crackle with intricate detail in new images from the James Webb Space Telescope. JWST’s sharp infrared eyes are revealing how newborn stars shape their surroundings, giving hints to how stars and galaxies grow up together.</p>



<p>“We were just blown away,” says Janice Lee, an astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson. She and more than 100 astronomers reported on <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/collections/2041-8205_PHANGS-JWST-First-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists’ first look at these galaxies with JWST</a> in a special February issue of the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>





<p>Before JWST <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">launched in December 2021</a>, Lee and her colleagues selected 19 galaxies that, if observed with the telescope, they thought could reveal new details of the life cycles of stars (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>). These galaxies are relatively close, within 65 million light-years of the Milky Way, and all have different types of spiral structures. The team had observed the galaxies with many observatories, but parts of the galaxies had always looked flat and featureless.</p>



<p>“With [JWST], we’re seeing structure down to the very smallest scales,” Lee says. &#8220;For the first time, we’re seeing the youngest sites of star formation in a lot of these galaxies.”</p>

<p>In the new images, the galaxies’ faces are pockmarked by dark voids amid glowing filaments of gas and dust. Comparisons to Hubble Space Telescope images reveal that these voids are bubbles carved out of the gas and dust by high-energy radiation from newborn stars in their centers.</p>



<p>Then, when the most massive of those stars reach the end of their life and explode, that gas gets pushed out even more. Some of the larger bubbles have smaller bubbles on their edges, which could indicate spots where the gas pushed by dying stars has started to build new stars.</p>



<p>Comparing these processes in different types of spiral galaxies will help astronomers understand how the galaxies’ shapes and properties influence the life cycles of their stars, and how the galaxies grow and change with their stellar denizens.</p>



<p>“We’ve only studied the first few [of the 19 selected] galaxies,” Lee says. “We need to study these things in the full sample to understand how the environment changes … how stars are born.”</p>

<p>It was déjà vu last month when <a href="https://www.vub.be/nl/nieuws/vub-trekt-doctoraatstitel-in-van-abu-hatem-hashim">a university in Belgium stripped</a> Egyptian physician Hatem Abu Hashim of his doctorate after he was found to have fabricated data in his thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just weeks earlier, another Egyptian doctor, Ahmed Badawy, <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/news/utrecht-university-withdraws-doctoral-degree-granted-in-2008">lost the PhD</a> degree he had earned at a Dutch university in 2008. Abu Hashim and Badawy are both <a href="https://medfac.mans.edu.eg/index.php/en/staff-obs-en">professors in the department of obstetrics and gynecology</a> at Mansoura University in Egypt.</p>



<p>According to an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/VCWI_SecondAdvice_2022-01.pdf">investigation</a> by the Vrije Universeit Brussel (VUB), which awarded Abu Hashim his PhD in 2013, the researcher was in &#8220;serious violation of scientific integrity&#8221; based on &#8220;overwhelming evidence of fabrication of statistical outcomes&#8221; and &#8220;clear lack of statistical proficiency.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126655"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ben Mol of Monash University in Australia, a researcher turned <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">data sleuth</a> who alerted VUB and Utrecht University to problems with Abu Hashim and Badawy &#8216;s research in 2021 and 2020, respectively, told Retraction Watch by email, &#8220;The good news is obviously that there is a firm conclusion from both universities after a robust process independent of the complaint.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol also laid out <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">his concerns</a> in a <a href="https://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115%2820%2930184-6/fulltext">study</a> published with then-PhD student Esmée Bordewijk and others in 2020, as Retraction Watch reported that year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it could have been a bit faster, but on the other hand we have this conversation because they took the right decision,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Abu Hashim&#8217;s PhD thesis is based on 11 randomized controlled trials, all of which have been published. Ostensibly, the studies were done at Mansoura University before Abu Hashim enrolled as an external PhD candidate at VUB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/VCWI_SecondAdvice_2022-01.pdf">report from the Flemish Commission for Scientific Integrity</a>, which gave a second opinion on the VUB findings following a request from Abu Hashim, offers a &#8220;credible&#8221; scenario for how the 11 papers came about, suggesting:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>that Abu Hashim had learned to write medical papers by reading others, that he made up all reported values and that he wrote more papers by adapting previous papers, copying results between articles and applying small alterations (+1 or -1 in some digits).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The commission agreed with VUB that &#8220;complete (or virtually complete) fabrication is the only reasonable explanation for the findings.&#8221; It also noted that &#8220;strikingly,&#8221; the researcher did not address any of the allegations against him:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To the contrary, his defence consists mainly of accusing those bringing forward the complaint of misconduct and questioning their work and methods.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Abu Hashim nor Mansoura University responded to requests for comment.</p>



<p>The school, however, has known about Abu Hashim’s fraudulent research for a decade. In an internal investigation from 2014, then-head of department Nasser El Lakany and five other professors found that <a href="https://www.ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2013.24.2.128">one of the researcher’s </a>trials had never been done; six trials included an impossibly large number of women with polycystic ovary syndrome; and two reported 366 ovarian-drilling procedures while records were found to exist only for 94. The latter two groups of studies formed part of Abu Hashim’s PhD thesis.</p>



<p>“There is no excuse for the researcher’ [sic] misconduct (fabricating imaginary data and studies not done at all, or studies with doubtful cases not in records),” the Mansoura professors write, according to an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/English-report-on-Dr-AbuHashim-research.pdf">English translation</a> of the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mansoura-investigation-of-Abu-Hashim_Arabic.pdf">original Arabic report</a>.   </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2021, sleuth Nick Brown also began <a href="https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2021/10/a-catastrophic-failure-of-peer-review.html">poring over</a> the Egyptian researchers&#8217; work after a Dutch journalist requested his opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t read papers. They read the abstract. They say, congratulations, great paper. And then they go back to what they were doing the rest of their day because reading a paper is quite hard,&#8221; Brown told Retraction Watch. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very good at statistics, but I can read a table and things jump out at me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brown quickly realized that Badawy and Abu Hashim&#8217;s publications were littered with &#8220;fatal flaws.&#8221; Virtually all of the <em>P</em>-values were wrong. In some cases, they exceeded 1 – a mathematical impossibility. In others, vastly different values were given for identical statistical tests that by definition should have yielded the same results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I assume the authors were just making up &#8216;likely-looking&#8217; numbers in a hurry and didn&#8217;t realise that these needed to be identical,&#8221; Brown said in an email. &#8220;We often find that people who cheat are not very good at knowing what genuine numbers should look like.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brown, who himself has an external PhD from a Dutch university, noted that institutions receive the same amount of money from the government whether a PhD candidate is external or internal:</p>



<p>&#8220;So someone comes along with some papers already done. They need to write a top and tail of a thesis. They&#8217;re probably not going to need a whole lot of supervision.&nbsp; Exactly how many questions do you ask?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A spokesperson for Utrecht University told Retraction Watch by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have asked ourselves the question how this could have happened. Why did the supervisor and the Doctoral Examination Committee not notice this? The articles that were the basis for the thesis, were published in peer reviewed journals. Only much later it came to light that the data underlying these articles had been compromised.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She added that the rules for external PhD candidates have been tightened since 2008, when Badawy obtained his degree (the changes are described <a href="https://www.uu.nl/nieuws/universiteit-utrecht-trekt-in-2008-verleende-doctorsgraad-in">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Jaspers, a VUB press officer, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is updating its PhD regulations. External PhD students working with existing datasets created at a university other than the VUB and publications reviewed by scientific journals will soon (this spring) be fully audited by the VUB.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, Mol, whose work on various cases recently <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research">featured in <em>The Economist</em></a>, worries about all the fake studies that have not yet been retracted, and the impact they might have on patient care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I cannot understand that &#8230; three years after our publication <a href="https://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115%2820%2930184-6/fulltext">of the Bordewijk study</a>, still half of the Badawy and Abu Hashim studies are out there even without an expression of concern,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What ideally should happen is that there should be a mechanism that all the journals and publishers bundle their investigation.&#8221;</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/fig-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>Across sub-Saharan Africa, maternal and child health initiatives are embracing the use of electronic or mobile technology to improve access to and utilization of skilled obstetric care, especially among marginalized and vulnerable populations. These initiatives have been shown to be successful in increasing the use of health facilities by pregnant women, improving two-way communication between healthcare workers and pregnant women, and increasing women&#8217;s self-efficacy through the dissemination of pertinent health information.</p>
<p>The research team at the Women’s Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC) in Nigeria, led by Professor Friday Okonofua in collaboration with national and international partners and with funding from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the West African Health Organization, began formative, intervention, and implementation research in 2017 to identify innovations and evidence for improving women&#8217;s access to skilled pregnancy care in rural Primary Health Centers (PHCs). During the formative study, we identified transportation as a significant barrier for pregnant women to access existing PHCs.</p>
<p>Multiple qualitative studies with women, men, and community leaders revealed that women resorted to traditional methods of pregnancy care due to a lack of transportation to reach health facilities, especially when labor or complications began at night. This was one of the most important reasons that pregnant women preferred to use unskilled traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who are nearest to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Text4Life intervention was carried out for nearly 24 months, yielding impressive results with no documented maternal deaths.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to this challenge, the team designed a set of interventions to address this barrier, in collaboration with women, community leaders, and policymakers, using community-based participatory research techniques. Text4Life, a RapidSMS system, was developed to respond to the difficulty faced by women in reaching PHCs when they experience pregnancy complications.</p>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>Text4Life was designed to enable two-way communication between women, PHC providers, and transport owners. When a pregnant woman experiences complications such as bleeding, normal or abnormal labor, severe abdominal pain, etc. and she has no means of transportation, she activates an alert system by texting a code from her preregistered phone number to a central server that is linked to all Nigerian telecommunication networks. She initiates the alert herself, or she is assisted by someone else.</p>
<p>When the alert is activated, the Chairman of the Ward Development Committee (WDC) that had been established to register the pregnant women in the community where the woman resides receives the alert and identifies her location. The WDC is an initiative of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health to strengthen community ties and partnerships for the management of PHCs. At the same time, the provider at the closest to the PHC also receives the alert and starts preparations to receive the woman. The WDC chair will then contact one of the authorized and pre-registered transporters (taxi-owners) in the community, who would go to the woman’s home and drive her to the health center. Text4Life includes a reversed billing technique that sends a free alert message.</p>
<p>Text4Life operates on a continuous power source, with a central server connected to the internet and a website. The system includes a platform for registering new pregnancies as well as assistance in monitoring pregnancies throughout the antenatal, birth, and post-partum phases.</p>
<p>A number of capacity-building workshops were organized in the project sites for WDCs, PHC providers, pregnant women (and their spouses or caregivers), and female volunteers to develop capacity among community stakeholders to manage the system. The training included an explanation of the potential pregnancy complications for which women would require urgent transfer. They were also shown how to transmit messages and interpret responses from the central server.</p>
<blockquote><p>This intervention holds a strong promise for improving access to skilled pregnancy care, reducing delays due to lack of transportation, and decreasing the rate of maternal mortality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Health providers were instructed on ways to prepare to receive women as well as the specific actions to take in response to emergencies, such as primary treatment, triaging, and referrals to secondary care hospitals should the need arise. Following the completion of the training, mobile phones were given to PHC healthcare providers and the WDC chairmen. During antenatal care visits, the PHC providers also showed the women how to use the Text4Life app.</p>
<h4>Outcomes and other applications of Text4Life</h4>
<p>As reported in our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05424-9">new paper</a>, the Text4Life intervention was carried out for nearly 24 months, yielding impressive results with no documented maternal deaths in the rural communities. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) Nigeria office is presently utilizing the Text4Life approach to carry out an intervention in 320 communities across nine Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja for women to report cases of gender-based violence (GBV), COVID-19, family planning needs, and unwanted pregnancies.</p>
<p>Women experiencing GBV and other complications can text a code to a central server via their mobile phones. The messages are then relayed to trained nearby health providers and civic society officials, who are expected to provide health care and social management to the distressed callers. The findings show that over a 22-month period, the server received a total of 3,200 reports, with the data currently being analyzed to determine the outcomes of management.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The development of the Text4Life app shows the potential of a quick short message sent from a mobile phone to a central server and linked to community managers, transport providers, and health providers to increase pregnant women&#8217;s access to skilled emergency obstetric services in rural Nigeria. The findings suggest that the intervention is feasible and sustainable, particularly when implemented with the active involvement and ownership by community members. We believe that this intervention holds a strong promise for improving access to skilled pregnancy care, reducing delays due to lack of transportation, and decreasing the rate of maternal mortality in rural Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superconductor-room-temperature-scrutiny">Is this the superconductor of scientists’ dreams? A new claim faces scrutiny</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>LAS VEGAS</strong> — It&#8217;s a bold claim: The quest to create a superconductor that works under practical conditions is finally fulfilled, a team of researchers says. But controversy has dogged the team’s earlier claim of record-breaking superconductivity, and the new result is already facing extreme scrutiny.</p>



<p>The ultimate test will be whether the result can be confirmed by other researchers, says physicist Mikhail Eremets of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany. “I repeat it like [a] mantra: ‘Reproduce.’”</p>





<p>Many materials become superconductors, able to transmit electricity with no resistance, provided they’re cooled to very low temperatures. A few superconductors work under warmer conditions, but those must be squeezed to crushing pressures, so they’re impractical to use.</p>



<p>Now physicist Ranga Dias of the University of Rochester in New York and colleagues say they have <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/K20.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a superconductor that works at both room temperature and relatively low pressure</a>. A superconductor that operates under such commonplace conditions could herald a new age of high-efficiency machines, supersensitive instrumentation and revolutionary electronics.</p>



<p>“This is the start of the new type of material that’s useful for practical applications,”&nbsp;Dias said March 7 at the American Physical Society meeting, where he reported the feat.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05742-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superconductor is made of hydrogen mixed with nitrogen and a rare earth element called lutetium</a>, Dias and colleagues report March 8 in <em>Nature</em>. The team combined the elements and squeezed them in a device known as a diamond anvil cell. The researchers then varied the pressure and temperature and measured the resistance to electrical flow in the compound.</p>



<p>At temperatures as high as 294 kelvins (about 21° Celsius or 70° Fahrenheit), the material seemed to lose any electrical resistance. It still required pressures of 10 kilobar, which is about 10,000 times the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere. But that’s far lower than the millions of atmospheres of pressure typically required for superconductors that operate near room temperature. If confirmed, that makes the material much more promising for real-world applications.</p>



<p>The material displayed several hallmarks of a superconductor, the team reports<em>.</em> Not only did the electrical resistance suddenly drop as it became superconducting, but the material also expelled magnetic fields and exhibited an abrupt change in its heat capacity, Dias says.</p>



<p>When the researchers put the squeeze on the material in the diamond anvil cell, it suddenly turned from a bluish hue to hot pink. “I had never seen a color change like this in a material,” Dias says. “It was like, wow.” That color change indicated a shift in the electrical properties of the material as it became a superconductor, Dias says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="A new material changes color as it becomes a superconductor  | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1aon_Ufq-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Scientists claim to have found a superconductor that works at room temperature and relatively low pressure. If true, that might make it suitable for use in real-world devices. As scientists increase the pressure on the compound, made of hydrogen, lutetium and nitrogen, it changes from blue to pink. This signifies the material changing to a superconductor, in which electricity flows without resistance. Further increasing the pressure causes it to change to red, as it loses its superconducting properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This superconductor might be able to escape the confines of a diamond anvil cell, Dias says, opening it up to practical applications. A technique called strain engineering, for example, could mimic the required pressure. In such a process, researchers grow a material on a surface that constrains growth, putting a strain on the material that replicates the effects of externally applied squeezing.</p>





<p>Still, the research faces significant skepticism, in part because of the firestorm over the team’s earlier publication that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">claimed the discovery of superconductivity</a> in a compound of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen at 15° C (<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>). Editors at <em>Nature</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/room-temperature-superconductor-retraction-physics">retracted that paper</a>, over the objection of Dias and his coauthors, citing irregularities in the researchers’ data handling that undermined the editors’ confidence in the claims (<em>SN: 10/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>Several experts have expressed a lack of confidence in the new results presented by Dias’ group, based on that history. Not only was the previous result retracted, but other researchers were unable to reproduce it, says Eremets, including his own group at the Max Planck Institute. “The main test of validity — reproducibility — was failed, and from my point of view that’s the most important thing.”</p>



<p>The stakes are high. “If it’s true, it’s a great discovery,” says physicist Eugene Gregoryanz of the University of Edinburgh. But he views the researchers with suspicion. “Whether it’s true or not, I guess time will show.”</p>



<p>Others are more positive. “It’s an excellent study,” says materials chemist Russell Hemley of the University of Illinois Chicago. “The data as presented, in terms of evidence for superconductivity, is very strong.” Hemley was not involved with the study but has collaborated with Dias in the past, including on a follow-up to the retracted superconductor paper. Submitted February 16 at arXiv.org, that paper, which has not yet passed peer-review, reports that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the previously claimed superconductor does function</a> near room temperature.</p>



<p>The new superconductor is a hydrogen-rich type known as a hydride. Scientists predict that pure hydrogen should be a room-temperature superconductor, but only at extremely high pressures that make it difficult to produce. To lower the pressure, scientists have added in other elements, making hydride superconductors.</p>



<p>In 2015, Eremets and colleagues produced a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-big-stride-superconductivity">compound of sulfur and hydrogen</a> that was superconducting up to −70° C, a record high temperature at the time (<em>SN: 12/15/15</em>). A few years later, a compound of lanthanum and hydrogen was found to superconduct under still <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hydrogen-rich-compound-may-be-record-breaking-superconductor">&nbsp;chilly conditions, but even closer to room temperature</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/18</em>). Both materials require pressures too high for practical use.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to understand how the new superconductor fits in with other hydrides. Theoretical calculations of how similar hydrides behave wouldn’t suggest that such a material would be superconducting at the reported temperatures and pressures, says theoretical physicist Lilia Boeri of the Sapienza University of Rome. “For me, it looks very strange,” Boeri says. “It’s something completely unexpected…. If it’s true, it’s very different from the other hydrides.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antibody-injection-help-endometriosis">An antibody injection could one day help people with endometriosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>An experimental treatment for endometriosis, a painful gynecological disease that affects some 190 million people worldwide, may one day offer new hope for easing symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monthly antibody injections <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abq5858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reversed telltale signs of endometriosis in monkeys,</a> researchers report February 22 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. The antibody targets IL-8, a molecule that whips up inflammation inside the scattered, sometimes bleeding lesions that mark the disease. After neutralizing IL-8, those hallmark lesions shrink, the team found.</p>



<p>The new treatment is “pretty potent,” says Philippa Saunders, a reproductive scientist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved with work. The study’s authors haven’t reported a cure, she points out, but their antibody does seem to have an impact. “I think it’s really very promising,” she says.</p>



<p>Many scientists think endometriosis occurs when bits of the uterine lining — the endometrium — slough off during menstruation. Instead of exiting via the vagina, they voyage in the other direction: up through the fallopian tubes. Those bits of tissue then trespass through the body, sprouting lesions where they land. They’ll glom onto the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder and other spots outside of the uterus and take on a life of their own, Saunders says. </p>

<p>The lesions can grow nerve cells, form tough nubs of tissue and even bleed during menstrual cycles. They can also kick off chronic bouts of pelvic pain. If you have endometriosis, you can experience “pain when you urinate, pain when you defecate, pain when you have sex, pain when you move around,” Saunders says. People with the disease can also struggle with infertility and depression, she adds. “It’s really nasty.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>Painful symptoms</h3>



<p>Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease, but it can take years before people receive a diagnosis. Here are some signs of the disease:</p>



<ul>
<li>Painful periods</li>



<li>Pain during and/or after sex</li>



<li>Pain during urination and defecation</li>



<li>Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods</li>



<li>Infertility</li>



<li>Fatigue</li>



<li>Diarrhea and/or constipation</li>



<li>Bloating and/or nausea</li>
</ul>



<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">Source: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> </div>
</div>





<p>Once diagnosed, patients face a dearth of treatment options — there’s no cure, only therapies to alleviate symptoms. Surgery to remove lesions can help, but symptoms often come back. </p>



<p>The disease affects at least 10 percent of girls, women and transgender men in their reproductive years, Saunders says. And people typically suffer for years — about eight on average — before a diagnosis. “Doctors consider menstrual pelvic pain a very common thing,” says Ayako Nishimoto-Kakiuchi, a pharmacologist at Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in Tokyo. Endometriosis “is underestimated in the clinic,” she says. “I strongly believe that this disease has been understudied.”</p>



<p>Hormonal drugs that stop ovulation and menstruation can also offer relief, says Serdar Bulun, a reproductive endocrinologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago not involved with the new study. But those drugs come with side effects and aren&#8217;t ideal for people trying to become pregnant. “I see these patients day in and day out,” he says. “I see how much they suffer, and I feel like we are not doing enough.”</p>



<p>Nishimoto-Kakiuchi’s team engineered an antibody that grabs onto the inflammatory factor IL-8, a protein that scientists have previously fingered as one potential culprit in the disease. The antibody acts like a garbage collector, Nishimoto-Kakiuchi says. It grabs IL-8, delivers it to the cell’s waste disposal machinery, and then heads out to snare more IL-8.</p>





<p>The team tested the antibody in cynomolgus monkeys that were surgically modified to have the disease. (Endometriosis rarely shows up spontaneously in these monkeys, the scientists discovered previously after screening more than 600 females.)&nbsp; The team treated 11 monkeys with the antibody injection once a month for six months. In these animals, lesions shriveled and the adhesive tissue that glues them to the body thinned out, too. Before this study, Nishimoto-Kakiuchi says, the team didn’t think such signs of endometriosis were reversible.&nbsp;</p>

Other trials will test new hormonal drugs, robot-assisted surgery and behavioral interventions.</p>



<p>Doctors need new options to help people with the disease, Saunders says. “There’s a huge unmet clinical need.”</p>

                <p>The Association for African Universities (AAU), the Public Library of Science (PLOS), and the Training Centre in Communication (TCC Africa) are pleased to share the results of the first two of <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/expanding-globally-listening-locally-open-science-in-africa/">four regional policy workshops</a> that we are hosting with Presidents, Vice Chancellors, Rectors, Deputy Vice Chancellors, Directors of Research and Libraries in African&nbsp;Higher&nbsp;Education Institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshops aimed to increase education and awareness on the benefits of&nbsp;<strong>Open Science</strong>, to support development and implementation of Open Science policies, and adoption of Open Science&nbsp;and Open Access practices and publishing in African Higher Education Institutions</p>



<p>Workshop programmes included both global and local perspectives on Open Science and its adoption and implementation in institutions, including support and speakers from UNESCO, DORA, University of Leiden, NRF and the African Open Science Platform.</p>



<p>After the workshops, we conducted surveys with attendees to understand progress towards workshop outcomes and potential next steps in the implementation of Open Science policies in universities.</p>



<p><strong>Eastern Africa:</strong></p>



<p>The University of Dar-es-salaam in Tanzania hosted the East African regional workshop, and we had over 150 participants in person and online. After the workshop 97.53% of the workshop respondents had a good understanding of Open Science, and 2.47% had a moderate understanding.</p>



<p>When asked about their plans to support Open Science mandates within their institutes, respondents highlighted they would work with/across institutional leadership in the following ways (percentages area approximate):</p>



<ul><li>19.75% will encourage the integration of OA journals in the university&rsquo;s journal selection strategy</li><li>19.75% will collaborate with library services to promote awareness on Open Science</li><li>18.52% will work on the adoption of professional incentives for academics who employ Open Science-based outputs</li><li>16.05% will work with the Department of Information, Communication, and Technology to assist researcher profiling with Open Software and Hardware</li><li>13.58% will work&nbsp; with the Vice Chancellors&rsquo; Office&nbsp; in supporting the process of&nbsp; the adoption of Open Science in the&nbsp; University with the objective of improving university rankings&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>12.35% will encourage the Directorate of&nbsp; Research to implement the adoption of Open Data and&nbsp; Open Evaluation in the academic&nbsp; writing&nbsp; process</li></ul>



<p><strong>Northern Africa:</strong></p>



<p>The British University in Egypt hosted the North African regional workshop, attracting over 400 participants in person and online. Over 200 took part in the survey and, after the workshop, 85.98% of participants had a better understanding of Open Science and&nbsp; 12.33% had a moderate comprehension.</p>



<p>When asked about their plans to support Open Science mandates within their institutes, respondents highlighted they would work with/across institutional leadership in the following ways (percentages are approximate:</p>



<ul><li>20.49% will collaborate with library services to promote awareness on Open Science</li><li>19.41% will encourage the integration of OA journals in the university&rsquo;s journal selection strategy</li><li>16.80% will work with the Department of Information, Communication, and Technology to assist researcher profiling with Open Software and Hardware</li><li>16.33% will encourage the Directorate of&nbsp; Research to implement the adoption of Open Data and&nbsp; Open Evaluation in the academic&nbsp; writing process</li><li>15.72% will work on the adoption of professional incentives for academics who employ Open Science-based outputs</li><li>11.25% will work&nbsp; with the Vice Chancellors&rsquo; Office&nbsp; in supporting the process of&nbsp; the adoption of Open Science in the&nbsp; University with the objective of improving university rankings&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The workshops were successful in gathering the range of stakeholders necessary to implement change at an institutional level. They show that there is a growing understanding of Open Science among university leaders, with many keen to take proactive steps to support its adoption within their institutes. There is always more to do, and the results highlight the need for continued efforts to build capacity in this area. With more workshops planned across the continent this year, and further activities in development, we are excited to continue our progress towards Open Science adoption in African HE institutions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-flu-mammals-influenza-pandemic">Bird flu can jump to mammals. Should we worry?</a></h4>

              
                <p>An uncomfortable truth is that there is another influenza pandemic in humankind’s future. Whether it will be a relative of the lethal avian flu strain currently wreaking havoc in bird populations around the globe is anyone’s guess.</p>



<p>Because the virus, called H5N1, can be deadly to birds, mammals and people, researchers closely monitor reports of new cases. Worryingly, a new variant of H5N1 that emerged in 2020 has not only spread <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-ebola-monkeypox-mpox-polio-hepatitis-bird-flu-2022">farther than ever before among birds</a>, but has also spilled over into other animals, raising the specter of a human outbreak (<em>SN: 12/12/22</em>).</p>





<p>The variant was linked to <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/recent-increase-seal-deaths-maine-linked-avian-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seal die-off in Maine</a> last summer. In October, there was an <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.3.2300001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H5N1 outbreak on a mink farm in Spain</a>, researchers reported in January in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. (It’s unclear how the mink were exposed, but the animals were fed poultry by-products.) Sea lions off the coast of Peru and wild bears, foxes and skunks, which prey upon or scavenge birds, in the United States and Europe have also tested positive for the virus.</p>



<p>Globally, hundreds of millions of domestic poultry have been culled or died from the new variant. It’s also likely that millions of wild birds have died, though few governmental agencies are counting, says Michelle Wille a viral ecologist at the University of Sydney who studies avian influenza. “This virus is catastrophic for bird populations.”</p>



<p>A handful of human cases have also been reported, though there’s no evidence that the virus is spreading among people. Of seven cases, six people recovered and one person from China died. In February, health officials in China <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/china-reports-new-h5n1-avian-flu-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported an eighth case</a> in a woman whose current condition is unknown.</p>



<p>What’s more, four of the reported human cases — including <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2022-2023/avian-flu-highly-pathogenic.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a U.S. case from Colorado</a> and <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.8.2300107#abstract_content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two workers linked to the Spanish mink farm</a> — were in people who didn’t have any respiratory symptoms. That leaves open the possibility that those people were not truly infected. Instead, tests may have picked up viral contamination, say in the nose, that the people breathed in while handling infected birds. </p>



<p>The impossibility of predicting which avian influenza viruses might make the jump to people and spark an outbreak is in part related to knowledge gaps. These bird pathogens don’t typically easily infect or circulate among mammals including humans. And scientists don’t have a full grasp on how these viruses might need to change for human transmission to occur.</p>



<p>For now, it’s encouraging that so few people have gotten infected amid such a large outbreak among birds and other animals, says Marie Culhane, a food animal veterinarian at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. Still, experts around the globe are diligently watching for any signs the virus may be evolving to spread more easily between people.</p>



<p>The good news is that flu drugs and vaccines that work against the virus already exist, Wille says. Compared with where the world was when the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic came on the scene, “we are already ahead of the game.”</p>





<h4>How the virus would need to change to spread among people is a big unknown</h4>



<p>This new iteration of bird flu is what’s called a highly pathogenic avian influenza, one that is particularly lethal for both domestic and wild birds. Aquatic birds such as ducks naturally carry avian flus with no or minor signs of infection. But when influenza viruses shuffle between poultry and waterfowl, variants with changes that make them lethal to birds can emerge and spread.</p>



<p>Avian viruses can be severe or even deadly for people. Since 2003, there have been 873 human cases of H5N1 infections <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2023-DON445#:~:text=On%2023%20February%202023%2C%20the%20IHR%20NFP%20of%20Cambodia%20notified,treatment%20at%20a%20local%20hospital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported to the World Health Organization</a>. A little less than half of those people died. In February, an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia died after she developed severe pneumonia from an avian flu virus, the country’s first reported infection since 2014. Her father was also infected with the virus — a different variant than the one behind the widespread outbreak in birds —though he has not developed symptoms. It’s unknown how the two people were exposed.</p>



<p>Some of what scientists know about H5N1’s pandemic potential comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/second-two-blocked-flu-papers-released">controversial research on ferrets</a> done more than a decade ago (<em>SN: 6/21/13</em>). Experiments showed that some changes to proteins that help the virus break into cells and make more copies of itself could help the virus travel through the air to infect ferrets, a common laboratory stand-in for humans in influenza research.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>While researchers know these mutations are important in lab settings, it’s still unclear how crucial those changes are in the real world, says Jonathan Runstadler, a disease ecologist and virologist at Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in North Grafton, Mass.</p>

<p>Viruses change constantly, but not all genetic tweaks work together. A change may help one version of the virus transmit better, while also hurting another variant and making it less likely to spread.</p>



<p>“We’re not sure how critical or how big a difference or how much to worry about those mutations when they happen in the wild,” Runstadler says. “Or when they happen five years down the road when there are other changes in the virus’s genetic background that are impacting those [original] mutations.”</p>



<p>That doesn’t stop researchers from trying to pinpoint specific changes. Runstadler and his team look for viruses in nature that have jumped into new animals and work backward to figure out which mutations were crucial. And virologist Louise Moncla says her lab is trying to develop ways to scan entire genetic blueprints of viruses from past outbreaks to look for signatures of a virus that can jump between different animal species.</p>



<p>“There’s a ton that we don’t know about avian influenza viruses and host switching,” says Moncla, of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses of H5N1 circulating on the mink farm in Spain, for instance, revealed a change <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JVI.02642-09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known to help the virus infect mice and mammalian cells</a> grown in the lab. Such a change could make it easier for the virus to spread among mammals, including people. There could have been mink-to-mink transmission on the farm, the researchers concluded, but it remains unclear how much of a role that specific mutation played in the outbreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a numbers game for when influenza viruses with the ability to transmit among mammals might make the jump from birds, Runstadler says. “The more chances you give the virus to spill over and adapt, the higher the risk will be that one of those adaptations will be effective [at helping the virus spread among other animals] or take root and be a real problem.”</p>



<h4>The ongoing outbreak is still a big problem for birds</h4>



<p>Irrespective of our inability to forecast human’s future with H5N1, it’s clear that many species of birds — and some other animals that eat them — are dying now. And more species of birds are dying in this outbreak than previous ones, Culhane and Wille say.</p>



<p>“We have seen huge outbreaks in raptors and seabirds, which were never really affected before,” Wille says. It’s possible that genetic changes have helped the virus to spread more efficiently among birds than previous versions of H5N1, but that’s unknown. “There are a number of studies underway to try and figure it out,” Wille says.</p>

<p>Historically, these deadly avian flus have not been a persistent problem in the Americas, Moncla says. Sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 variants are typically limited to places such as parts of Asia, where the virus has circulated in birds since its emergence in the late 1990s, and northern Africa.</p>



<p>North America’s last big avian flu outbreak was in 2015, when experts <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/2014-2015-hpai-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detected more than 200 cases of a different bird flu virus</a> in commercial and backyard poultry across the United States. The poultry industry culled more than 45 million birds to stop that virus’s spread, Culhane says. “But it didn’t go away from the rest of the world.”</p>



<p>The latest version of H5N1 arrived on North American shores from Europe in late 2021, first popping up in Canada in Newfoundland and Labrador. From there, it spread south into the United States, where so far <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-flu-summary.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tens of millions of domestic poultry</a> have been culled to prevent transmission on farms where the virus has been detected. By December 2022, the virus had made it to South America. In Peru, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bird-flu-kills-sea-lions-thousands-pelicans-perus-protected-areas-2023-02-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tens of thousands of pelicans and more than 700 sea lions</a> have died since mid-January.</p>



<p>It’s important to understand exactly how nonbird animals are getting exposed, Culhane says. Highly pathogenic avian influenzas infect every organ of a bird’s body. So, a fox chowing down on an infected bird is exposing its own mouth, nose and stomach to a lot of virus as it eats its meal. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, experts are keeping an eye on infected animals to raise the alarm early if H5N1 starts transmitting among mammals.</p>



<p>“I do think that the mink outbreak, and then the sea lion outbreak, is a wake-up call,” Moncla says. “We should be doing our very best to implement all the science we can to try and understand what’s happening with these viruses so that if the situation does change, we are better prepared.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shock-waves-shaking-universe-first">Astronomers spotted shock waves shaking the web of the universe for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have caught a glimpse of shock waves rippling along strands of the cosmic web — the enormous tangle of galaxies, gas and dark matter that fills the observable universe.</p>



<p>Combining hundreds of thousands of radio telescope images <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade7233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the faint glow cast as shock waves send charged particles</a> flying through the magnetic fields that run along the cosmic web. Spotting these shock waves could give astronomers a better look at these large-scale magnetic fields, whose properties and origins are largely mysterious, researchers report in the Feb. 17 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Finally, astronomers “can confirm what so far has only been predicted by simulations&nbsp;— that these shock waves exist,” says astrophysicist Marcus Brüggen of the University of Hamburg in Germany, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>At its grandest scale, our universe looks something like Swiss cheese. Galaxies aren’t distributed evenly through space but rather are clumped together <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-image-reveals-structure-cosmic-web">in enormous clusters connected by ropy filaments</a> of dilute gas, galaxies and dark matter and separated by not-quite-empty voids (<em>SN: 10/3/19</em>).</p>



<p>Tugged by gravity, galaxy clusters merge, filaments collide, and gas from the voids falls onto filaments and clusters. In simulations of the cosmic web, all that action consistently sets off enormous shock waves in and along filaments.</p>



<p>Filaments make up most of the cosmic web but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/filament-cosmic-web-set-aglow">are much harder to spot than galaxies</a> (<em>SN: 1/20/14</em>). While scientists have observed shock waves around galaxy clusters before, shocks in filaments “have never been really seen,” says astronomer Reinout van Weeren of Leiden University in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study. “But they should be basically all around the cosmic web.”</p>



<p>Shock waves around filaments would accelerate charged particles through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetic-fields-between-galaxy-clusters">the magnetic fields that suffuse the cosmic web</a> (<em>SN: 6/6/19</em>). When that happens, the particles emit light at wavelengths that radio telescopes can detect&nbsp;— though the signals are very weak.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="509" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022323_ec_cosmic-web-shock-waves_inline.jpg" alt="An image of filaments and clusters in blue waves and pink light dots with a box to the right showing a yellow circle in the middle with a purple ring around it." class="wp-image-3122299" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022323_ec_cosmic-web-shock-waves_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022323_ec_cosmic-web-shock-waves_inline-512x383.jpg 512w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022323_ec_cosmic-web-shock-waves_inline-601x450.jpg 601w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022323_ec_cosmic-web-shock-waves_inline-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022323_ec_cosmic-web-shock-waves_inline-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/022323_ec_cosmic-web-shock-waves_inline-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122299">Simulations of the cosmic web and its magnetic field (cyan), like the one pictured here, predict that shockwaves along filaments and around galaxy clusters should emit weak radio signals (pink). The inset shows what combining many radio images of galaxy cluster pairs in the simulated web might look like, with colors representing gas temperature and density (high values are yellow, low values are purple and black).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122299">F. Vazza, D. Wittor and J. West</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A single shock wave in a filament “would look like nothing, it’d look like noise,” says radio astronomer Tessa Vernstrom of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Crawley, Australia.</p>



<p>Instead of looking for individual shock waves, Vernstrom and her colleagues combined radio images of more than 600,000 pairs of galaxy clusters close enough to be connected by filaments to create a single “stacked” image. This amplified weak signals and revealed that, on average, there is a faint radio glow from the filaments between clusters.</p>





<p>“When you can dig below the noise and still actually get a result&nbsp;— to me, that’s personally exciting,” Vernstrom says.</p>



<p>The faint signal is highly polarized, meaning that the radio waves are mostly aligned with one another. Highly polarized light is unusual in the cosmos, but it is expected from radio light cast by shock waves, van Weeren says. “So that’s really, I think, very good evidence for the fact that the shocks are likely indeed present.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this computer simulation, gas falling onto the cosmic web (blue) heats and expands, setting off shockwaves that ripple through the hot, expanded gas (red) and throughout the vast network of galaxy clusters and filaments that fills our universe. These shockwaves interact with magnetic fields (green) in the cosmic web to create radio signals that astronomers can observe.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The discovery goes beyond confirming the predictions of cosmic web simulations. The polarized radio emissions also offer a rare peek at the magnetic fields that permeate the cosmic web, if only indirectly.</p>



<p>“These shocks,” Brüggen says, “are really able to show that there are large-scale magnetic fields that form [something] like a sheath around these filaments.”</p>



<p>He, van Weeren and Vernstrom all note that it’s still an open question how cosmic magnetic fields arose in the first place. The role these fields play in shaping the cosmic web is equally mysterious.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s one of the four fundamental forces of nature, right? Magnetism,” Vernstrom says. “But at least on these large scales, we don&#8217;t really know how important it is.”</p>

<p>Two journals have dismissed allegations of research misconduct leveled against a&nbsp; political scientist at Harvard in an anonymous memo that labeled his work “pseudoscience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Enos-allegations.pdf">2018 memo</a> signed by “Social Scientists for Research Integrity” – which does not have an internet presence that we could find –&nbsp; makes claims of academic misconduct against <a href="https://www.gov.harvard.edu/directory/ryan-d-enos/">Ryan Enos</a>, who denies any wrongdoing. The journals that published two of Enos’ papers singled out in the memo decided to let the articles stand after investigating the charges. A committee at Harvard University, where Enos is a professor of government and director of the Center for American Political Studies, also reviewed the claims and dismissed them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The allegations primarily concerned purported manipulation of data in Enos’ 2015 article, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12156">What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior</a>,” published in the <em>American Journal of Political Science</em> <em>(AJPS)</em>.

<p>The article explores the theory of racial threat in the context of public housing demolitions in Chicago that displaced more than 25,000 African Americans between 2000 and 2004. He found that before the demolitions, white voters in neighboring communities had turned out in higher numbers and voted more conservatively. The observed effect was related to their proximity to the public housing and the size of the African American population that lived in the developments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The anonymous memo alleged the data had been manipulated, and claimed, “due to these distortions, every single analysis reported in the article… was impacted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enos told Retraction Watch the allegations are untrue and were made in bad faith. “I’m perfectly happy to talk to anybody about it,” he said. “That’s my obligation as a researcher is to answer questions that anybody has about my research and to be fully transparent about it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The allegations were brought to Harvard’s chief research compliance officer in August 2018, according to correspondence shared by Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokesperson. The chair of the Committee on Professional Conduct, Peter Marsden, responded in October 2018, dismissing the case because the allegations “do not fall within the purview of the Standing Committee for Professional Conduct” according to Harvard’s research misconduct policy and procedures.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Dane referred to reports of the allegations on several Substacks, adding:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This has been reported in the media, and we do not consider any of this newsworthy. Further, we have nothing more to say and consider the matter closed, as we have, for some time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She declined to share the identity of the author of the memo, citing limitations under The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) – a law that protects the privacy of student education records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Enos, the memo was written by somebody with a personal grievance who is a former student at Harvard.He said the same person brought the allegations before the Harvard Committee on Professional Conduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked&nbsp;Claudine Gay, Dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences who will become the university&#8217;s president on July 1, about what steps had been taken to address the allegations but received no response.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The same memo appears to have resurfaced four years later after being sent to Chris Brunet, who <a href="https://karlstack.substack.com/p/exclusive-leaked-report-shows-harvard?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web">wrote about it on his blog</a> in March 2022, as did <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/how-not-to-cover-a-social-science">Jesse Singal</a> several days later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors at <em>AJPS</em> said they were first made aware of the allegations in March 2022, but received an “actual complaint” from a member of the political science community in June 2022. The complainant alleged Enos’ data was inconsistent with official election results.</p>



<p>The complaint triggered a formal investigation which found “no credible evidence to support the allegation of academic fraud”, co-editors-in-chief Jennifer Lawless and Kathleen Dolan told Retraction Watch in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to emails between the journal and Enos seen by Retraction Watch, the editors deemed his explanation of the data discrepancy “sufficient to address the complaint.” However, they requested that he draft a memo “addressing the potential implications of the slippage between your data set and the official voter file,” citing “the amount of attention and traction this discrepancy has received.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6549177&amp;version=3.0">four page memo</a> was eventually published on the journal’s dataverse, responding to the criticism that Enos’ replication files include fewer registered voters and a lower voter turnout than the official Chicago records. Enos wrote that the data contains measurement error.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In a call with Retraction Watch, Enos added he has no reason to believe the measurement error would lead to bias in the article’s inferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s absolutely 100% not evidence of fraud and I don’t see how anybody could conclude that,” he said. “Anybody that’s familiar with the data would know there’s going to be discrepancies between voter files and official results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enos later <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/officialresultsmemoenosajps2016.pdf">published another memo</a> on his website responding to the criticism that the number of voter precincts don’t match official records. In short, he explained some of the precincts changed over time, rendering them incomparable in his analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To make that apples to apples comparison, to compare the same place at different points in time, I had to only include the precincts that hadn’t changed,” he said. “A number of precincts are eliminated because of that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other allegations that weren’t explicitly addressed by Enos in his addenda were regarding the purported non-compliance with the <em>AJPS</em> replication policy, the inclusion of people below the age of 17 in the data, and differences with older versions of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The replication files that were made available were ones that matched to the replication policy at the time,” Enos said. The current <em>AJPS</em> Replication and Verification Policy was announced in March 2015, according to the<a href="https://ajps.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ajps-replic-and-verif-policy-2-27-18.pdf"> <em>AJPS</em> website</a> – a month after the journal published Enos’ paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Enos, the inclusion of registered voters below the age of 17 boils down to “a lot of administrative error in these data sets.”</p>



<p>And the differences between the published paper and older iterations of the work were largely because how Enos included people in the dataset changed. He broadened the dataset from&nbsp; January 2000 to October 2000, to include up until the last day that voters could register. “Otherwise I’d be throwing people out of the dataset that could have voted in that election,Enos said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Contrary to what it says in the memo, that didn’t result in any great changes in the paper.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The anonymous memo singled out another one of Enos’ papers, “<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1317670111">Causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes</a>,” which was published in 2014 by the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em> and has been cited 146 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The paper examined how the views on immigration of mostly suburban whites changed after coming into contact with Spanish speakers on a train.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The anonymous memo republished an online comment that criticized the generalizability of Enos’ results and pointed out inconsistencies in the wording of a survey question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/14/political-scientist-asks-for-correction-gets-flip-flop/">we reported in 2018</a>, Enos attempted to set the record straight with the journal after becoming aware of the “mistakenly recorded” survey question in the paper. It eventually resulted in a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1903207116">correction</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, Chris Brunet <a href="https://karlstack.substack.com/p/exclusive-leaked-report-shows-harvard">has alleged on his blog</a> that the whole paper “stinks” because of irregular IP addresses, the presence of infants in the dataset and the removal of the IP addresses from the replication files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research was conducted near Boston but some of the IP addresses are from outside Massachusetts. Enos pointed to the inaccuracy of IP addresses to explain the inconsistencies, and also addressed why he removed the IP addresses from the dataset in <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/ip_geocodes_pnas.pdf">this memo published on his website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to the point that there appear to be infants in the dataset,&nbsp; Enos said the age categories in Qualtrics are recoded into an ordinal variable, meaning a one in the dataset would represent an 18.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I was committing research fraud, why on earth would I have toddlers in the data?” Enos said. “The idea that anybody would be stupid enough to fake data by putting toddlers in, it is absolutely ridiculous.”</p>



<p>When asked about the allegations, a spokesperson for <em>PNAS</em> wrote in an email:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In March 2022, PNAS was notified of concerns regarding this article. After conducting an internal review, the journal concluded that no further action was required. We consider this matter resolved unless new information relating to the PNAS article is brought to our notice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-louisiana-shoreline-stability">The Deepwater Horizon oil spill ruined long-term shore stability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the marshy shores of the Gulf of Mexico were still feeling the effects of the disaster. Marsh grass retained plant-smothering oil, and the soil continued to crumble away at a faster rate than before the spill, causing the shoreline to retreat more rapidly than it would otherwise, a new study shows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following an explosion in April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon rig <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-extent-simulation">pumped nearly 800 million liters of oil</a> into the sea (<em>SN: 2/12/20</em>). The disaster killed dozens of humans and untold sea life. And the oil and its by-products were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-years-deepwater-horizon-oil-spills-impact-lingers">catastrophic for the Gulf ecosystem</a>, both underwater and along the shore (<em>SN: 4/3/15</em>).</p>





<p>But the oil also caused <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123001537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural damage to the shoreline by killing the marsh plants</a> crucial to holding soil in place, researchers report January 25 in <em>Environmental Pollution</em>. That’s making the coast more vulnerable to tropical storms that may be increasing in intensity due to climate change.</p>



<p>“If the plants are compromised in any way, shape or form, you’re going to lose a lot of land,” says Giovanna McClenachan, an ecologist at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, La.</p>



<p>McClenachan was working on her Ph.D. at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge when the disaster happened. She and her supervisor, coastal ecologist Eugene Turner quickly set up research plots in the marshy coast of south Louisiana. Three times a year for the next eight years, they conducted tests on the soil strength with a sheer vane, a common tool farmers use to test soil strength, and analyzed the amount of oil it contained.</p>



<p>They also examined satellite images from 1998 to 2021 to analyze what marsh vegetation looked like before, during and after the spill over a much longer 23-year period.</p>



<p>The field test revealed that, immediately after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the oil concentration of some of the most volatile components of oil, called aromatics, in marsh soil jumped from an average of 23.9 nanograms per gram of sediment before the spill to  17,152 nanograms per gram of sediment in 2011. By 2018, average levels had dropped to 247 nanograms per gram of sediment — but were still more than 10 times higher than before the spill.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="455" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_jrl_deepwater-horizon-soil-stability_inline.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3122205" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_jrl_deepwater-horizon-soil-stability_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_jrl_deepwater-horizon-soil-stability_inline-572x383.jpg 572w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_jrl_deepwater-horizon-soil-stability_inline-673x450.jpg 673w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/021623_jrl_deepwater-horizon-soil-stability_inline-278x186.jpg 278w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122205">The roots beneath the marsh grass ordinarily help to retain soil. When oil kills the grass, the roots die (as seen here) and the soil loosens up.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3122205">Giovanna McClenachan</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Soil strength also declined by half after the spill. Before the spill, the average strength of the top 30 centimeters of soil was 26.9 kilopascals, which measures pressure in physics. The soil strength dropped down to 11.5 kilopascals at a low point in 2011. While the strength then began to recover at a rate of 5 percent per year, it still wasn’t fully recovered by 2018, the last year of the field study, when it had climbed back to 16.4 kilopascals.</p>



<p>This is partly due to the strong storms that have come through in the years since the spill. McClenachan says the initial oil spill killed a lot of plants on what was then the marsh shore. Once those died, the soil retained by the marsh grass roots was loosened and washed away. But the oil remained in the water and got pushed farther into the marsh, where it killed more plants.</p>





<p>“The soil strength hasn’t recovered because there is still oil in the marsh, and that’s causing these really strong erosion events during storms that weren’t occurring prior to the oil spill,” McClenachan says.</p>



<p>Analysis of the satellite images showed that marsh loss rate doubled after the spill. The shoreline along the study area was already receding at 0.8 meters on average per year before the spill due to a combination of natural shifting of the marsh levels and human-caused factors like sea level rise. But that loss increased to nearly 1.7 meters on average per year afterward, although in the 12 months after Hurricane Isaac struck Louisiana in 2012, the marsh receded roughly 2.5 meters.</p>



<p>Some research has questioned whether it’s the oil spill affecting shoreline erosion rather than storms over the past decade. But Hurricane Katrina, which slammed into the Louisiana coast in 2005, years before the oil spill, did not cause nearly the same level of shore loss as much weaker storms after the oil spill, McClenachan’s satellite analysis shows. That suggests it’s not an either/or question; rather the enduring effects of the oil spill made the shoreline more vulnerable to storm damage.</p>



<p>The new study is unique in that it also shows the spill’s effect on the stability of the soil itself, says Scott Zengel, an environmental scientist with Research Planning Inc., a private research consultancy in Tallahassee, Fla., that often analyzes the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p>



<p>“It substantiates the idea that there really was an erosion effect,” he says, adding that the length of the study complements previous research showing oil has played a role in changes to the marsh.</p>



<p>These changes can be mitigated to some extent. Zengel’s work shows that techniques like replanting marsh grass <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18102-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can help decrease the rate of shoreline erosion</a>. For boosting soil retention, he says, “it really points at the plants as being one of the key factors.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-chernobyl-dogs-revealed">What the first look at the genetics of Chernobyl’s dogs revealed</a></h4>

              
                <p>For generations of dogs, home is the radioactive remains of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.</p>



<p>In the first genetic analysis of these animals, scientists have discovered that dogs living in the power plant industrial area are genetically distinct from dogs living farther away.</p>



<p>Though the team could distinguish between dog populations, the researchers <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not pinpoint radiation</a> as the reason for any genetic differences. But future studies that build on the findings, reported March 3 in <em>Science Advances,</em> may help uncover how radioactive environments leave their mark on animal genomes.</p>





<p>That could have implications for other nuclear disasters and even human space travel, says Timothy Mousseau, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. “We have high hopes that what we learn from these dogs … will be of use for understanding human exposures in the future,” he says.</p>



<p>Since his first trip in 1999, Mousseau has stopped counting how many times he’s been to Chernobyl. “I lost track after we hit about 50 visits.”</p>



<p>He first encountered Chernobyl’s semi-feral dogs in 2017, on a trip with the Clean Futures Fund+, an organization that provides veterinary care to the animals. Not much is known about how local dogs survived after the nuclear accident. In 1986, an explosion at one of the power plant’s reactors kicked off a disaster that lofted vast amounts of radioactive isotopes into the air. Contamination from the plant’s radioactive cloud largely settled nearby, in a region now called the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.</p>



<p>Dogs have lived in the area since the disaster, fed by Chernobyl cleanup workers and tourists. Some 250 strays were living in and around the power plant, among spent fuel-processing facilities and in the shadow of the ruined reactor. Hundreds more roam farther out in the exclusion zone, an area about the size of Yosemite National Park.</p>

<p>During Mousseau’s visits, his team collected blood samples from these dogs for DNA analysis, which let the researchers map out the dogs’ complex family structures. “We know who’s related to who,” says Elaine Ostrander, a geneticist at the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Md. “We know their heritage.”</p>



<p>The canine packs are not just a hodgepodge of wild feral dogs, she says. “There are actually families of dogs breeding, living, existing in the power plant,” she says. “Who would have imagined?”</p>





<p>Dogs within the exclusion zone share ancestry with German shepherds and other shepherd breeds, like many other free-breeding dogs from Eastern Europe, the team reports. And though their work revealed that dogs in the power plant area look genetically different from dogs in Chernobyl City, about 15 kilometers away, the team does not know whether radiation caused these differences or not, Ostrander says. The dogs may be genetically distinct simply because they’re living in a relatively isolated area.</p>



<p>The new finding is not so surprising, says Jim Smith, an environmental scientist at the University of Portsmouth in England. He was not part of the new study but has worked in this field for decades. He’s concerned that people might assume “that the radiation has something to do with it,” he says. But “there’s no evidence of that.”</p>



<p>Scientists have been trying to pin down <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/some-birds-adapt-chernobyls-radiation">how radiation exposure at Chernobyl has affected wildlife</a> for decades (<em>SN: 5/2/14</em>). “We’ve been looking at the consequences for birds and rodents and bacteria and plants,” Mousseau says. His team has found animals with elevated mutation rates, shortened life spans and early-onset cataracts.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to tease out the effects of low-dose radiation among other factors, Smith says. “[These studies] are so hard … there’s lots of other stuff going in the natural environment.” What’s more, animals can reap some benefits when humans leave contaminated zones, he says.</p>



<p>How, or if, radiation damage is piling up in dogs’ genomes is something the team is looking into now, Ostrander says. Knowing the dogs’ genetic backgrounds will make it easier to spot any radiation red flags, says Bridgett vonHoldt, an evolutionary geneticist at Princeton University, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“I feel like it’s a cliffhanger,” she says. “I want to know more.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-worlds-earliest-horseback-riders">The Yamnaya may have been the world’s earliest known horseback riders</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> — The tale of the first horseback riders may be written on the bones of the ancient Yamnaya people.</p>



<p>Five excavated skeletons dated to about 3000 to 2500 B.C. show clear signs of physical stress that hint <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these Yamnaya individuals may have frequently ridden horses</a>, researchers reported March 3 at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting and in <em>Science Advances</em>. That makes the Yamnaya the earliest humans identified as likely horseback riders so far.</p>





<p>Five thousand years ago, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">Yamnaya migrated widely</a>, spreading <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-how-migrations-shaped-south-asian-language-farming">Indo-European languages</a> and altering the human gene pool across Europe and Asia (<em>SN: 11/15/17; SN: 9/5/19</em>). Their travels eventually stretched from modern-day Hungary to Mongolia, roughly 4,500 kilometers, and are thought to have taken place over only a couple of centuries.</p>



<p>“In many ways, [the Yamnaya] changed the history of Eurasia,” says archaeologist Volker Heyd of the University of Helsinki.</p>



<p>Horse <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-evidence-rewriting-domestication-origin-stories">domestication</a> became widely established around 3500 B.C., probably for milk and meat (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>). Some researchers have suggested the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/horse-domestication-traced-ancient-central-asian-culture">Botai people in modern-day Kazakhstan</a> started riding horses during that time, but that&#8217;s debated (<em>SN: 3/5/09</em>). The Yamnaya had horses as well, and archaeologists have speculated that the people probably rode them, but evidence was lacking.</p>



<p>But the oldest known depictions of horseback riding are from about 2000 B.C. Complicating efforts to determine when the behavior emerged, possible riding gear would have been made of long-decayed natural materials, and scientists rarely, if ever, find complete horse skeletons from that time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_mp_horseback-rider_inline2.jpg" alt="A photo of a limestone relief showing someone bareback riding on a horse while others complete a variety of tasks." class="wp-image-3122451" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_mp_horseback-rider_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/030223_mp_horseback-rider_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3122451">The earliest depictions of horseback riding date to about 4,000 years ago, although a new study suggests some Yamnaya people were riding horses around 1,000 years earlier.

<p>Heyd and colleagues weren’t seeking evidence of horsemanship. They were working on a massive project called the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/the-yamnaya-impact-on-prehistoric-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yamnaya Impact on Prehistoric Europe</a> to understand every aspect of the people’s lives.</p>



<p>While assessing over 200 human skeletons excavated from countries including Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, bioanthropologist Martin Trautmann noticed that one individual’s bones carried distinct traits on the femur and elsewhere that he’d seen before. He immediately suspected horseback riding.</p>





<p>“It was just kind of a surprise,” says Trautmann, also of the University of Helsinki.</p>



<p>If it were a one-off case, he says he would have dismissed it. But as he continued analyzing skeletons, he noticed that several had the same traits.</p>



<p>Trautmann, Heyd and colleagues assessed all the skeletons for the presence of six physical signs of horseback riding that have been documented in previous research, a constellation of traits dubbed horsemanship syndrome. These signs included pelvis and femur marks that could have come from the biomechanical stress of sitting with spread legs while holding onto a horse, as well as healed vertebrae damage from injuries that could have come from falling off. The team also created a scoring system to account for the skeletal traits’ severity, preservation and relative importance.</p>



<p>“Bones are living tissue,” Trautmann says. “So they react to any type of environmental stimulus.”</p>



<p>The team deemed five Yamnaya male individuals as frequent horseback riders because they had four or more signs of horsemanship. Nine other Yamnaya males probably rode horses, but the researchers were less confident because the skeletons each displayed only three markers.</p>

<p>“Hypothetically speaking, it’s very logical,” says bioarchaeologist Maria Mednikova of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, who was not involved in the new study. The Yamnaya were very close to horses, she says, so at some point, they probably experimented with riding.</p>



<p>She now plans to check for the horse-riding traits in the Yamnaya skeletons she has access to. “The human skeletal system is like a book — if you have some knowledge, you can read it,” Mednikova says.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Ursula Brosseder, who also was not involved in the work, warns not to interpret this finding as equestrianism reaching its full bloom within the Yamnaya culture. Brosseder, formerly of the University of Bonn in Germany, sees the paper’s discovery as humans still figuring out what they could do with horses as part of early domestication.</p>



<p>As for Heyd, he says he has long suspected that the Yamnaya rode horses, considering that they had the animals and expanded so rapidly across such a large area. “Now, we have proof.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-spacex-problem-space-pollution">Half of all active satellites are now from SpaceX. Here’s why that may be a problem</a></h4>

              
                <p>SpaceX’s rapidly growing fleet of Starlink internet satellites now make up half of all active satellites in Earth orbit.</p>



<p>On February 27, the aerospace company <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=sl6-1-pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched 21 new satellites</a> to join its broadband internet Starlink fleet. That brought the total number of active Starlink satellites to 3,660, or about <a href="https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 percent of the nearly 7,300 active satellites in orbit</a>, according to analysis by astronomer Jonathan McDowell using data from SpaceX and the U.S. Space Force.</p>





<p>“These big low-orbit internet constellations have come from nowhere in 2019, to dominating the space environment in 2023,” says McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. “It really is a massive shift and a massive industrialization of low orbit.”</p>



<p>SpaceX has been launching Starlink satellites since 2019 with the goal of bringing broadband internet to remote parts of the globe. And for just as long, astronomers have been warning that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy">bright satellites could mess up their view of the cosmos</a> by leaving streaks on telescope images as they glide past (<em>SN: 3/12/20</em>).</p>



<p>Even the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits more than 500 kilometers above the Earth’s surface, is vulnerable to these satellite streaks, as well as those from other satellite constellations. From 2002 to 2021, the percentage of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01903-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubble images affected by light from low-orbit satellites increased by about 50 percent</a>, astronomer Sandor Kruk of the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, and colleagues report March 2 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The number of images partially blocked by satellites is still small, the team found, rising from nearly 3 percent of images taken between 2002 and 2005 to just over 4 percent between 2018 and 2021 for one of Hubble’s cameras. But there are already thousands more Starlink satellites now than there were in 2021.</p>



<p>“The fraction of [Hubble] images crossed by satellites is currently small with a negligible impact on science,” Kruk and colleagues write. “However, the number of satellites and space debris will only increase in the future.” The team predicts that by the 2030s, the probability of a satellite crossing Hubble’s field of view any time it takes an image will be between 20 and 50 percent.</p>

<p>The sudden jump in Starlink satellites also poses a problem for space traffic, says astronomer Samantha Lawler of the University of Regina in Canada. Starlink satellites all orbit at a similar distance from Earth, just above 500 kilometers.</p>



<p>“Starlink is the densest patch of space that has ever existed,” Lawler says. The satellites are constantly navigating out of each other’s way to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-satellites-collide-earth-orbit">avoid collisions</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/09</em>). And it’s a popular orbital altitude — Hubble is there, and so is the International Space Station and the Chinese space station.</p>





<p>“If there is some kind of collision [between Starlinks], some kind of mishap, it could immediately affect human lives,” Lawler says.</p>



<p>SpaceX launches Starlink satellites roughly once per week — it launched 51 more on March 3. And they’re not the only company launching constellations of internet satellites. By the 2030s, there could be 100,000 satellites crowding low Earth orbit.</p>



<p>So far, there are no international regulations to curb the number of satellites a private company can launch or to limit which orbits they can occupy.</p>



<p>“The speed of commercial development is much faster than the speed of regulation change,” McDowell says. “There needs to be an overhaul of space traffic management and space regulation generally to cope with these massive commercial projects.”</p>

<p>In November of 2020, an economics professor wrote to the editor-in-chief of a journal with two requests: remove his name from an online paper on which he was the corresponding author, and retract the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than two years later, neither of those things has happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, the article, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijfe.2173">Outward foreign direct investment and economic growth in Romania: Evidence from non-linear ARDL approach</a>,” which appeared in August&nbsp; 2020 in the <em>International Journal of Finance and Economics</em>, was included in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/10991158/2022/27/1">January 2022 issue of the journal</a>. It has been cited 10 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A scholar who was involved in the work but left off the paper has provided evidence, seen by Retraction Watch, that the published article contains falsified data. Two of the paper’s authors also have had another article they co-authored together retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126630"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The authors of the paper are listed as Azka Amin, an assistant professor of business administration at Iqra University in Pakistan, Sofia Anwar, a professor of economics and management sciences at Government College and University in Pakistan, and Xi-Hua Liu, a professor of economics at Qingdao University in China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Nov. 30, 2020, Liu, the corresponding author on the work, emailed&nbsp; Michael P. Dooley, then the top editor of the journal, requesting retraction. In the email, which we obtained, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am writing this mail in a great hour of difficulty I would like to grab your attention toward a very sensitive issue. First of all, I request you to remove my name from “Outward foreign direct investment and economic growth in Romania: Evidence from non-linear ARDL approach, Int J Fin Econ, (2020),<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002ljfe.2173"> https://doi.org/10.1002ljfe.2173</a>” published recently on dated “6 July, 2020.”</p>



<p>Now I would like to explain the reasons for requesting the withdraw. The reason behind is that its first author Azka Amin and her classmate (a student named Usman Ali student of the Dalian University of Technology) disputed the ownership of this paper. I cannot actually judge their respective contributions to this paper. However, from their emails we should be able to judge that Usman Ali made an important academic contribution. More importantly, I did not even know about the paper that Azka Amin submitted to your journal, and I did not even know about listing me as the corresponding author.</p>



<p>Based on the above facts, I would like to request you to remove my name from the paper. In addition, I hope you will carefully consider Azka Amin’s academic ethics and withdraw this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ali, a postdoctoral fellow at Dalian University of Technology in China, told us that, in addition to not including him as an author, the study included “fabricated data and results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Ali, the research detailed in the paper was a collaboration between him, Amin, and Liu. The paper was originally submitted to the <em>Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting</em>, but the journal rejected it, which Ali said he was unaware of at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali discovered in September 2020 that the paper had been published without his knowledge. His name was left off the author list, and another author, Anwar, who Ali said was not involved in the research, was added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali said he asked Amin to withdraw the paper, but instead, she requested that the journal add an author to the paper, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. Ali said Amin did so without his consent.&nbsp; But Ali said he told her he did not want his name added to the paper because some of its results had been changed from the original and were “bogus.” In any case, Ali said the journal never reached out to him about adding his name to the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ali also provided documents that he said show that data from the original, rejected manuscript were changed in the published study. For example, the published paper stated that its data cover the years between 1990 and 2019, but a screen capture of what Ali said was the original dataset seems to show a time period of 1990 to 2017. The original manuscript submitted to the <em>Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting</em>, which Ali also included, indicated the data were from 1990-2017, as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet the results in the published paper “are exactly the same as those in the original manuscript,” Ali wrote, “with some exceptions of the fabricated results.” Specifically, Ali said some standard error values and p values were changed from positive to negative, and he included screen captures as corroboration.</p>



<p>In 2021, a paper on which Liu and Amin were both authors was retracted from the journal <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>, because “an investigation by the Academic Committee of the School of Economics of Qingdao University established significantly overlaps with an unpublished manuscript by different authors,” according to the<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-18040-x"> retraction note</a>.</p>



<p>Amin, Anwar, and Liu did not respond to emails from Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">We don’t know if the journal ever responded to Liu. His name still appears as corresponding author on the online article, which has not been retracted or marked with any sort of editor’s note.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keith Pilbeam, the current editor-in-chief, told us the matter was still under investigation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This paper was published in the International Journal of Finance and Economics prior to the new editorial board taking over in November 2021. However, it is currently under investigation by Wiley Integrity in Publishing Group and as far as I know is currently being actively investigated so that a decision can be made on what to do in regards to this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, the journal’s publisher, responded to a follow-up email, saying:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have been actively investigating this article in accordance with COPE guidelines. The concerns shared here were not previously known to Wiley and will now be addressed as part of the ongoing investigation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Wiley nor Pilbeam answered questions from Retraction Watch about the reason for the years-long delay in retracting the study or why the journal has not added an indication of its investigation, such as an expression of concern, to the study.</p>



<p>Ali told us that trying to get the study retracted has been “a difficult and stressful experience”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is particularly concerning and disappointing when the journal chooses to publish a paper in a regular Issue despite having been informed of the serious ethical problems beforehand. I think it is a disregard for ethical considerations and a failure to take responsibility for the potential harm that may result from the publication of such research.</p>

                <p>A nebulous void in Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza has been unveiled thanks to strange subatomic particles called muons.</p>



<p>Scientists first identified the void in 2016 using muons, heavy relatives of electrons that can penetrate through solid materials. Thought to be a corridor-shaped hole, the void was located near a chevron-shaped structure visible on the pyramid’s north face. Further muon measurements revealed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36351-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new details of the void’s size and shape</a>, scientists from the ScanPyramids team report March 2 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>

Procureur <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Communications</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new muon measurements indicate that the void is a 9-meter-long corridor about 2 meters wide by 2 meters tall, close to the pyramid’s north face. ScanPyramids researchers made additional measurements with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963869523000245?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ground-penetrating radar and ultrasonic testing</a>, they reported March 2 in <em>NDT &amp; E International</em>.&nbsp;The detailed measurements allowed the scientists to use an endoscope to take images inside the chamber, the team announced. The images reveal a corridor with a vaulted ceiling, presumably one that was hasn’t been seen by humans since the pyramid was built more than 4,500 years ago. The corridor’s purpose is still unclear.</p>

<p>Muons are created when high-energy particles from space called cosmic rays crash into the Earth’s atmosphere. Muons are partially absorbed as they rain down onto structures such as the pyramids. Using detectors placed inside the pyramid, scientists from ScanPyramids zeroed in on regions where more muons made it through, indicating they’d traversed less material, which let them map out the location of the void.</p>



<p>Scientists also recently used muons to probe an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-scan-mystery-ancient-chinese-wall">ancient Chinese wall</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/23</em>), a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq8431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear reactor</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">various volcanoes</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>
