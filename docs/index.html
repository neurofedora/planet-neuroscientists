<p>Eight papers by two emeritus researchers from Duke University have been retracted in recent months for alleged image duplications. Although the researchers had worked at the university for decades, Duke officials have not responded to repeated inquiries about the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers were published between 2004 and 2014 in <em>The Journal of Cellular Biochemistry</em> and <em>PLOS One.</em> According to the retraction statements, the articles contained images and figures that appeared similar or identical to others in the same paper or published elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two researchers, Salvatore Pizzo, a former chair of Duke’s Department of Pathology, and his colleague Uma Kant Misra, spent much of their careers studying prostate cancer.&nbsp; From 1993 to 2015, Pizzo and Misra published 70 papers together, with 26 where they are the only authors. Pizzo did not respond to repeated emails from Retraction Watch asking for comment. Misra <a href="https://www.poolefuneral.com/obituaries/Dr-Uma-Kant-Misra-Ph-D?obId=45480361">died Sept. 18</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132977"></span>



<p>Multiple emails and phone calls to members of the Duke media relations team and to research integrity staff over the course of five weeks have gone unanswered. Duke has been at the center of several misconduct cases that have resulted in, among other penalties, sanctions from the National Institutes of Health following <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/22/nih-to-lift-duke-sanctions-stemming-from-misconduct/">revelations about misconduct in cancer trials</a>, a $112.5 million settlement in <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/910871?form=fpf">a whistleblower lawsuit</a>, and a rare <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/31/feds-ban-ex-duke-lab-tech-from-funding-after-she-faked-data-linked-to-60-nih-grants/">permanent ban</a> from federal funding by the U.S. Office of Research Integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On PubPeer, commenters <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/59082D6520B852EEBE23AFA834D825">noted</a> that several papers authored by Pizzo and Misra contained images or figures that appeared to be similar or identical to images used in other papers by the two scientists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes <em>The Journal of Cellular Biochemistry</em>, where five of the retracted articles appeared, told us the company was aware of the critiques and had “received numerous secondary concerns from third parties.” The articles, retracted July 15-16, all had image duplication issues. “In all instances, these image elements have been used to represent different experimental conditions,” three of the five notices stated.</p>



<p>The retracted Wiley papers are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcb.20233">Activation of Akt/PDK Signaling in Macrophages Upon Binding of Receptor-Recognized Forms of α2-Macroglobulin to Its Cellular Receptor: Effect of Silencing the CREB Gene</a>, published in Sept. 9, 2004, 15 citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</li>



<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcb.22016">Transcription factor TFII-I causes transcriptional upregulation of GRP78 synthesis in prostate cancer cells</a>, published Dec. 18, 2008, 33 citations.&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcb.22333">Epac1-Induced Cellular Proliferation in Prostate Cancer Cells Is Mediated by B-Raf/ERK and mTOR Signaling Cascades</a>, published Sept. 1, 2009, 60 citations.</li>



<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcb.24018">Upregulation of mTORC2 Activation by the Selective Agonist of EPAC, 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP, in Prostate Cancer Cells: Assembly of a Multiprotein Signaling Complex</a>, published Dec. 15, 2011, 38 citations.</li>



<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcb.23083">Loss of Cell Surface TFII-I Promotes Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells Stimulated With Activated α2-Macroglobulin</a>, published Feb. 24, 2011, 13 citations.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;<em>PLOS One </em>&nbsp;decided to retract three articles by the pair “due to unresolved image concerns that call into question the integrity and reliability of the reported results and conclusions,” Maria Zalm, senior editor of publication ethics at PLOS, told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>PLOS One</em> papers retracted in June are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051735">Receptor-Recognized α2-Macroglobulin Binds to Cell Surface-Associated GRP78 and Activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells,</a> published Dec. 14, 2012, 32 citations.</li>



<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063150">Evidence for a Pro-Proliferative Feedback Loop in Prostate Cancer: The Role of Epac1 and COX-2-Dependent Pathways</a>, published April 30, 2013, 31 citations.</li>



<li><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088373">Activated α2-macroglobulin binding to cell surface GRP78 induces T-loop phosphorylation of Akt1 by PDK1 in association with raptor,</a> published Feb. 6, 2014, 18 citations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Zalm said the journal’s investigation began after “multiple readers” brought concerns to the editors about images in the articles.</p>



<p>According to Zalm, Pizzo responded to early editorial communications related to the concerns, but he did not respond to the decision to retract the work. Misra did not respond to any of the journal’s communications, she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the three retracted articles, PLOS found problematic images in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098021">another article</a> by the two researchers, but decided that these concerns should be addressed with an editorial note rather than a full retraction. The publisher also performed an “initial assessment” of other articles by Pizzo and Misra and did not identify similar concerns.</p>

<p>Taylor &amp; Francis has threatened legal action against an online group that has made allegations, based largely on vague insinuations rather than evidence, about the publisher and a member of its research integrity team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group, <a href="https://scienceguardians.com/">ScienceGuardians</a>, is an anonymous organization whose website serves as what they call an online “journal club.” On X, it has been posting so-called “investigations” of several sleuths, publishers and organizations, what it calls “perpetrators of the PubPeer Network Mob.” Its targets have included sleuths <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1965472156869173461">Kevin Patrick</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1916204920329670817">Reese Richardson</a>, and others such as <em>Science </em>editor-in-chief <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1965804281761558759">Holden Thorp</a>, and its posts are <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/10/wafik-el-deiry-nci-director-candidate-science-guardians-twitter-pubpeer-sleuths/">often amplified</a> by those whose work has been questioned on PubPeer or retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 7, the group published <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1964740406853185692">a string of claims</a> on X about Nick Wise, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">a sleuth</a> who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/18/nick-wise-sleuth-publisher-taylor-francis/">joined Taylor &amp; Francis</a> in January as a research integrity manager. The ScienceGuardians post characterized the move as Wise “infiltrated” the publisher’s research integrity office. The post states he is responsible for 1,300 posts on PubPeer (which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">we have noted</a> he does under <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=n.+h.+wise">his real name</a>), and, ScienceGuardians claims, more than 100 others under the name “Simnia avena.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132954"></span>



<p>“These inflammatory words suggest that something illegal or secret has occurred, although it seems more likely that T&amp;F hired Nick because of his sleuthing experience,” said sleuth Elisabeth Bik, who has also been <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1945513864142946338">called out</a> by ScienceGuardians. “They also accuse Nick and other sleuths of using &#8216;fake accounts&#8217; on PubPeer, even though many of us sleuths might use or have used pseudonyms out of fear of being sued. It is not a crime or fraud to use a pseudonym. In fact, ScienceGuardians are hiding behind one as well.”</p>



<p>On September 8, the group sent a “formal notice” to Taylor &amp; Francis, which they <a href="https://scienceguardians.substack.com/p/formal-notice-regarding-conflicts">also posted on Substack</a>, to the attention of Laura Wilson, head of research integrity and ethics, and Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics and integrity. Among its “material concerns,” the letter cites “conflicts of interest,” referencing Wise’s PubPeer posts, and whether he “disclosed his PubPeer activity” to the publisher. They also cite “collaboration with external actors,” referencing an exchange on Bluesky between Wise and Bik. The letter was signed by “Elias Verum, on behalf of ScienceGuardians.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alam responded 10 days later in an email, the text of which ScienceGuardians posted online. “Your email and social media posts include several significant allegations about a particular individual at Taylor &amp; Francis,” Alam wrote. The integrity team “committed to upholding the highest standards of research integrity and publishing ethics, as well as identifying and preventing unethical practices.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis takes such allegations very seriously. However, we note that you have not provided any evidence to support these allegations. If you have evidence to verify your claims, please share this with us and we will investigate accordingly. If you do not have such evidence, the substance of your email and social media posts are serious and highly defamatory, and have been disseminated by you to more than 3000 followers on the social media platform X. If you cannot substantiate these claims, then we insist that you retract these claims immediately.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>If you continue to make these serious allegations without providing evidence of same, then we will have no choice but to refer this matter to our legal department and consider pursuing legal action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for the publisher verified the correspondence reproduced in the posts as accurate but did not respond to further questions regarding the matter. Wise did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ScienceGuardians has sent <a href="https://scienceguardians.substack.com/p/taylor-and-francis-under-notice-their">two</a> <a href="https://scienceguardians.substack.com/p/taylor-and-francis-formal-notice">subsequent</a> replies to the publisher for what it deems “extremely significant concerns.”</p>



<p>In its response on September 20, ScienceGuardians repeated and linked to the allegations they posted on X, calling them “specific, archived evidence that supports the material concerns set out in our notice.” They continued, “For clarity, your threat of legal action does not relieve Taylor &amp; Francis of its duty of care to the academic community.”</p>



<p>In a second follow-up email sent September 22, ScienceGuardians requested Taylor &amp; Francis tell them whether Wise has access to the <a href="https://stm-assoc.org/what-we-do/strategic-areas/research-integrity/integrity-hub/">STM Integrity Hub</a>, and if so, what permissions, data access and activity he has carried out, among other details of integrity research and work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In past posts, the group has also singled out Retraction Watch, with <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1934331058272772585">claims</a> <a href="https://x.com/SciGuardians/status/1964740406853185692">including</a> that this site is the “institutional-level predatory arm of the PubPeer Network Mob.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is disturbing that ScienceGuardians not only post their vague insinuations on X, but that they also send emails to the employers of &#8216;sleuths&#8217; in a clear attempt at defamation,” Bik told us. The account “uses accusatory language such as &#8216;malicious activities&#8217;, &#8216;entrapment&#8217;, &#8216;implicated&#8217;, and &#8216;exposing&#8217;, without actually showing any proof of fraudulent activities. “It is likely that these vague insinuations are costing the sleuths&#8217; employers a lot of time and headaches.”</p>

                <p>Today (September 25, 2025) arXiv login was down from about 12:00 to 15:00 EDT. This occurred due to a confluence of technical issues, the majority of which we have now fixed. Some of these technical issues have been plaguing the arXiv system for the past week, but we believe this current fix will allow for smooth and uninterrupted service for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>During the outage, only submissions, account maintenance (such as email or password changes) and Postscript downloads were affected. arxiv.org was still available to readers, and finding and viewing papers was not affected.</p>
<p>One of fixes we have implemented is the temporary suspension of the ability to download Postscript files. While this is a rarely used legacy feature, the excessive amount of requests from harvesting bots overwhelmed the feature, which also exacerbated inefficiencies in our ancient implementation. This feature is only temporarily suspended &#8211; as arXiv continues to update and modernize our technology systems, Postscript downloads will be restored when we are better able to support them efficiently.</p>
<p>We apologize for the interruption, and we will keep readers and authors updated as our development team implements fixes and updates to arxiv.org. As always, any outages, issues, or interruptions of service to arxiv.org will be promptly posted and updated on the <a href="https://status.arxiv.org/">arxiv.org Operational Status page</a>.</p>

<p><em>PLOS One</em> has retracted a paper linking vitamin D levels and COVID-19 morbidity three years after a critic flagged the data in the study as “deeply bizarre.” The authors objected to the retraction, with one calling it “outrageous” and pointing to flaws in the published notice.</p>



<p>The article, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263069">which appeared</a> in February 2022, claimed people with low levels of vitamin D were at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and were more likely to die of the disease than other patients. It has been cited 65 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper had a “huge, immediate impact,” said <a href="https://gidmk.substack.com/">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, a senior research fellow from the University of Wollongong in Australia, citing the fact that the paper had been <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263069#viewedHeader">viewed over 1 million times</a> within six weeks of being published. The article <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/24/paper-recommending-vitamin-d-for-covid-19-retracted-four-years-after-expression-of-concern/">join</a>s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/04/22/covid-19-vitamin-d-paper-retracted-by-springer-nature-journal/">others</a>, many also flagged by Meyerowitz-Katz, purporting to find links between vitamin D intake and COVID-19 severity that have been retracted or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/19/widely-shared-vitamin-d-covid-19-preprint-removed-from-lancet-server/">removed</a>.</p>



<span id="more-132910"></span>



<p>In an April 2022 <a href="https://x.com/GidMK/status/1519084394840952832">thread on X, </a>Meyerowitz-Katz noted the study’s “MASSIVE effect, whereby virtually everyone who died” had vitamin D levels below the normal range, he wrote at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz also wrote that, while the paper had “no obvious signs of fakery,” the data were “deeply bizarre.” He noted all of the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the study also had hypertension, a trend not in itself unusual besides the complete overlap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study considered low vitamin D levels to be less than 20 ng/mL, and 15 people had a vitamin D level of exactly 10 ng/mL. Ten of those 15 died, a larger percentage than any other bracket. “This makes having a vitamin D of exactly 10ng/mL the most dangerous range seen in the study,” Meyerowitz-Katz wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0331693">September 8 notice</a> cites a “fatal flaw” with the study design “which prevents testing of the hypothesis.” David Knutson, the head of communications at PLOS, told us the flaw refers to the fact the authors included only patients who had already been tested for vitamin D. The notice states the fact the patients had been previously assessed for vitamin D levels and that that level may have changed prior to COVID-19 infection may have introduced “confounding factors” or bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://medicine.biu.ac.il/en/node/1934">Eyal Sela</a>, director of the Otolaryngology Head &amp; Neck Surgery Department at Galilee University in Israel, and the senior author of the article, called the journal’s decision “outrageous.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We did the research during COVID, which put all of us in a position to examine any patient who entered the hospital without any selection,” he told Retraction Watch, maintaining patient selection was unbiased. The research was conducted in Sela’s lab at the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After <a href="https://x.com/PLOSONE/status/1519242110939144192">responding</a> to Meyerowitz-Katz’s posts on X, the journal asked a member of the editorial board and an independent statistical expert to reassess the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz had followed up with the journal in March 2023 and was told by Maddy Ghose, an editor at <em>PLOS One,</em> the journal was still investigating. He said he hasn’t heard anything since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for why the retraction ultimately took three years, “the case was delayed at different points for various reasons,” Knutson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">All but three of the study’s 18 authors disagreed with the retraction. The rest did not respond, the retraction notice states.</p>



<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HYmb6HodJc1RSKjlKDarFqNp38KYLJKw/view?usp=sharing">An email to Retraction Watch</a> signed by three of the authors — Amiel Dror, Michael Edelstein and Orly Yakir, writing “on behalf of the authors” — says the possibility of “measurement and selection bias is there and acknowledged in the paper.” They also noted the patients’ vitamin D values the researchers used weren’t recorded as part of their study; instead, they included patients who both tested positive for COVID-19 and had existing prior levels available in the hospital database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amieldror/?originalSubdomain=ca">Dror</a> — the study’s corresponding author — and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Orly-Yakir-2135798680">Yakir</a> are researchers at Galilee University, and <a href="https://medicine.biu.ac.il/en/Edelstein#:~:text=Prof.,Michael%20Edelstein&amp;text=Professor%20Michael%20Edelstein%20is%20a,infectious%20disease%20and%20vaccine%20epidemiology.">Edelstein</a> is a professor of public health and epidemiology at Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because of these limitations we were very cautious regarding claims of causation, and we also explicitly state that our findings should not be interpreted as evidence for using vitamin D therapeutically for COVID patients,” the authors told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice also mentions a delay in measurement of vitamin D and COVID-19 infection — anywhere from 14 to 730 days — which the authors said is “relatively short compared to other papers using a similar approach” but was mentioned in the study limitations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also pointed out what they considered errors in the retraction notice, including the statement “the analyses performed were inadequate to test the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels at the time of infection and severity of COVID-19 illness.” The authors told us in their email the “association tested is NOT about levels at the time of infection (since the acute infective process affects vit D levels) but PRE-infection- this is even in the title.”</p>



<p>The researchers continued their “offer to conduct additional analyses to check for the extent of were rejected as coming too late” and the retraction came &#8220;without a warning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We think our results have been a useful addition to the literature, especially in the context of the acute phase of a pandemic,” the authors wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz told us the reasons cited in the retraction notice “make little sense” to him as well and “are very straightforward limitations to the methodology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And yet, the journal has now retracted the paper for reasons that were immediately obvious on a quick perusal of the manuscript, three years too late,” he continued.</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz has <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/this-questionable-study-caught-fire-in-anti-vaccine-circles-how-did-it-get-through-peer-review">flagged</a> several papers from the COVID-19 literature, including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y">attempting</a> to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58170809">debunk</a> the controversial drug ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">By our count</a>, nearly 600 COVID-19 studies have been retracted so far, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/30/research-integrity-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-book-excerpt/">bringing into question</a> how robust the publishing process was in the midst of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Correcting COVID-19 literature has been largely <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001572">slow and laborious</a>. A <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/article/abs/retractions-of-covid19related-research-publications-during-and-after-the-pandemic/DB251754B6349E7E928CE71CD022A396">study published in April</a> in the<em> Cambridge University Press, </em>coauthored by Ferric Fang, who is on the board of <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/">The Center for Scientific Integrity</a>, of our parent nonprofit organization, noted more than half of COVID-19 retractions “resulted from problems that could have been detected prior to publication.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scholarly publishing in mathematics is unlike many other fields, marked by fewer papers, fewer coauthors per paper and fewer citations. But that doesn’t mean the field is immune to fraud and cheating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A pair of papers posted to the arXiv addresses the issue of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07257">fraudulent publishing in math</a>, particularly metrics gaming, and offers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09877">a list of recommendations</a> to help detect and deal with that problem and other fraudulent activities. (The former <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202509/noti3217/noti3217.html?adat=October%202025&amp;trk=3217&amp;pdfissue=202509&amp;pdffile=rnoti-p1038.pdf&amp;cat=none&amp;type=.html">was also published</a> in the October <em>AMS Notices</em>; the latter will appear in the November issue.) “Fraudulent publishing undermines trust in science and scientific results and therefore fuels antiscience movements,” mathematician <a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~agricola/">Ilka Agricola</a>, lead author of both papers, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A professor of mathematics at Marburg University in Germany, Agricola was president of the German Mathematical Society in 2021-2022 and is chair of the Committee on Publishing of the International Mathematical Union. The new articles are the products of a working group of the IMU and the International Council of Industrial and Applied Mathematics.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132920"></span>



<p>Agricola spoke with us about the reports and about fraud in mathematics. Questions and responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>:&nbsp; Few people talk about fraudulent publishing in math. Why is that?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: For a long time, mathematicians thought that as long as they keep away from predatory journals or paper mills, the problem does not affect them. This turned out to be wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: If you look at the number of papers that tripped Clear Skies’ Papermill Alarm in 2022 (we included a histogram in <a href="https://theconversation.com/fake-papers-are-contaminating-the-worlds-scientific-literature-fueling-a-corrupt-industry-and-slowing-legitimate-lifesaving-medical-research-246224">this article</a> we wrote for <em>The Conversation</em>), math is pretty far down the list. Are there a lot of fake papers in math?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: It is probably fair to say that the problem is not as severe as in other fields like cancer research, but the community is smaller and the number of fake papers is growing at alarming speed. Predatory and low-quality mega-journals are trying hard to lure respected scientists into their parallel universe of fake science, thus trying to give themselves the impression of respectability. Thus, one of our goals is to raise awareness for the issue in the mathematical community!</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: As you note in the new papers, Clarivate announced in 2023 it had excluded the entire field of math from its list of “Highly Cited Researchers,” or HCRs. What’s going on?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: The publication culture in math differs a bit from, say, experimental and life sciences. On average, mathematicians publish fewer papers with fewer authors than scientists in other fields. So, with the same absolute number of papers and citations, one can become a “highly-cited researcher” in math, but not in other fields. Thus, gaming the system is easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The list of HCRs for mathematics became so screwed that Clarivate couldn’t pretend anymore that it had any value. This being said, Clarivate announced that they would look into new measuring tools, but didn’t come up with any alternative ideas in the meantime, nor did they contact any representatives of the international mathematical community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: You note in your paper that the institution with the highest number of highly cited researchers in 2019 was China Medical University in Taiwan, which does not have a program in mathematics. How is that possible?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: Good question! Admission to the “Hall of Fame” of HCRs has a decisive advantage for the university of a scholar: It impacts their rank in the “<a href="https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/arwu/2025">Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>” [ARWU, published since 2003], also nicknamed the “Shanghai ranking.” So, the institution benefits even if it does not have a math program. Of course, we agree that a topic not taught at a place ought not to be included, but that’s how the system works. Clarivate is treating its HCRs in a very kind way: They ask them about their affiliation. So, at the moment of making the count, researchers just give China Medical University (or any other institution) as their affiliation, despite not being there. The researchers typically get a contract as a “visiting professor” to hide that, in the end, they are being dishonest about their affiliation, and of course, being an HCR may give them more benefits, prestige, and grant access at their home institution as well. I was certainly surprised to learn that there is a lot of cheating with affiliations going on! Actually, many institutions do not have clear rules for primary and secondary affiliations.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: If a clinical trial is fake, that’s a problem that can obviously affect life-and-death decisions. Do bogus papers and other types of publishing fraud in math have real-world consequences, too?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: Mathematics has many famous open conjectures. Predatory journals can give people the opportunity to publish “proofs” of these without credible peer review. The status of these results can become unclear, and further research based on them will then be a waste of effort or resources. On a larger scale, many junk papers are claiming to deal with applications, so it could create the wrong impression that these results solve concrete problems, and actually don’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: You and your coauthors are mathematicians, and yet you argue against focusing on numbers like journal impact factors and publication and citation counts. Is that what’s driving all of this bad behavior?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” This quote is from the British economist Charles Goodhart, and it also applies to bibliometrics measures. Of course, gaming these metrics has always existed, but some of us liked to believe that they would be roughly OK, with some error bar due to some cheating. Now, we realize the error bar is larger than the number one wants to measure. Perhaps one advantage of mathematicians is that they are not easily impressed by numbers, and we have the means to understand and analyze them — this is our job. And so, the conclusion is very clear: The correlation between bibliometrics and research quality is so low that we should not use bibliometrics. And I urge all colleagues to say so openly!</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: So how do we judge research quality if we shouldn&#8217;t use publication metrics?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: Read the actual publications instead of relying on bibliometrics! Plus, in mathematics, we are lucky to have two extremely well curated databases for math papers and journals, <a href="https://zbmath.org/">zbMath Open</a> and <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/publications-search">MathReviews</a>. If a journal is not included there, it’s either very interdisciplinary or one should get suspicious.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch</strong>: Is it possible for individual researchers to jump off the bibiometrics bandwagon without jeopardizing their careers?</p>



<p><strong>Agricola</strong>: We need to fight for a change in culture, that’s for sure, and the path will be rash and hard. To young researchers, we should give the warning that being involved in predatory publishing can also just as well put their scientific integrity at risk. Remember the people who had to resign because of data falsification?&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the situation is not hopeless. Some effective changes would be easy to implement:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Define good publishing practices, encourage people to follow them, educate the young generation about predatory publishing.</li>



<li>Discourage the use of bibliometrics in hiring and promotion committees or for graduating.</li>



<li>Evaluate faculty by their best papers and ‘activeness’ without pressure to publish too frequently.</li>



<li>Do not publish in journals charging article processing charges&nbsp; — most serious math journals don’t do it.</li>



<li>Check the quality of journals before joining their editorial board.</li>



<li>Choose the journals or special issues in which you publish and the journals for which you write reviews wisely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy fixes for complex health problems can be tempting — but they rarely pan out. That seems to be the case for the investigators on one clinical trial who claimed consuming apple cider vinegar caused obese teens and young adults to lose weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2023-000823">article</a> appeared in March 2024 in <em>BMJ Nutrition, Prevention &amp; Health</em>. The journal is retracting the paper &#8220;because the authors’ analyses could not be replicated and multiple errors were identified,” according to the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2023-000823ret">retraction notice</a>.</p>



<p>The retraction, dated September 23, comes more than a year after sleuths pointed out some of these errors and other problems with the analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132917"></span>



<p>The paper <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/drinking-1-tablespoon-of-apple-cider-vinegar-daily-linked-to-weight-loss">was</a> <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/apple-cider-vinegar-may-help-with-weight-management">covered</a> <a href="https://www.health.com/study-daily-apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss-8619969">widely</a> when it was published, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/well/eat/apple-cider-vinegar-benefits.html?smid=url-share">some outlets</a> gave context for the unreliability of this type of research when they mentioned it. It has been cited three times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study found that overweight and obese people who consumed apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks lost an average of 6 to 8 kilograms and their BMI dropped by an average of 2.7 to 3.0 points.</p>



<p>If the claims were true, apple cider vinegar would be 50 percent more effective than GLP-1 agonists such as Ozempic, said James Heathers, a research integrity consultant and director of the Medical Evidence Project (an initiative of The Center for Scientific Integrity, the parent nonprofit of Retraction Watch).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rony Abou-Khalil, corresponding author on both the paper and the response, did not respond to our requests for comment. He is listed as the <a href="https://www.usek.edu.lb/en/about-usek/faculty-affairs/directory/rony-abou-khalil">head of the department of biology</a> at Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, in Lebanon.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Heathers started looking into the paper shortly after it was published, and published <a href="https://www.researchhub.com/post/2220/apple-cider-vinegar-for-weight-management">an analysis</a> describing flaws in the study in May 2024. He described the nearly identical age and BMI distributions within each 30-person experimental group as “unlikely.” </p>



<p>Although researchers want each group to have similar characteristics, randomly assigning participants would usually result in more variation between the groups than seen in the study. The age, height and weight are “almost identical between the randomized [groups of] participants,” he wrote. “This extreme uniformity likely represents a failure of randomization, although it is unclear how this arose.”</p>



<p>He went on to describe other flaws with the statistical analysis in the paper, and pointed out the authors didn’t include their original dataset with the publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After reading Heathers’ assessment, Vahid Malbouby at Boise State University and Eric Trexler at Duke University wrote to him citing additional problems with the paper. For example, other studies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-020-02214-3">do not support the claim</a> that apple cider vinegar raises basal metabolic rate even at higher doses than used in the study. The three wrote a letter to the journal detailing their concerns, which they submitted in June 2024 and the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2024-000997">published in February</a> of this year.</p>



<p>Five rapid responses posted on the article in September and October 2024 questioned the statistical analysis conducted in the paper, as well as problems with the study’s design. One such concern is that each experimental group included participants ages 12 to 25 years. This large range of ages including both children and adults could confound the results, “in that BMI and weight change is very different in a 12 year old who is still likely to be growing and a 25 year old,” according to a response authored by Duane D. Mellor, a dietitian at Aston University in England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mellor also pointed out “there is no statement of trial registration, no CONSORT flowchart and now [sic] CONSORT checklist.“ Many publishers, including BMJ, require authors to provide these documents before publishing the research to ensure the validity and transparency of the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2024, the journal published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2024-001102">a letter</a> from two of the paper’s original three authors. The authors cited papers to justify their original statistical analysis, the biological plausibility of such a large effect, and the unusual data distributions. They concluded, “we assert that the methodologies employed in our study were appropriate and supported by existing literature.”</p>



<p>Given how long ago serious flaws were identified, “it is disappointing that an expression of concern had not been posted to the article,” said Andrew W. Brown, an associate professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and director of biostatistics for the Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, who studies pediatrics, nutrition and obesity. “That left a window of time when a reader may have been misled by the work while it was being evaluated.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In addition to the paper’s analyses not being replicable, the retraction notice identifies other issues as well: “The authors supplied dataset also demonstrated patterns inconsistent with random allocation of participants to treatment groups, improbably small p-values given the limited number of participants included in the study.”</p>



<p>According to the notice, “the authors state that the discrepancies were honest mistakes that arose from version mismatches, data rounding or formatting differences when exporting from statistical software to reporting spreadsheets. However, the authors agree with the decision to retract the work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1099052">statement</a>, Helen Macdonald, publication ethics and content integrity editor at BMJ Group, said: “While we deal with allegations as swiftly as possible, it’s very important that due process is followed. Investigations are often complex. This one involved detailed scrutiny of data and correspondence with researchers, institutions, and other experts, for example. Reaching a sound and fair and final decision can therefore take several months.”</p>



<p>Regarding the fact that the journal published the study without clinical trial registration, Martin Kohlmeier, editor-in-chief of <em>BMJ Nutrition Prevention &amp; Health,</em> said in the same statement, “In hindsight, this was the wrong decision to make. But the authors come from a scientific environment that is underrepresented in nutritional research and the journal aims to prioritise high quality evidence, which usually comes from clinical trials.”</p>



<p>Flawed clinical trials are not uncommon in the field of nutrition, Brown told us. “I am glad to see the retraction of this paper to uphold the integrity of the field, but we need to do better in the field of nutrition to register, design, conduct, and report trials to a high standard before publication,” he said.</p>
