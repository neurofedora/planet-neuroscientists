<p>On paper, data scientist Gunasekaran Manogaran has had a stellar scientific career. He earned an award as a young researcher from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and landed a series of postdoctoral and visiting researcher positions at universities in the U.S, including the University of California, Davis; Gannon University in Pennsylvania; and Howard University in Washington, D.C. His h-index — a measure of a researcher’s impact and productivity — is 60, a number that by one&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283832/">model</a>&nbsp;would mark him as “truly unique” if achieved within 20 years. He did it in fewer than 10.</p>



<p>Emails obtained by Undark<em>,&nbsp;</em>however, suggest some researchers have doubts about his publishing record. The correspondence includes an initial message from someone claiming to have previously worked with Manogaran. It was sent to some 40 editors of scientific journals, many owned by major scientific publishers: Elsevier, Springer Nature<em>,&nbsp;</em>Wiley<em>,&nbsp;</em>and Taylor &amp; Francis among them.</p>



<p>The sender alleges that Manogaran and others run a research paper publishing scam — one that both generates revenues and artificially burnishes the scientific bona fides of individual and institutional participants. In particular, the alleged scheme targets what are known in the scientific publishing industry as “special issues” — self-contained special editions that are not part of a journal’s regular publishing schedule, typically focused on a single topic or theme.</p>



<p>The email, dated April 12, 2022, informs the journal editors that they may have partnered with members of this alleged scheme and urges them to take action. “If you don’t do that there would be a next group doing the same scam in name of different persons,” the email states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parachute-paleontology-science-colonialism-fossils">Paleontology has a ‘parachute science’ problem. Here’s how it plays out in 3 nations</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the Cretaceous Period, roughly 100 million years ago, the dinosaur <em>Ubirajara jubatus</em> probably turned heads with its feathers, shoulder rods and flashy displays. In 2020, the petite theropod made headlines as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-fuzz-rods-feathers-first-southern-hemisphere">the first feathered dinosaur discovered in the Southern Hemisphere</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/20</em>).</p>



<p>Today, the dinosaur is notorious for different reasons: Shortly after the news of its discovery, its backstory quickly drew some red flags.</p>



<p>The fossil had been unearthed in Brazil’s Araripe Basin, yet no Brazilian researchers were involved in its study. The researchers initially said they found the fossil in a Brazilian museum and brought it to a German museum in 1995 for further study, yet that museum later revealed it bought the fossil in 2009 from a private company. That company imported the fossil to Germany in 2006, yet it’s not clear if that import was legal.</p>





<p><em>U. jubatus</em> isn’t unique in this sense. A supposed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/museum-fossil-links-snakes-lizards">four-legged, 120-million-year-old snake (<em>Tetrapodophis amplectus</em></a>), for example, also made an unsanctioned trip from Brazil to Germany (<em>SN: 7/23/15</em>). And then there’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-shark-fossil-weird-fins-manta-ray-underwater-flight"> a roughly 90-million-year-old shark (<em>Aquilolamna milarcae</em>) from Mexico with a fantastic wingspan</a>, which may have been purchased by a private collector through a legal loophole<em> &nbsp;</em>(<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>These and many other cases of fossil fishiness are part of a long trend of what some call “parachute science” (or in this case “parachute paleontology”) and “scientific colonialism.” </p>



<p>These umbrella terms describe practices where scientists from high-income countries travel to middle- and low-income countries to study or collect fossils and fail to collaborate with or involve local experts. Or they skirt local laws around fossil collection and export. Sometimes the fossils are removed from their home countries under dubious or outright illegal circumstances. In other cases, the scientists purchase fossils from dealers, smugglers or private collectors in their own countries. The trend is linked to the legacy of colonialism, as many of the lower-income countries also happen to be former European colonies, while the higher-income ones are former colonizers.</p>



<p>“We’re talking about 21st century science here … so it shouldn’t be happening. It’s just too much,” says Juan Carlos Cisneros, a paleontologist at Universidade Federal do Piauí in Teresina, Brazil.</p>



<p>When researchers ignore local expertise, obtain fossils illegally or just buy specimens outright, it encourages corruption in communities near fossil beds, discourages early-career scientists from pursuing their profession and can result in unethical or poor-quality research. Illegally traded fossils not only violate the laws of their home countries, but they might also be separated from their geological context or modified by collectors.</p>



<p>To some degree, these practices were long seen as part of <a href="https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/pdfs/commentary_benefit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how paleontology and geology work</a>, says Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany. “I’ve heard it described as a conquest culture, where the Earth is there to be explored and exploited to further advance our understanding of the history of Earth,” she says. While other fields have raised their standards for field research, Dunne and others see paleontology as behind the times.</p>



<p>To understand the extent of parachute paleontology, Dunne and her colleagues compiled a database that tracked where the authors of more than 26,000 fossil publications were based. The team found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01608-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">97 percent of these papers came from researchers based in high- and upper-middle-income countries</a>. The United States, Germany and the United Kingdom top the list of countries with the most publications on foreign fossils, the researchers reported in the February 2022 <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>. Some countries’ fossil deposits were also being studied more than others, either because those countries had more funds to do their own research or because foreign researchers wanted to travel there, says coauthor Nussaïbah Raja, a paleobiologist also at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biggest publishers</h3>



<p>The authors of most papers on fossils are from North America and Europe, researchers reported in 2022. The United States leads, with similar amounts of foreign and domestic research. The next three countries — Germany, the United Kingdom and France — all conduct more research abroad than they do domestically. The analysis was based on more than 26,000 publications from <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Paleobiology Database</a> that have author affiliations. The catalog has caveats, however: Submissions are voluntary, which makes it an incomplete picture of the field.</p>

<p>Based on ratios of publications that include local authors and those that don’t, the team developed an index for countries most at risk for parachute paleontology. Those countries include places like the Dominican Republic, Myanmar and Namibia, the team reported in the same study<em>.</em> But the problem is widespread, they found.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">At risk</h3>



<p>To measure how parachute paleontology impacts countries, paleobiologist Nussaïbah Raja and colleagues created an index number, based on the ratio of the number of domestic to foreign authors on papers about fossils from those countries. The Dominican Republic and Myanmar, which top the list, are both hot spots for fossils preserved in amber, which have become highly commercialized.</p>

<p>“As soon as you give people cold, hard numbers, they suddenly just turn around and listen. And that was our whole aim,” Dunne says. Researchers used similar methods to dig into how those numbers play out in three countries: Brazil, Mexico and Myanmar. Each country acts as a case study showing a spectrum of the different ways parachute paleontology hurts communities where fossils are found.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Brazil</h4>



<p>Brazil passed a law in 1942 that defines fossils as property of the federal government and another law in 1990 that regulates foreign research efforts within the country. The country allows exporting but requires a permit and a partnership with a Brazilian science institution. Commercial trading of fossils within the country is prohibited.</p>



<p>Yet an analysis of papers from 1990 to 2020 on Cretaceous vertebrate and plant fossils discovered in the Araripe Basin showed that over half of those 72 publications described <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fossils that ended up in a different country</a>. And of the nearly 60 percent of papers on exported fossils, none mention export permits, Cisneros and colleagues reported in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em> in 2022. While one included details about fieldwork performed by the authors, details on collection permits were lacking.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exported heritage</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-6">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow">
<p>Since Brazil does not allow fossil exports without permission, paleontologist Juan Carlos Cisneros and colleagues looked at where some of the country’s fossils are housed. They analyzed 72 papers from 1990 to 2020. Each paper described the fossils of a new Cretaceous vertebrate or plant species found in Araripe Basin. The researchers limited their analysis to publications on holotypes, go-to specimens that represent a species, because of the sheer volume of publications on this basin and the importance of those types of fossils to paleontology. The majority of these holotypes are no longer in Brazil, the team found, making it much harder for Brazilian researchers to access them. To study a fossil at a museum in Germany, Cisneros says, “I will be asked for a visa, I will need to spend money in a currency that is six times more expensive than my own.”</p>

<p>Over half of all the publications described fossils that were probably bought, and many did not include local authors. Less than half of the publications were led by Brazilian researchers. Notably, those that were led by local scientists contained fewer issues, such as missing permit information or references to purchasing fossils.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Parachute problems</h3>



<p>Brazil also regulates fossil excavations and what happens to specimens after they’re excavated. In their analysis of 72 papers on Cretaceous fossils from Araripe Basin, Cisneros and colleagues looked at the prevalence of different issues linked to parachute paleontology. These issues included whether the study mentions permits to excavate or export the fossil and any evidence that fossils may have been purchased (despite the sale of fossils being illegal in Brazil). The team also looked at whether local paleontologists were involved in or led the work. The most prevalent issues in Brazil appear to be the export of fossils without permission and the purchase of fossils despite local regulations.</p>

<p>The infamous <em>T. amplectus</em> exemplifies many of these trends. Originally <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa9208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a four-legged snake</a>, the fossil was discovered in Brazil and subsequently made its way to Germany without the involvement of Brazilian researchers. The original research team claimed that the fossil was permanently housed in a museum, when in fact it belonged to a private collector, and the researchers could not produce evidence that the specimen had been exported legally. To top it off, a team that included a Brazilian scientist later <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14772019.2021.1983044?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;role=tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disputed the claim</a> that the ancient critter was even a snake.</p>

<p>To date, the original paper has not been retracted and the fossil remains in Germany. After the specimen was reportedly damaged in a CT scan, the private collector temporarily <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-fossil-of-a-snake-like-lizard-has-generated-controversy-beyond-its-identity-171568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoked access to researchers</a>, and now paleontologists <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/update-controversial-four-legged-snake-may-be-ancient-lizard-instead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can study</a> the specimen only at the private museum where it’s currently on loan.</p>



<p>“Overall, these [issues] have an effect of making younger generations become less interested in science,” Cisneros says. “Students become frustrated, because they see that foreigners are basically doing their research.” In Brazil, fossils are considered part of the national heritage. When fossils are housed in other countries, he says, it becomes incredibly difficult for local researchers to study their own heritage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mexico</h4>



<p>As in Brazil, fossils are considered property of the federal government in Mexico and cannot be exported permanently without permission or commercially traded. The country also has guidelines for foreign researchers that include working with local scientists.</p>



<p>And yet, many of the issues found with Brazilian fossils <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cropped up here as well</a>, Cisneros, Dunne and colleagues reported in the same 2022 study.</p>



<p>The team focused on 126 publications from 1990 to 2021 on Jurassic and Cretaceous fossils of vertebrates, invertebrates and other species from sites in the Sabinas, La Popa and Parras basins. Nearly half of these studies were not led by Mexico-based researchers. And most were missing information on collection permits, whether they were headed by local or foreign scientists.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common problems</h3>



<p>In their analysis of 126 papers on fossils from select sites in Mexico, Juan Carlos Cisneros and colleagues looked at the same set of publication issues as they did with papers on fossils from Brazil. In Mexico, paleontology appears to have benefitted from a long history of regulation and enforcement around archaeological artifacts, with generally fewer issues across the board. The country still struggles with specimens ending up in private collections and an absence of collection permit information among work led by both local and foreign scientists.</p>

<p>Unlike in Brazil, most of the fossil specimens in the study range stayed in Mexico. The country’s success in preventing fossil smuggling could simply come down to stricter enforcement, Cisneros says, and a long history of regulation in paleontology’s sister field, archaeology.</p>



<p>Interestingly, compared with Brazilian fossils, a slightly higher fraction of fossils from Mexico ended up in private collections, which present their own access challenges. “In private collections, you depend [on] the goodwill of some millionaire,” Cisneros says. When fossils are sold to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sale-t-rex-fossil-big-loss-science-dinosaur">private owners like millionaires</a> or <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/nicolas-cage-and-leonardo-dicaprio-owned-dinosaur-skulls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollywood celebrities</a>, scientists lose access, and thus, the ability to study the specimens (<em>SN: 12/2/22</em>).</p>

<p>For fossils from Mexico, Cisneros and colleagues analyzed 126 papers from 1990 to 2021. Each paper described one or more Jurassic or Cretaceous fossils of a vertebrate or invertebrate organism — or nontraditional fossil specimens such as dinosaur tracks or petrified wood — from one of three basins. Compared to Brazil, Mexico appears to have a much better record on illicit fossil export, the team found. Most of the fossils from the publication dataset remain in Mexico. Just one paper describes fossils that were collected in the 1930s and exported to the United States.</p>

<p>The long-finned fossil shark described in 2021 came under scrutiny when researchers initially claimed it was housed in a museum that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-01-19/mexican-millionaire-builds-controversial-replica-of-mansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hadn’t been built yet</a>; it <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ancient-shark-fossil-exquisite-some-researchers-wonder-if-they-ll-be-able-study-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was actually in a collector’s stash</a>. They later updated the paper to say that the shark <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would temporarily be housed</a> in a different museum. The collector also told <em>Science</em> that the rock that contained the fossil had been purchased, not the fossil itself, and that the sale was thus legal.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, these fossils would be studied and stored in museums near where they are discovered. “If they go to the to the local museums, they will improve the local economy, the social conditions of the community,” Cisneros says. But even within Mexico, that’s not the case. Many fossils are housed in museums in big cities far from the rock formations where they existed for millions of years.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Myanmar</h4>



<p>Myanmar has always been renowned as a source of fossilized insects, plants and reptiles preserved in amber. But in recent years, the country has experienced an extreme case of colonialism in paleontology.</p>



<p>The volume of Myanmar amber publications over the past several decades experienced <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03847-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge spike beginning in 2014</a> that appears to correlate with political shifts in the country, Dunne and colleagues reported in September 2022 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. “It just suddenly explodes,” she says. “And that&#8217;s eye-catching. It gives you a sense that something else is fueling it, rather than just research interest.”</p>



<p>Amber exports exist in a legal gray area because amber is classified as a gemstone, which can be exported legally while fossils cannot. News reports suggest that scientists who study Myanmar amber might buy it across the border in Chinese markets, from dealers or from internet websites. And there are concerns about where the money from those sales ends up.</p>



<p>In 2010, the Myanmar military began taking over the country’s gemstone mines, where amber deposits are often discovered. By 2017, it had complete control. Over the decade or so since, publications on amber fossils started piling up, as have reports of the Myanmar military’s human rights violations and conflicts with ethnic militias. Then in 2021, military leaders staged a political coup and overthrew the government.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conflict fossils</h3>



<p>Around 2014, the worldwide number of papers on fossils preserved in Myanmar amber began to spike, paleobiologist Emma Dunne and colleagues reported in 2022. The timing coincides with some gemstone markets opening near the Chinese border with Myanmar. The trend also tracks with the military’s gradual takeover of gemstone mines beginning in 2010. The increase in paleontologists accessing Myanmar amber through those markets was probably very gradual at first, Raja says. It could have been as simple as “a paleontologist, by coincidence, sees something that&#8217;s really cool, and then [they] tell their paleontologist friends, and then more and more people start going to these markets to find more [amber specimens].” The team opted to look at three-year rolling averages of publications to account for the fact that peer review and publishing takes time.</p>

<p>Both the military and ethnic militias have used these mining operations to fund their operations, and ethical questions about researchers acquiring Myanmar amber specimens began to mount even before the coup. While there’s no paper trail to connect the Myanmar military or militias to amber fossils described in journals, the study rings alarm bells that paleontologists who purchase fossils might be inadvertently helping fund a military coup and human rights violations. “Even if it&#8217;s the tiniest little impact that you&#8217;re making, why make it at all?” Dunne asks.</p>



<p>The authors on Myanmar amber studies published during that spike from 2014 to 2021 were predominantly based outside the country. Even over a broader period from 1990 to 2021, just five out of 872 publications on Myanmar amber included researchers from Myanmar. Over the same period, publications on fossils from Myanmar that were not preserved in amber did not see the same disparity.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Local collaboration</h3>



<p>Paleobiologist Emma Dunne and colleagues looked at who was publishing papers on both amber and nonamber fossils from Myanmar after amber publications began to spike in 2014. While local authors were rarely involved in work on amber fossils, they were much more involved in work on nonamber fossils, often primate species. Foreign collaboration with local researchers tends to be more common on nonamber fossil work because those studies often involve fieldwork in remote areas and access to local museum collections. Political conditions in Myanmar have made foreign travel to the country more difficult, so local collaborators make that research possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reversing these research trends <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01472-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have positive ripple effects in Myanmar</a>, two of the study’s coauthors, Myanmarese geologists Zin-Maung-Maung-Thein of the University of Mandalay and Khin Zaw of the University of Tasmania in Australia, wrote in a letter to <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em> in 2021. By working with scientists within Myanmar, “not only will scientific research standards improve within the country, but Myanmar’s people will gain a better understanding of the importance and scientific value of their own natural heritage rather than being robbed of it.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next?</h4>



<p><em>U. jubatus </em>— the flamboyant theropod — might get a happy ending. The journal <em>Cretaceous Research</em> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195667120303736?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrew</a> the discovery paper. And after an investigation and public outcry, Germany <a href="https://bnn.de/karlsruhe/karlsruhe-stadt/innenstadt/naturkundemuseum-muss-dino-fossil-an-brasilien-zurueckgeben-ubirajara-jubatus-ministerium-rio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed in July 2022 to return the fossil to Brazil</a>. The fossil <a href="https://www.gov.br/mcti/pt-br/acompanhe-o-mcti/noticias/2023/06/apos-retorno-ao-brasil-fossil-ubirajara-jubatus-e-levado-para-o-ministerio-da-ciencia-tecnologia-e-inovacao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally returned home</a> in June, and <em>U. jubatus </em>will ultimately become part of collections at the Museu de Paleontologia Plácido Cidade Nuvens near where it was first excavated in Ceará, Brazil. “It symbolizes a new phase in the way of doing science with respect for national laws and the rights of societies,&#8221; the museum&#8217;s director Allyson Pinheiro said in a statement. </p>



<p>The field itself hasn’t changed overnight and still has work to do to achieve lasting change. The pressure to publish papers that make splashy headlines, which drives some of this bad behavior, as Dunne notes, isn’t going away.</p>



<p>Many of the same names and foreign institutions keep cropping up in the analyses. In some cases, by purchasing a fossil or failing to get permission from local governments to excavate, those individuals appear to have broken local laws. “Some groups of researchers have always been notorious for conducting parachute science in the most unethical ways. And they just get a free pass by the community,” Dunne laments.</p>

Cisneros <em>et al</em>/<em>Royal Society Open Science</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Combating the issue will require work on all fronts, Dunne and Cisneros agree: Journals must raise the bar on the information they require on a fossil’s origin and chain of custody; funders need to require that their grant recipients work with local experts and follow the laws of the country where the fieldwork is taking place; governments have to enforce those laws; and foreign researchers should collaborate with and credit their local counterparts.</p>



<p>In response to the recent data, social media campaigns and wider public awareness, some journals have changed their policies to require evidence of a fossil’s origins or necessary permits, but changes have been sporadic. <em>Cretaceous Research</em> previously declared it would not publish studies of fossils with unclear provenance, yet articles about Myanmar amber deposits still appear in that journal. The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology took a strong stance on Myanmar amber, initially issuing a moratorium on publications based on specimens collected after 2017 and later amending it to amber acquired after the coup in 2021, with guidelines for how to handle specimens collected before then. But vertebrates are only one slice of the fossil record, and many amber fossils preserve insects and plants.</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01479-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-out moratoriums</a>. Some paleontologists have argued that laws aimed at protecting fossils suppress science by <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/November-2011/Protect-and-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limiting the number of fossils that are excavated</a> and <a href="https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/publications/why-palaeontologists-must-break-the-law-a-polemic-from-an-apologi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discourage amateur fossil collecting</a>. “If you are in a country that bans fossil collecting and you find a really nice ichthyosaur jaw lying on the beach … are you going to leave it there for the tide to wash it away? The hell you are,” David Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth in England and a coauthor on the <em>U. jubatus </em>paper, <a href="https://www.geocurator.org/images/resources/geocurator/vol10/geocurator_10_10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in <em>The Geological Curator</em> in 2018</a>. </p>



<p>Legal commercialization of fossils in some countries complicates the issue. Raja recalls recently walking into a main street shop in a German city and seeing Moroccan sharks and a Mongolian dinosaur egg for sale just a few doors down from big brands like H&amp;M. While a dealer might have some documentation on the fossil’s legality, it’s hard to say for sure. “It’s really widespread in some countries,” Raja says. “I can go to a shop in Germany and just buy a fossil.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/decode-arecibo-alien-message-math">Here’s how we could begin decoding an alien message using math</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the most famous messages ever beamed to space was a string of 1,679 bits sent by the Arecibo radio telescope in 1974. But if E.T. sent us such a string, how could we Earthlings even begin to decode it? A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new mathematical approach</a> proposes a way.</p>



<p>For anyone trying to interpret the Arecibo message — a drawing depicting a person, the DNA double helix, the solar system and the telescope itself, among other information — they’d first have to understand that it was an image at all, and that the image was 23 pixels wide and 73 pixels tall. </p>

<p>As it sent the signal, the radio antenna encoded the 1,679 bits by flipping between two different frequencies, representing one and zero respectively. If you line the bits up differently — placing more or fewer than 23 pixels per row — the image looks like a random mess.</p>



<p>We’d face a similar challenge if aliens sent us a message. How would we know the number and size of its dimensions?</p>





<p>The Arecibo scientists built a clue into the transmission: 23 and 73 are prime numbers — a scheme other intelligent life might recognize, if they too find primes to be interesting. But alien messages could come in many forms and have many dimensions, says Brian McConnell, a computer scientist at Notion Labs in San Francisco, and author of <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-74845-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alien Communication Handbook</a></em>. A message might be a database in which each element is not just a value but a list of values, or a list of lists. A message in the form of a physics simulation could include a series of measures for each point in spacetime.</p>



<p>The new decoding method, developed by Hector Zenil, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge and the founder of Oxford Immune Algorithmics, and colleagues, takes a string of bits — an incoming message — and looks at every possible combination of dimension number and size. 100 bits, for example, might be 1&#215;100 or 10&#215;10 (two dimensions) or 4x5x5 (three dimensions) or 2x2x5x5 (four dimensions) and so on.</p>



<p>It then looks at each possible configuration’s orderliness in two ways. To get a measure of local order, it breaks the message into patches. For each patch, it searches a catalog of trillions of tiny computer programs the researchers had previously created to explore algorithmic space, and counts how many programs generate an identical patch. (The programs’ outputs were precomputed and saved, making searches fast.) The more programs that create an identical patch, the higher the patch’s score for local order. The patch scores are averaged to get an overall local order score for the entire configuration. The researchers also measure each possible configuration’s global order by seeing how much an image compression algorithm can shrink it without losing information — mathematically, randomness is less compressible than regular patterns. By combining the local and global scores, the researchers have a sense of how likely each configuration is to be the correct one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="213" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2.jpg" alt="An image of a black background with a rainbow of different colors scattered across the frame." class="wp-image-3125373" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_mh_alien-messages_inline2-330x103.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3125373">Arranging the string of Arecibo bits into an image 73 pixels wide by 23 pixels tall would scramble the intended visuals (color added). But a mathematical approach could still reveal the message.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125373">Jarmo Kivekas/Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team tested the method on a version of the Arecibo message that had been expanded to six times its size, so the width was now 138 pixels. In one analysis, the researchers arranged the sequence of bits into images ranging from 0 to 200 pixels across, a subset of possible configurations. Graphing image width on the x axis and the likelihood score on the y axis for each configuration, there were a few sharp spikes, the most prominent at 138. The method showed similar success when parsing other messages encoded as bits, including several other images, an audio file and a 3-D MRI scan.</p>



<p>The new approach could also handle the kind of noise that might be introduced as a message travels through space. In another analysis, the original Arecibo message’s width of 23 pixels stood out even when a quarter of the bits had been flipped from 1 to 0 or vice versa.</p>



<p>“This paper is quite exciting, because what we have shown is that if you have a piece of information that is not completely random, then it actually encodes the original space in which it was intended,” Zenil says. In other words, the message tells you its own geometry.&nbsp;He notes that in Carl Sagan’s sci-fi novel <em>Contact</em>, and the movie based on it, the characters spend a lot of time figuring out that a message received from aliens is in three dimensions (specifically a video). “If you have our tools, you would solve that problem in seconds and with no human intervention.”</p>



<p>Even if aliens send a continuous signal rather than bits, he says, the method could help find the right sampling frequency for digitizing it. It would just add more configurations to try.</p>



<p>“What I like about it is that it’s a mathematically rigorous approach to characterizing a transmission,” McConnell says of the technique, which has not yet been peer reviewed. What’s more, “most of the people in the SETI community” — referring to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence — “focus on signal detection. They don’t tend to give a lot of thought to what would come after that.”</p>



<p>SETI researcher Douglas Vakoch, the president of METI International, a nonprofit that studies how we might message extraterrestrial intelligence, notes that the new approach frees prime numbers to serve a secondary purpose in parsing a message. “Instead of being a guide to&nbsp;<em>discover</em>&nbsp;the format, they can now be used to&nbsp;<em>confirm</em>&nbsp;that the decoders found the correct solution,” Vakoch wrote via email.</p>





<p>(“Primes are somehow very special in a mathematical sense,” Zenil notes, “because they can be thought of as a compressed version of the natural numbers.” But there are also other types of interesting numbers to choose from, many listed in the <a href="https://oeis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.)</p>



<p>Of course, even if we could detect and format the message, we’d still need to interpret it correctly. Might a shape indicate an alien body, a spacecraft, an equation or a smudge?</p>



<p>Zenil notes that the approach has potential terrestrial applications, for instance in deciphering intercellular signaling. He’s also already used conceptually similar methods to identify important components in gene regulatory networks — if you perturb one part, does it make the overall system less intelligible? An algorithm that pieces together smaller algorithmic components in order to explain or predict data — this new method is just one way to do it — may also help us one day achieve artificial general intelligence, Zenil says. Such automated approaches don’t depend on human assumptions about the signal. That opens the door to discovering forms of intelligence that might think differently from our own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are actively recruiting a Co-Editor-in-Chief for <em>Complex Systems</em>. Stay tuned for announcements from the journal!<br></p>



<h3><strong>Extending our mission to new communities</strong></h3>



<p>We see <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new journals</a> as an opportunity to give evolving research communities opportunities to forge a new path for research in the field. Whether that means welcoming new ways of sharing research transparently, or cementing new policies that enable research to be evaluated and rewarded more fairly, or simply finding a broader audience where research can make a greater real-world impact.<br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>I&rsquo;m really excited to deepen our work with the research communities and stakeholders who will be a part of these journals. We have worked intentionally with these communities of researchers who have shared a need for venues that do more than help researchers share their work. Our journals will provide a space for experts of different disciplines to come together, to spark important discussions, and to explore and shape Open Science practices that will drive the field forward.</em></p><cite>Rebecca Kirk<br>Publisher, Portfolio Development</cite></blockquote>



<p>Our new journals will encourage open-sharing behaviors that support rigor, reproducibility, and rapid dissemination of research. And we&rsquo;ll hold ourselves accountable for that progress. As with all PLOS journals, we&rsquo;ll offer opportunities for authors to share preprints, improve access to data and transparency of methodologies, and choose to publish their peer reviews. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">Open Science Indicators</a> will allow us to establish benchmarks for open-sharing behaviors in these fields for the first time, and to track changes over time to test whether our solutions are working.</p>



<p>We also very much want researchers to be active partners in shaping how we do this in responsible and inclusive ways that fit the needs of the community. We look forward to engaging with these stakeholders more deeply and working with them in evolving the new titles, as we have across our portfolio.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Enabling equitable opportunities to participate</strong></h3>



<p>A key element of expanding openness for PLOS is in bringing diverse voices together. Inclusivity and equity are core to a strong foundation of Open Science, and we need to hear from all perspectives in order to make science, the process of publishing science, and the solutions science inspires, more robust. <em>PLOS Mental Health</em> and <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em> will strive to represent research from local experts around the world, and from across various disciplines.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re also exploring which of our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-series">APC-alternative models</a> best serve the researchers who will publish in <em>PLOS Mental Health </em>or <em>PLOS Complex Systems</em>. We guarantee each journal will provide a mechanism for institutional support that enables more authors to publish Open Access, regardless of personal funding resources.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h3><strong>How you can get involved</strong></h3>



<p>As we build these journals, we&rsquo;ll be getting to know our new Editors-in-Chief, recruiting Editorial Board members from a diverse range of disciplines, and learning more about how we can best meet the needs of researchers in these communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about the journals, applying to join the Editorial Board, or signing up for news and updates you can learn more by visiting our websites for <a href="https://plos.org/mental-health-research-journal/#EdBoard"><em>PLOS Mental Health</em></a> or <a href="https://plos.org/complex-systems-research-journal/#EdBoard"><em>PLOS Complex Systems</em></a>. </p>

<p>A journal co-published by two scientific societies is retracting nearly 80 papers after an “investigation into peer review fraud.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-electronic-imaging?webSyncID=eb6ce194-2379-30c5-2b52-a0c6e1339127&#038;sessionGUID=bdb0d55a-7e92-b7b9-9973-be69d5b3c006"><em>Journal of Electronic Imaging</em></a> is retracting the articles – all originally published in special sections between 2021 and 2023 – starting this week. The journal is co-published by &#8220;SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics,&#8221; and IS&amp;T, the Society for Imaging Science and Technology.</p>



<span id="more-127328"></span>



<p>According to a <a href="https://spie.org/news/journal-of-electronic-imaging-to-retract-papers?SSO=1">press release</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The publishers found evidence of large-scale manipulation of the peer review process, including fake reviewer accounts, repeating reviewers, and generic reviewer reports throughout different special sections. In addition, many out-of-scope papers were discovered to have been published in these special sections.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A review by external experts also:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>identified many instances of poorly formed experiments, out-of-date references, evidence of AI-generated language, and limited datasets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the release, Gaurav Sharma, vice president of publications at IS&amp;T and former editor in chief of the journal, said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The manipulation and subversion of the JEI peer review process by a handful of bad actors is deplorable, and we will not let them profit from their shameful actions. We will sanction the perpetrators and correct the scholarly record. We have also added new safeguards in our processes to thwart any future attempts at peer review manipulation.</p>

                <p>Note: This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference</a> (fast forward to minute 31 to begin watching). This is the 3rd in a series of four blogs posts on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-takes-people-willing-to-disrupt-the-system-to-move-it-forward/">part two</a>, I highlighted how shifting to Open Science practices can have meaningful and long-lasting impact.</p>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p>In my earlier blogs, I centered the discussion around how overcoming institutional inertia and Open Science practices can be drivers in how we can collectively change the scholarly publishing industry for the better. But a large question remains. Better for whom? We tend to think that the US and the EU are &lsquo;centers of the universe&rsquo; for scientific knowledge.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>You can probably tell where I am going with this. Too much of the discussion about transitioning to Open Science frames these problems in the context of the Global North. There are global challenges in scholarly publishing that must be addressed. That&rsquo;s why PLOS is also focused on supporting new models for global recognition and inclusion.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.inasp.info/">International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications</a> recently released a study to understand the challenges and opportunities that Open Access (OA) presents to low- and middle-income countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While stakeholders believe that they clearly benefit from OA, the picture that emerges is significantly more complicated. There&rsquo;s a clear conflict between a desire to strengthen local platforms that better serve local needs and feeling pulled to &ldquo;play the game&rdquo; in which norms have been set by the Global North. I mentioned a crop scientist in Africa in my first blog. This is exactly the problem she ran headlong into.</p>



<p>As we&rsquo;ve begun to deepen our work with global research communities at PLOS, our approach is centered on listening, learning, and building together. Most critically, we know that our strategy and business models cannot be separated from our drive toward equity.</p>



<p>A rigid approach to Open Science won&rsquo;t foster equitable participation<strong> </strong>from all communities. We need to be malleable, so we&rsquo;ve designed our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new journals</a> so that they:<strong></strong></p>



<p>o&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Represent diverse communities of Open Science practice</p>



<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Have inclusive publishing criteria and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">editorial policies</a></p>



<p>o<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/open-for-submissions-part-2-models/">Share costs more equitably</a> and factor in countries ability to pay</p>



<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a couple of examples.</p>



<p>The first is our work over the past few years to develop new business models for Open Science that move us away from APCs. Those are Article Processing Charges, a fee that authors pay to publish &ndash; instead of a subscription to read.</p>



<p>Back when PLOS was launched and focused in the biomedical sciences, charging authors a fee to publish seemed fair and reasonable. Those authors were awarded huge grants and if a nominal fee meant that anyone could read and reuse the paper, it was a price worth paying.</p>



<p>But we failed to anticipate how successful APCs would become, how commercial publishers would exploit this space, and how inequitable they would become. Waivers would not solve the problem. Continuing down an APC path will further disenfranchise researchers in less generously funded fields, as well as those in low- and middle- income countries and risks deepening existing inequality.</p>



<p>So, we&rsquo;ve chosen a different path. When we launched our new titles last year, we introduced our new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity Model.</a> This model provides a pathway for institutions to cover the cost of unlimited publications for their authors and eliminate APCs. What makes it different is that fees for each institution are adjusted by World Bank lending tier groups to be more reflective of <em>their </em>regional economy. The Global Equity model systematically acknowledges economic differences. It offers an appropriate solution so that authors in these regions do not need to <em>ask </em>for assistance, they are simply included.</p>



<p>We still have a robust <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/">publication fee assistance program</a> for any researcher who cannot afford APCs. But we hope that as our partnerships with institutions expand, this will no longer be the <em>only</em> recourse available to researchers<strong>, </strong>merely a backup option.</p>



<p>A second example is our policy to improve transparency in the reporting of research conducted in other communities. And to limit an action coined as<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> &ldquo;Parachute Science.&rdquo;</a></p>



<p>&ldquo;Parachute science&rdquo; is a term describing how researchers sometimes drop down from an ivory tower in the wealthy Western world into a foreign community for field work. They gather their data, and then zip off home without engaging with or acknowledging the contributions of the local researchers.</p>



<p>This disparity has been reported as far back as 2 decades. One study illustrated that only 6.5% of research articles in general medical journals had a coauthor from the country where the study population lived. I find that number shocking, even if it is now somewhat dated.</p>



<p>The PLOS policy requires information about ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations as well as local authorship. This information is shared with editors and reviewers to help assess whether the research meets the PLOS&rsquo; standards for research integrity.</p>



<p>Our policy has been developed in close collaboration with members of the research community across the globe and includes multiple research areas. We hope the policy will improve awareness of the concerns related to global research, laying foundations for future development of additional policies in this area. And I&rsquo;m delighted to say that several other publishers have reached out for our advice, and have implementing similar policies for their titles, most recently <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife">eLife.</a></p>



<p>There is also an important role for local solutions. Let&rsquo;s return again to that crop scientist in Africa. She decided to publish her findings in an African journal. The improved visibility and accessibility of her research influenced the Kenyan government in developing nutrition schemes for schools. Other African governments have also adopted the schemes. In a significant irony, wealthier countries are now adopting these nutrition findings to support balanced diets.</p>



<p>Creating easier paths to publish Open Science research is only one part of the equation. Next month, I&rsquo;ll talk about what comes next with regards to how we can better change scholarly publishing for all researchers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-starlight-galaxy-quasar-black-hole">In a first, JWST detected starlight from distant galaxies with quasars</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>CAMBRIDGE, MASS. —</strong> For the first time, astronomers have detected starlight from distant galaxies that host extremely bright supermassive black holes called quasars.</p>



<p>Data from the James Webb Space Telescope reveal that four of these galaxies are massive, compact and possibly disk-shaped, astronomers report June 12 at the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~eilers/firstlight.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JWST First Light meeting</a>. Studying the galaxies could help solve the mystery of how black holes in the early universe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big">grew so big so fast</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/21</em>).</p>





<p>“Ever since the discovery of [distant] quasars, there have been studies trying to detect their host galaxies,” said MIT astrophysicist Minghao Yue. But until JWST’s sharp infrared eyes came along, it wasn’t possible. “This opens up brand new windows towards finally understanding luminous quasars and their host galaxies.”</p>



<p>Quasars are black holes that are feeding so furiously, the material they gobble heats to white-hot temperatures, shining brighter than the stars in the galaxy around them. They’re so bright and distant that each appears as a single, starlike point of light.</p>



<p>Two independent groups used that starlike quality to erase the black hole glow from images of their galaxies, like a sculptor coaxing a figure out of marble.</p>



<p>Yue and colleagues used JWST to observe six quasar-hosting galaxies. Around the same time, astrophysicist Xuheng Ding of the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Tokyo and colleagues used JWST to look at another pair of quasars. The light from all the quasars was emitted more than 12.8 billion years ago, or less than a billion years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>The teams used actual stars in the images to simulate the starlike shapes of the quasars. Then they subtracted the simulated quasar from the image of each whole galaxy, and voilà: Only starlight remained.</p>



<p>Ding’s team got a direct peek at both of their galaxies, while Yue’s team glimpsed two of their six. All the measured galaxies appear to be less than a tenth as wide as the Milky Way, measuring between 2,600 and 8,000 light-years across. The two galaxies that Yue and colleagues observed contain enough stars to make up between 10 billion and 100 billion times the mass of the sun, the researchers estimate. The pair that Ding and colleagues looked at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14329" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weigh in at about 25 billion and 63 billion solar masses</a>, the team reported at the meeting and in a study to appear in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Those masses are comparable to that of all the stars in the Milky Way, which in total add up to roughly 60 billion times the mass of the sun. That’s surprisingly massive for so early in the universe’s history.</p>



<p>What’s more, the galaxies seem to break a rule set by observations of galaxies in the nearby universe. Locally, galaxies tend to split their mass between stars and black holes in a predictable way: The more massive its central supermassive black hole, the more stars a galaxy has. These galaxies appear to pack more mass into their black hole than their amount of stars should allow.</p>



<p>“At least for these luminous quasars, they really are over-massive,” Yue said.</p>



<p>The mass calculations might prove to be overestimates, says astrophysicist Paul Shapiro of the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in either study. Converting the light that JWST can see into stars rests on assumptions about how many stars of various masses a galaxy has. Modern galaxies have a lot more dim, lightweight stars than bright, hefty ones, so astronomers typically assume that the brightest stars they see are just the tip of the iceberg. But that might not have been the case 800 million years after the Big Bang, Shapiro says.</p>





<p>“You’re observing the tail and inferring the dog,” he says. “If there were a mass distribution that favors high-mass stars, you could be significantly overestimating the mass associated with the light.”</p>



<p>But “the fact that we can see it at all is very exciting,” says astronomer Madeline Marshall of the National Research Council Canada in Victoria. The fact that two groups are reporting starlight from quasar hosts independently is very convincing, she says.</p>



<p>“Pre-JWST, we could not detect host galaxies of [distant] quasars,” she said at the meeting. “Now, with only the first year of observations … we can actually detect some of these hosts for the first time.”</p>



<p>These first few quasar hosts are just the beginning, Ding says. JWST is scheduled to observe at least 10 more, some of which are even farther away. A larger sample will help astronomers figure out enduring cosmic riddles about how black holes and galaxies influence each other as they grow.</p>



<p>“We don’t know how black holes can be so big in the early universe,” Ding says. “You need to understand the environment of this monster, how it can collect so much matter to it. So knowing the conditions — the mass of the host galaxies, for example — at least then you can say how their local environment is.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genomics-daphne-martschenko-scientists-to-watch">Daphne Martschenko is a champion for ethical, inclusive genomics research</a></h4>

              
                <p>Daphne Martschenko found inspiration for her career at summer camp. For five summers, beginning after her junior year in college at Stanford University, Martschenko worked at Camp Phoenix, which is for youth from low-income backgrounds in the San Francisco Bay Area, primarily Oakland and San Jose. </p>



<p>Camp Phoenix focuses on “joyful learning in an outdoor camp environment,” she says, and her experiences there ignited her passion for making education more equitable for students, regardless of their race or socioeconomic background.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3124149" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-SN10-bug_REV.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></figure></div>


<p>She ultimately pursued a Ph.D. in education, but today her work goes beyond that field. Now a bioethicist at Stanford University, Martschenko is interested in how findings from social and behavioral genomics — the study of how genetic differences among individuals influence complex behaviors and social outcomes — affect society at large, including inequity and injustice and how we respond to them. </p>



<p>With abundant access to genetic information, researchers can now ask new questions about what influences human behavior. But such studies can be prone to bias and can be misinterpreted or co-opted to promote unscientific and even harmful ideas.</p>





<p>Today’s science tells us <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/race-label-genetic-stigma-diversity">that race has no basis in genetics</a>, but genetics has been invoked throughout history to justify slavery, racial discrimination, forced sterilization, xenophobic immigration policies and more. A white gunman who killed 10 Black people in a Buffalo supermarket in 2022 <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-must-consider-the-risk-of-racist-misappropriation-of-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited a genetic study to support his heinous act</a>.</p>



<p>Martschenko&#8217;s work focuses on how genomics research can be conducted in a way that is social and ethical, can include community engagement and can be clearly communicated. She looks at the downstream effects of the research, especially social harms, and develops strategies to prevent those harms. She wants to stop “the unintended consequences of our research from playing out,” she says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bridging disciplines</h4>



<p>Martschenko brings her life experiences to her work. Her father, Ukrainian, and her mother, Nigerian, were living in Kyrgyzstan before her birth. As a child, she lived for a time in Moscow and Ukraine, but she spent her most formative years in the United States. As a biracial woman who identifies as Black, she has experienced people’s negative perceptions firsthand.</p>



<p>She earned her bachelor’s degree in medical anthropology and Slavic studies and a master’s in politics, development and democratic education. Martschenko’s Ph.D. work, which included focus groups and surveys with primary and secondary school teachers, looked at how genomics research on cognitive abilities and educational attainment affected how teachers thought about their students and whether they believed the research was relevant to their teaching. There’s a tendency to think of students in certain racial groups as “not having certain abilities,” she says. She wanted to “contribute to disrupting those harmful narratives.”</p>



<p>More recently, Martschenko has helped create a <a href="https://elsihub.org/collection/race-genetics-and-genetics-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading list</a> that draws on scientific papers from social psychology, sociology, genetics education and more to explore how people think about the relationship between race and genetics. She has also built a publicly available repository of open-access <a href="https://www.thehastingscenter.org/genomic-findings-on-social-and-behavioral-outcomes-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQs on genomics studies</a> for The Hastings Center. This repository aims to make materials that communicate the context, scope and limitations of studies more accessible and so help prevent misinterpretation and misapplication of those studies.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Setting out the facts</h3>



<p>Daphne Martschenko has helped put together <a href="https://www.thehastingscenter.org/genomic-findings-on-social-and-behavioral-outcomes-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a repository of frequently asked questions on genomic studies</a>, which aims to communicate the findings of social and behavioral genomics in a responsible way. An example FAQ for the study “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8159746/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Childhood trauma, life-time self-harm, and suicidal behaviour and ideation are associated with polygenic scores for autism</a>,&#8221; which appeared in <em>Molecular Psychiatry</em>, is shown below.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What did the study examine?</strong> This study examined whether genetic variants associated with autism are also associated with childhood trauma. </p>



<p><strong>What year was it published?</strong> 2019</p>



<p><strong>Key findings</strong></p>



<p>1. Individuals with a greater number of autism-associated genetic variants were more likely to report childhood trauma, self-harm and suicidal ideation.</p>



<p>2. Several social and environmental factors influenced the relationship between autism-associated genetic variants and trauma.</p>



<p>3. It is important to identify sources of trauma for autistic individuals in order to reduce their occurrence and impact.</p>



<p>4. The associations were very small for all outcomes.</p>

</div>





<p>“The idea of getting out in front of the controversy and explaining things in a clearer way so that they&#8217;re not just reacting to misuses of the science, but they’re trying to get out in front of it — I think that’s the key attribute of her work,” says bioethicist Steven Joffe of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</p>



<p>One strategy Martschenko employs is called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8756526/pdf/main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adversarial collaboration</a>, a term originally coined by the Nobel Prize-winning economist and behavioral psychologist Daniel Kahneman. This approach invites people with opposing viewpoints together to collaborate. They celebrate their disagreements and understand their roots.</p>



<p>To that end, Martschenko is coauthoring a book with Sam Trejo, a quantitative social scientist at Princeton University who uses genomic data to study how social and biological factors shape human development. Martschenko and Trejo have different perspectives on how much genes matter and how to address social inequalities. Their book will unpack the social, ethical and policy issues that have come with the DNA revolution.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engaging diverse perspectives</h4>



<p>Another theme of Martschenko’s work is community engagement. She seeks ways for study participants to be equal partners with researchers. Getting people together, particularly those who haven’t been historically included in conversations around how to study genetics and behavior, helps makes science more inclusive and equitable, Martschenko says. “We need more marginalized representation in research,” she adds, but building trust and access is key.</p>



<p>It’s not enough to have study participants just give an OK for you to use their data, says Barbara Koenig, a medical anthropologist who works in bioethics at the University of California, San Francisco. “My sense is that we have to move away from consent,” she says; study participants need to be collaborators.</p>



<p>Recently, Martschenko, another facilitator and eight community partners came together to design a framework for introducing polygenic scores — a measure of a person’s risk for a disease based on genetic factors — into clinical care. When and how to use such scores in providing health care has been a contentious issue, since they can prove inaccurate and be misinterpreted. Martschenko hopes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36765027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the work provides a framework</a> for others who want to engage local communities in designing clinical programs.</p>



<p>Facilitating conversations on controversial and ethically charged topics, especially as a young researcher, is not easy work. To destress, Martschenko does a lot of yoga. “It is my safe place to go,” she says. She is a champion rower and uses the lessons she has learned from it to get people working in sync regardless of the conditions.</p>



<p>She says her background has prepared her well for her current work. “I feel like I found my space,” she says. “I found the place where I&#8217;m destined, where I&#8217;m meant to do the work that I&#8217;m doing.”</p>

<p>Last September, a researcher at a university in Bangladesh emailed a journal about a paper he had published in 2019. He made a stark admission: the paper contained plagiarism, said Sorif Hossain, a lecturer in statistics at Noakhali Science and Technology University, who called for the article to be promptly retracted.</p>



<p>But the paper remained in place. Only after Retraction Watch contacted the <em>European Journal of Environment and Public Health</em> (<em>EJEPH</em>) last week did it issue a retraction. </p>



<span id="more-127314"></span>



<p>The<a href="https://www.ejeph.com/article/retraction-note-salinity-and-miscarriage-is-there-a-link-impact-of-climate-change-in-coastal-areas-13394"> retraction notice</a> states that the article, “<a href="https://www.ejeph.com/article/salinity-and-miscarriage-is-there-a-link-impact-of-climate-change-in-coastal-areas-of-bangladesh-a-6291">Salinity and Miscarriage: Is There a Link? Impact of Climate Change in Coastal Areas of Bangladesh &#8211; A Systematic Review</a>,” was “retracted due to plagiarism, analysis errors, and writing issues.” The paper has been cited six times, according to Google Scholar (the journal is not indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modestum, <em>EJEPH</em>’s publisher, told Retraction Watch that, following an extended exchange with Hossain, a retraction note was “uploaded to the journal publication system, but final confirmation from the author was not well received and it stayed invisible.”</p>



<p>The publisher also promised to “investigate this issue further and [to] take necessary measures against those involved.”</p>



<p>Retraction Watch became aware of the case earlier this month when Amir Abdoli, an associate professor of medical parasitology at Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in Iran, contacted us about the EJEPH article. Abdoli pointed out that it includedd a figure from a 2016 publication of his, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987716000451?via%3Dihub">Salt and miscarriage: Is there a link?</a>,” in the journal <em>Medical Hypotheses</em>, without permission or even citation.</p>



<p>An analysis using the online comparison tool<a href="https://www.copyscape.com/compare.php"> Copyscape</a> revealed that in addition to the duplication of a figure from Abdoli’s paper, the majority of the 2019 article’s abstract <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Compare-Two-Web-Pages-or-Articles-Copyscape.pdf">closely resembles</a> the abstract of Abdoli’s article in both phrasing and structure, with nearly 45% of the text of Abdoli’s abstract exactly duplicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mustafa Younis, <em>EJEPH</em>’s editor-in-chief, told Retraction Watch that the publisher screens all articles with anti-plagiarism software before they reach him. He referred us to Modestum for further comment.</p>



<p>However, Hossain said that he had repeatedly contacted Modestum, Younis, and Veritas Publications, the journal’s previous publisher, to request that the journal remove or retract the article. He sent the first of these requests to Veritas in January 2021, writing, “I don&#8217;t want to retract the paper but want to remove this paper from this site.”</p>



<p>The publisher explained that the “only option we have is to publish a retraction notice for the article in the upcoming issue.” In a March 2021 email that Retraction Watch has seen, Hossain replied: “I am agreed to proceed with the<strong> retraction procedure </strong>and hope to get the update as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>What happened after the exchange, if anything, is unclear. From the correspondence shared with Retraction Watch, it does not appear that the editor or publisher made any inquiries about the reasons Hossain wanted his paper retracted.</p>



<p>However, in a September 2022 email to Younis and Modestum, Hossain admitted that his paper contained plagiarism and asked for it to be withdrawn or retracted:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My goal is to remove this paper. It has some plagiarism, analysis error, and writing issues. That is why I want to withdraw my paper. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Modestrum acknowledged that Hossain had contacted them and Veritas several times about withdrawing or retracting the article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The author repeatedly asked that the article should be “removed” from the website, and not retracted. We see that, in several occasions, the author agreed with the retraction, and later “changed his plan” and “decided to not retract”. These communications with the earlier publisher took place from January 2021 to March 2021.</p>



<p>Then, during the publisher change, we started receiving another set of “removal” requests from this author. We explained that the article cannot simply be “withdrawn” or “removed” from the journal, and explained the retraction procedure. The retraction note was prepared, it was uploaded to the journal publication system, but final confirmation from the author was not well received and it stayed invisible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Though the retraction notice originally stated that it was published in January 2023 and available online since September 2022, the date was later changed to June 2023. The text of the retraction notice was also changed to offer an explanation for the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emails forwarded to Retraction Watch by Hossain show that while he did ask for his article to be “removed” and not “retracted,” he sometimes used the terms interchangeably.</p>



<p>According to Hossain, he wanted the article retracted because of the duplication of the figure and close paraphrase of the abstract of Abdoli’s 2016 article. At the time of writing the article, his first as an undergraduate student at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh, he said he did not understand how to properly cite and incorporate images and sources, nor the seriousness of his offense.</p>



<p>“However, when I knew that it [was] a big problem,” he said, “then I contacted the journal to retract this article.”</p>



<p>In a September email Hossain said was his last to the publisher until this month, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I have discussed this with my supervisor and decided to <strong>withdraw</strong> my paper.</p>



<p>Kindly take the necessary actions regarding this matter and publish this retraction notice in the current issue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response, Hossain said the publisher responded that they would publish the retraction in the January 2023 issue of the journal. The fact that they did not, he told Retraction Watch, “is really unacceptable.”</p>

Phil is a qualified career development practitioner and currently works as an Associate Professor at the University of Warwick&#8217;s Centre for Lifelong Learning where he is Director of Graduate Studies and teaches on postgraduate courses in career development and career coaching. His work addresses the context, theory, and practice of career development in the contemporary world.</p><p>Discover his thoughts on career development and the future of work. &nbsp;</p><h2>1. What initiatives can organizations put in place to enhance their employees&#8217; careers?</h2><p>One of the best ways organisations can enhance their employees’ careers is through access to career coaching. Career coaching can be accessed through external providers or delivered internally by suitably trained members of staff.</p><p>The key to this training lies in helping the career coach learn how to forge an appropriate relationship between the career coach and the employee. This tends to be seen nowadays as a form of&nbsp;<em>learning alliance</em>. The alliance needs to be initially agreed in relation to the initial, middle, and end phases of career coaching interactions.</p><p>Once established, this coaching relationship can be used to support the career learning of employees in relation to a wide range of topics including career influences, workplace relationships, and career management styles. As part of their training and development, career coaches also need to engage in reflexivity and assessment.</p><p>Read Phil McCash’s article <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.15">“Cultural Learning Theory and Career Development”</a> in <em>The Oxford Handbook of Career Development</em> (2021) for more on cultural learning theory and coaching.</p><h2>2. What are the most common obstacles in career development?</h2><p>One of the biggest problems identified in the career development field is the decline in decent work. This rise in precarious work is resulting in work instability and poverty for growing numbers of workers throughout the world. The reduced availability and quality of jobs globally has negative consequences for the individual, community, and society. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.3">Ellen Gutowski and others argue</a> for the necessity of decent work for all.</p><div><blockquote><p>“Career development theory and practice have the potential to foster a sense of belonging and well-being by facilitating the construction of meaningful life-careers.”</p></blockquote></div><p>A further and related issue is social justice. Career development theory and practice have the potential to foster a sense of belonging and well-being by facilitating the construction of meaningful life-careers. Social justice issues are integral because they are concerned with fairness and equity, (in)equality, cultural diversity, psychosocial well-being, and societal values. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.14">Barrie Irving argues</a> that we need a deeper understanding of social justice and the multiple and complex influences on how “career” is interpreted and “opportunities” are presented. Such an understanding should provide critical insight into the effects of wider sociocultural and political concerns affecting what is deemed possible in the shaping and enactment of career.</p><h2>3. Can career theories be applied globally?</h2><p>Career theories from the Global North have sometimes been imported and applied uncritically in the Global South countries. These theories were developed in different socioeconomic and cultural contexts than those of the Global South, which can generally be characterized by vulnerability and instability. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.17">Marcelo Ribeiro argues</a> that these theories and practices must be contextualized if they are to be of assistance to the users of career development services. Through intercultural dialogue, we need to contextualize theories to assist people with their career issues and foster social justice. We also need to understand career theories and practices produced in the Global South (Latin America, Africa, and developing countries of Asia) and their potential as an alternative to expand the mainstream career development theories from the North. Such theories can be understood as a Southern contribution to the social justice agenda.</p><h2>4. How does increased flexibility impact employees and organizations?</h2><p>Increased flexibility and its impact have been debated in the field of organisational studies for many years. Organizational career development theory highlights three different perspectives on career.</p><p>First, and most commonly, organizations are seen as the context that constrains and enables individual careers. Second, careers may be valued as enhancing or limiting organizational performance and subject to talent management practices. Third, careers can be conceptualized as an ongoing process of interaction between individuals, organizations, and the broader social context.</p><p>The move from a focus on organizational careers to highly flexible, self-driven, boundaryless careers in the 1990s overemphasized individual choice and individual responsibility. These ideas became the accepted rule, leading to a divided workforce, with real choice available only to some categories of workers. The psychological contract between individual and organization was largely undermined, and the role of the organization and the importance of contextual and structural factors were relatively neglected.</p><p>To move forward, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.11">Kate Mackenzie Davey argues</a> that this opposition between organization structure and individual agency is best avoided. The future of organizational career development theory requires an understanding of both the individual and social context, and their interaction over time.</p><h2>5. What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?</h2><p>Debates about the future shape of the working world feature regularly in the field of organisational and managerial career studies. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.12">Hugh Gunz and Wolfgang Mayrhofer propose a Social Chronology Framework</a> in which the study of careers should be seen to involve the simultaneous application of three perspectives: being, space, and time. Building on this, they emphasise the importance of a coevolutionary perspective. Within a bounded social and geographic space, career development happens based on configurations of individual and collective career actors who provide context for each other and coevolve together. They argue that this approach can suggest new ways of seeing established career development arrangements.</p><p>In addition, the world of work is inevitably shaped by public policy frameworks. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.6">Christian Percy and Vanessa Dodd set out a conceptual model</a> of the economic outcomes of career development work. It is centred on the financial metrics that are most important to stakeholders at three different tiers of the economy. These tiers include individuals, organizations/employers, and the state. Empirical examples from the literature are provided to show that financial impacts can be identified at each tier. The limitations of the model and the evidence base are discussed. In addition, a critical examination of a narrow focus on economic outcomes in public policy is presented in order to convey the limitations of an economistic rationale for career development.</p><p>Taking this further, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190069704.013.9">Pete Robertson explores</a> and questions the aims of public policy for career development. In the early years of the twenty-first century, an international consensus emerged in the literature describing the intentions of governments when they seek to intervene in the careers of their citizens. He makes a case for a broader conception of the socially desirable outcomes from career interventions. Drawing on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, he proposes a systematic framework of six types of policy goal for career development services:</p><ol><li>labour market goals</li><li>educational goals</li><li>social equity goals,</li><li>health and well-being goals,</li><li>environmental goals, and</li><li>peace and justice goals.</li></ol><p>The latter three categories represent new or relatively neglected areas of focus. The proposal highlights cross-cutting themes of social justice, sustainability, and societal change within public policy for career development in the coming years.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/pages/what-is-the-future-of-work?utm_campaign=1600526366456057904&amp;utm_source=oupblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=button&amp;utm_term=mccash"><strong>Visit the Rethink Work hub for more organizational psychology insights</strong></a></p></blockquote><p><em><sub>Featured image: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/747389663/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/747389663/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f06%2fCareer-development-stock-image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/747389663/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-eduardo-salas-and-scott-tannenbaum/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Eduardo Salas and Scott Tannenbaum</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/finding-purpose-for-the-corporate-office/">Finding purpose for the corporate office</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/06/rethinking-the-future-of-work-an-interview-with-veronica-schmidt-harvey-and-kenneth-p-de-meuse/">Rethinking the future of work: an interview with Veronica Schmidt Harvey and Kenneth P.

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Cover-Photo-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><h4>Menstruation in a Refugee Settlement</h4>
<p>In humanitarian settings, individuals who menstruate face numerous obstacles in managing their menstrual health (MH). The barriers are profound, including scarcity of sanitary materials, washing supplies, and safe, private spaces for changing and disposal.</p>
<p>Despite a growing <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/programs/gate/our-work/menstruation-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commitment</a> from the humanitarian field to address MH through the introduction of new guidelines, research, and programming, the solutions introduced to combat these challenges have often fallen short. They are implemented across diverse humanitarian settings without sufficient tailoring to address unique contextual nuances, such as geographical factors, existing infrastructure, and cultural beliefs surrounding menstruation. Most importantly, the voices of those directly affected — residents of humanitarian spaces, particularly individuals who menstruate — are rarely included in the design and development processes.</p>
<h4>A Human-Centered Design Approach</h4>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://wearealight.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alight</a>, a non-profit organization in the humanitarian sector, and <a href="https://www.kujakuja.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuja Kuja</a>, a global data collection firm, our team at <a href="https://www.ylabsglobal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YLabs</a>, a global design and research organization, set out to develop a Human-Centered Design (HCD) solution with and for individuals who menstruate in the Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda in 2020.</p>
<p>HCD is an approach that prioritizes the needs, perspectives, and experiences of end beneficiaries, and uses a creative and participatory process in co-designing, developing, and testing potential solutions. In our case, this meant deeply involving individuals who menstruate and other community stakeholders, allowing them to lead on key decision-making points.</p>
<p>One of the processes used to ensure that end beneficiaries are highly involved in the development of solutions is called co-design. Co-design is grounded in the belief that all people are creative and, as experts of their own experiences, bring different points of view that inform design and innovation direction. During the co-design process, we used various participatory activities such as card sorting, journey mapping, and role playing to gain deeper insights and challenge assumptions about our potential solutions. Overall, we conducted over 340 interviews, focus group discussions, and working sessions to ensure we were building something that was addressing the primary needs of individuals who menstruate.</p>

<p>In total, four concepts were tested to assess their desirability, cultural acceptability, and feasibility. Among these interventions, the Cocoon Mini emerged as the most promising concept. The Cocoon Mini is a secure and private MH management-dedicated space that offers access to a personal latrine, a bathing facility, and waste disposal options. Based on its potential, we advanced the Mini into a three-month pilot program.</p>
<h4> From Co-Design to Design Principles</h4>
<p>Throughout the research, co-design, and prototyping phases, we created four design principles and a set of tips for how to design MH spaces in humanitarian settings at scale.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring physical and physiological safety among individuals who menstruate is more important than the MH space itself.
<ul>
<li>During prototyping of the Cocoon Mini, individuals who menstruate raised concerns about the potential risks of abuse, both physically and psychologically, that they might face from men and boys. They shared that when public spaces are explicitly designated for MH, they can draw unwanted attention. To address this, we worked together with young people to redesign existing latrines, prioritizing safety and user-friendliness.</li>
<li>Tips to ensure safety at scale: Maximize privacy in every MH space to ensure user safety and discretion. Incorporate essential elements like tall privacy walls, robust doors with secure locks, interior lights, clearly-lit pathways to the structure, and lockable disposal bins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spaces should cater to every stage of the menstrual management journey, addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals who menstruate.
<ul>
<li>Individuals who menstruate highlighted that current solutions tend to prioritize one aspect of menstrual health management, such as the distribution of sanitary materials. Through a collaborative brainstorming session, we identified the essential features and components necessary for a comprehensive approach that covers all stages of menstrual management, including changing, bathing, washing, and proper disposal of products.</li>
<li>Tips for comprehensiveness at scale: Build spaces that integrate bathing shelters equipped with hooks, shelves, and a platform for bathing and laundering, a water source tap, and a disposal bin with a lock and an attached incinerator to ensure the complete destruction of products.

</ul>
</li>
<li>The value of a MH space will be measured by its material longevity.
<ul>
<li>Temporary or makeshift structures are prevalent in humanitarian settlements and are prone to rapid degradation. Through co-design, we learned that individuals who menstruate highly value and desire spaces that are durable, long-lasting, and seen as permanent in the community.</li>
<li>Tips for durability at scale: When possible, prioritize the use of robust materials like iron sheets for privacy walls, treated timber to protect against termites and rot, and bricks with enhanced mineral composition and stronger aggregate. Additionally, consider incorporating timber and mesh reinforcements for latrine pits to ensure long-term durability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community ownership fosters the long-term sustainability of MH spaces
<ul>
<li>During the co-design process, community ownership and responsibility emerged as a crucial aspect for ensuring the sustainability and acceptance of a Cocoon Mini from local stakeholders.</li>
<li>Tips for sustainability at scale: Involve local masons and community members in the construction and maintenance of the Mini spaces. This approach not only strengthens the sense of ownership, but also improves the longevity of the spaces and develops local expertise for future construction projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Piloting the Cocoon Mini</h4>
<p>During the pilot phase, 20 Cocoon Minis were built within individual compounds in the settlement, each assigned a supervisor from the household for maintenance purposes. Overall, the 20 Cocoon Minis served an estimated 300 people, garnering significant desirability and acceptance within the community. <strong>An overwhelming 95% of participants expressed that the Cocoon Mini made managing menstrual health easier for them.</strong></p>
<p><em> </em><em>“The Mini has made MH easier because bathing is possible now with access to water, a disposal bin, and light to use at night hours.”</em> &#8211; Individual who menstruates, age 31</p>
<p>The Cocoon Mini pilot had many key achievements. Notably, there were no reported safety incidents throughout the pilot period, highlighting the effectiveness of the Minis in providing a safe, secure environment. Additionally, the Minis positively influenced mobility within the settlement, granting individuals the freedom to move around knowing they had dedicated spaces for managing their menstruation. This eliminated the need for them to return home and offered convenience and flexibility. Overall, the Cocoon Mini pilot successfully prioritized safety, improved hygiene practices, and enhanced mobility for individuals who menstruate in the community.</p>
<p><em> </em><em>“I can now bathe three times a day when menstruating because of easy access to water and the privacy of the bathroom. The one we had before had holes in it, so I was not able to bathe during the day due to fear that people may see me.”</em> &#8211; Individual who menstruates, age 15</p>
<figure id="attachment_13246" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_13246" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="wp-image-13246 size-medium" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Photo-4-300x279.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="279" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Photo-4-300x279.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Photo-4-1024x953.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Photo-4-768x714.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Photo-4-1536x1429.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Photo-4-2048x1905.jpg 2048w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Photo-4-640x595.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_13246" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">Illustration of the Cocoon Mini and all its different features (Illustration: Snigdha Pamula)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<h4>Thinking About Scale</h4>
<p>The scalability of the Cocoon Mini extends well beyond the Bidi Bidi Settlement, presenting numerous opportunities for co-designing solutions that cater to specific needs in different contexts. However, we emphasize the importance of adopting a holistic approach that combines both &#8220;hardware&#8221; (infrastructure) and &#8220;software&#8221; (social behavioral interventions) to ensure sustainable and lasting change. By integrating these two components, organizations can create comprehensive solutions that address the multifaceted nature of menstrual health management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips for holistic MH approach at scale: Consider conducting sensitivity training sessions with men, boys, and sanitation workers, as well as organizing educational forums on sexual and reproductive health. These initiatives can help prevent misinformation, raise awareness about menstrual health, STIs, and overall reproductive health, and foster a more inclusive and supportive environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>The Cocoon Mini project served as a successful proof of concept, showcasing the effectiveness of HCD methodology in co-designing MH interventions. By engaging individuals who menstruate and key community stakeholders, we developed a solution that addressed their priorities, including safety, privacy, holistic MH management, and sustainability.

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Yaqoob Muhammad will talk about his recently finished PhD in the presentation entitled &quot;The evolution, analysis and design of spiking neural networks for temporal pattern recognition&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>All sensory stimuli are temporal in structure. How a pattern of action potentials encodes
the information received from sensory stimuli is essential for the transmission and
interpretation of sensory information by the nervous system. Although it is clear that
information is carried by the number or the timing of spikes, the information processing
in the nervous system is poorly understood. One way to understand the mechanisms which
enable SNNs to perform a computational task is to associate the structural connectivity of
the network with the corresponding functional behavior. This work demonstrates the
structure-function mapping of small spiking networks evolved for recognizing temporal
patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-origin-giant-mystery-gecko">DNA has revealed the origin of this giant ‘mystery’ gecko</a></h4>

              
                <p>A lizard called Delcourt’s giant gecko has long been one of herpetology’s biggest mysteries — literally. </p>



<p>Presumed extinct, the animal is by far the largest gecko known to have crawled the Earth, measuring at least 600 millimeters, or about two feet, from snout to tail tip. The only example scientists have of the gecko, however, is a single <a href="https://musees.marseille.fr/le-gecko-geant-de-delcourt-du-museum-de-marseille-hoplodactylus-delcourti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">museum specimen</a>, preserved in the 19th century with no notes as to its origin or identity.</p>





<p>Now, DNA from the specimen reveals that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35210-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the colossal lizard belongs to a group of New Caledonian “diplodactylid” geckos</a>, researchers report June 19 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Geckos in this lineage repeatedly evolved extreme body sizes on the archipelago east of Australia.</p>



<p>“Compared to all other geckos, it’s monstrous,” says Matthew Heinicke, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. “It happens to be in a lineage where evolution of gigantism wasn’t a one-off event.”</p>

<p>Previously dubbed <em>Hoplodactylus delcourti</em>, the gecko was renamed <em>Gigarcanum delcourti</em> in the new study, placing the animal in its own genus whose name means “giant mystery.” It is about 50 percent as long and several times as heavy as the largest living gecko species (<em>Rhacodactylus leachianus</em>), also a member of the New Caledonian group.</p>



<p>Likely a nocturnal hunter,<em> G. delcourti</em> was big enough to prey on birds and lizards, including other geckos. Its toe pads and long claws suggest it lived in trees, though it was probably the maximum size at which a gecko&nbsp;could still adhere to vertical surfaces with its hallmark sticky grip, Heinicke says.</p>



<p>The gecko came to scientists’ attention in the 1980s after collections manager Alain Delcourt found the long-forgotten specimen at the Natural History Museum of Marseille in France. Stuffed rather than stored in spirits, the gecko sports a thick trunk, bulbous head and brown skin with faint red bands. Herpetologist Aaron Bauer of Villanova University in Pennsylvania was a graduate student when he arrived at the museum in 1983 to investigate the newly rediscovered specimen.</p>



<p>When Delcourt removed the enormous gecko from a cabinet, “my jaw dropped,” Bauer says.</p>



<p>Bauer cowrote the first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03014223.1986.10422655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">description</a> of the species in 1986, placing the reptile with a New Zealand gecko group based on its&nbsp;physical characteristics. He also suggested that because of its coloring and size, the gecko could be the <a href="https://www.theopennotebook.com/2012/02/23/ask-ton-edits-suggestions-or-demands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>kawekaweau</em></a> — a huge arboreal lizard from the folklore of the Indigenous Māori people.</p>

Bauer</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Since then, techniques for retrieving and analyzing archival DNA have accelerated, allowing scientists to glean new information from degraded museum specimens, including of extinct species such as the dodo and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reviving-extinct-dna">thylacine</a>, also known as the Tasmanian tiger (<em>SN: 5/19/08</em>).</p>



<p>Heinicke, Bauer and colleagues revisited the mysterious giant gecko, extracting and analyzing DNA from one of its femurs. That genetic material rewrote <em>G. delcourti</em>’s origin story, showing that it is not even closely related to New Zealand’s geckos. The diplodactylid geckos of New Caledonia and New Zealand are separated by about 45 million years of evolution.</p>





<p>The team’s finding “turns things on their head,” as gecko geeks worldwide have long associated <em>G. delcourti</em> with New Zealand, says Paul Doughty, a herpetologist at the Western Australian Museum in Perth. “But this is the thing about these precious museum specimens. With new technology, they can give up new secrets.”</p>



<p>Not everyone is surprised by the finding. Trevor Worthy, a paleontologist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, previously suggested that <em>G. delcourti</em> may have come from New Caledonia, given its absence in New Zealand’s extensive fossil record. “You would think that … such a big animal would have turned up, and there was no sign of it,” Worthy says. “It’s exciting to see this mystery cleared up.”</p>



<p>Could <em>G. delcourti</em> still be nestled in the treetops of New Caledonia?</p>



<p>It’s unlikely, but possible, the researchers say. New geckos continue to be discovered on the islands. “I’d like to hold out at least a tiny glimmer of hope that there could be something out there,” Bauer says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-patagonia-duck-billed-dinosaurs">New fossils from Patagonia may rewrite the history of duck-billed dinosaurs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fossils from the southern tip of Chile are adding a wrinkle to researchers’ understanding of how duck-billed dinosaurs conquered the Cretaceous world.</p>



<p>Duck-billed dinos known as hadrosaurids were highly successful and lived on most continents by the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 million years ago. Now, a study shows that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg2456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an older duck-billed lineage</a> appears to have thrived some 72 million years ago in subantarctic South America, potentially millions of years before hadrosaurids reached the continent, researchers report June 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>“It’s yet another chapter in the dispersion of these dinosaurs that we did not know about,” says Jhonatan Alarcón-Muñoz, a paleontologist at the University of Chile in Santiago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About a decade ago, paleobiologist Marcelo Leppe of the Chilean Antarctic Institute in Punta Arenas was searching for plant fossils in the Río de las Chinas Valley in Chile’s Magallanes region when he spotted fossilized bones. After bringing the finding to the attention of Alexander Vargas, a paleontologist at the University of Chile, researchers extracted the bones for study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alarcón-Muñoz, Vargas, Leppe and their colleagues determined the bones belong to a new type of duck-billed dinosaur — herbivorous giants that had flattened, waterfowl-like snouts. The remains included many body parts, with pieces of hip, limbs, ribs, vertebrae and skull recovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers named the animal <em>Gonkoken nanoi</em>, “gon” and “koken” being the words for “similar to” and “wild duck or swan” in the language of the Indigenous Aónikenk people from the part of southern Patagonia where the bones were found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In all, the researchers suspect they found four distinct <em>Gonkoken</em> individuals. No remains of other animals were found with them, suggesting the dinosaurs were probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/duck-billed-dinosaurs-roamed-arctic-herds">moving in a herd</a>, Vargas says (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/9/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Gonkoken</em> isn’t like other known South American duck-billed dinosaurs, or like any from the old southern supercontinent of Gondwana, which included what came to be South America. Until now, all known duck-billed dinosaurs from Gondwana were hadrosaurids, which had their heyday in the late Cretaceous and had such efficient, stacked, plant-pulverizing teeth that they chewed their way to nearly global dominance, outcompeting other herbivorous dinosaur groups. <em>Gonkoken</em> appears to be part of an older, less specialized lineage that diverged from other duck-billed dinosaurs around 91 million years ago, before the first hadrosaurids evolved, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Gonkoken</em>’s ducklike snout had a simpler construction than that of hadrosaurids, Alarcón-Muñoz says, and it had fewer rows of teeth in its chewing surface. <em>Gonkoken</em> was also relatively small — about four meters long — while some hadrosaurids were true titans, reaching about 15 meters in length.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061523_JP_new-duckbill_inline.jpg" alt="A 3D image of a skeleton reconstruction of a Gonkoken nanoi." class="wp-image-3129020" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061523_JP_new-duckbill_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061523_JP_new-duckbill_inline-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129020">The 3D skeletal reconstruction of <em>Gonkoken nanoi</em> is made from scanning the original, unearthed bones of the animal, along with bones reconstructed from other duck-billed dinosaur species.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129020">Francisco Hueichaleo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Seeing a non-hadrosaurid duck-billed dinosaur in South America like <em>Gonkoken</em> is “somewhat unexpected,” says David Evans, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the research. The discovery “makes us rethink their biogeographic history in the Americas in interesting ways.”</p>



<p>For example, rather than a single colonization of the continent, the team thinks that duck-billed dinos arrived in South America from North America in two separate waves. “We suspect our kind of duck-billed dinosaur arrived earlier into South America and reached further south than the hadrosaurids,” says Alarcón-Muñoz, describing <em>Gonkoken</em> as a relict. “In most other places of the world, this kind of dinosaur had already gone extinct by this time.”</p>





<p>The findings may also mean that hadrosaurids were not quite as widespread as previously thought. Fragmentary remains in southern Patagonia and Antarctica that were thought to belong to hadrosaurids may actually be <em>Gonkoken</em> or its close relatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many other outcrops along the Río de las Chinas are studded with dinosaur bones. The researchers want to examine these to see if they belong to <em>Gonkoken</em> as well. &nbsp;Finding more skull bones of <em>Gonkoken</em>, Evans says, could be key for figuring out exactly how it was related to other duck-billed dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-tipping-trouble-climate-cerrado">The Amazon might not have a ‘tipping point.’ But it’s still in trouble</a></h4>

              
                <p>The shore of a sea of nearly 400 billion trees winds through the central Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. Here, the Amazon rainforest rubs up against the Cerrado, the world’s largest savanna.</p>



<p>The two are distinct worlds — one a wet and verdant jungle, the other relatively dry and blanketed in wild grasses, shrubs and small trees. But no clear line demarcates the Amazon and the Cerrado. Instead, there’s a messy transition zone, a continuum of vegetation that grows taller toward the rainforest. Over thousands of years, the boundary ebbs and flows, driven by natural fluctuations in climate.</p>





<p>“But in this formula is a new element,” says ecologist Beatriz Marimon of Mato Grosso State University in Nova Xavantina. Humans, with their ambitions to domesticate the land, she says.</p>



<p>About half a century ago, throngs of people started streaming into the region along new highways, clearing forest for farmland and cattle ranches, she says. Fifty years is a blink in the life span of a forest nearly as old as the dinosaurs, but it’s plenty of time for humans to remodel a landscape.</p>



<p>In 2007, earth system scientist Carlos Nobre, now at the University of São Paulo, and his colleagues suggested that much of the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL030612" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon could transform into a savanna</a> if deforestation exceeded 40 percent of the forest’s original area, which was mostly whole before the 1970s. </p>



<p>About a decade later, after accounting for interactions between climate change, deforestation and fire, Nobre and a colleague offered a more dire warning. If <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat2340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 20 to 25 percent of the Amazon was deforested</a> and global warming reached about 2.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the ecosystem could collapse and much of the forest could transform into savanna and shrubland, they found. Today, humans have already deforested about 17 percent of the overall Amazon, and damaged much more, estimates suggest.</p>

<p>That the Amazon may transform into something else after reaching a point at which it cannot cope with exacerbating conditions — a “tipping point” — has raised alarms. Such a shift would imperil the forest’s storied biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions of people. It would also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-could-flip-parts-amazon-carbon-sponge-source-2050">release immense volumes of carbon dioxide</a> and alter the global circulation of heat, vastly complicating efforts to slow climate change (<em>SN Online: 1/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>The Amazon is in grave trouble, scientists agree. Human activities and climate change are exacerbating the dry season; in some areas, it lasts four to five weeks longer than decades ago. Fires have also become more fierce. All of that is stressing the forest out.</p>



<p>But much like the physical transition separating the Amazon from the Cerrado, the forest’s limit is probably not defined by a single, clear tipping point, many scientists now say. The Amazon is no monolith. Different parts may react to threats in different ways, Marimon says.</p>





<p>A multitude of poorly understood factors affect the forest’s fate: The myriad forms of human actions. Climate change. The diverse capabilities and adaptations of plants. The ambit of underground water.</p>



<p>Ongoing research is clarifying if, when and where conditions may push the forest beyond its limits, and could help inform efforts to save the forest from potential widespread dieback. These are urgent tasks, as it’s not yet clear how much time may remain to save the forest, or if it’s already at the brink of some irreversible shift, says Matt Finer, director of the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project, or MAAP, based in Washington, D.C. In either case, he says, “we’re kind of probably the last ones with the option to ponder that.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Felling the Amazon</h4>



<p>Ecologically speaking, the Amazon is without equal. It accounts for more than half of Earth’s remaining tropical forests, through which roughly 17 percent of the world’s river water flows. It also houses about 1 in 4 of the world’s land-dwelling species. That unfathomable bonanza includes its flowers: More types of flowers bloom in the Amazon than there are stars visible to the naked eye in the night sky. What’s more, each year the rainforest absorbs about 5 percent of the world’s annual CO<sub>2</sub><strong> </strong>emissions from fossil fuel burning and land use changes, with its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">carbon reserves</a> weighing as much as 230 million blue whales (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>Much of this vitality is sustained by the trade winds, which blow east to west across the forest from the Atlantic Ocean. The winds carry sea-born moisture into the eastern parts of the forest, where it precipitates. Once fallen, some of this water evaporates back into the air. Much of it soaks into the soil. It’s absorbed by roots, courses up through plant stems and tree trunks, and is then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forest-trees-reduce-global-warming-climate-cooling-carbon">transpired through leaves</a> back to the sky (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 9</em>). A single tree in the Amazon can pump 500 liters of water into the atmosphere each day.</p>



<p>Winds whisk the moisture hundreds of kilometers deeper into the forest, where it rains on more trees. A single molecule of water may repeat this cycle more than five times before exiting the forest basin. The Amazon waters itself.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The rainforest as rainmaker</h3>



<p>Winds carry moisture into the eastern Amazon, where it falls as rain. Much of it soaks into the soil, where some water is taken up by roots and ultimately transpired through leaves back into the air. Winds then carry this moisture deeper into the forest, where the cycle repeats (left). But cutting down trees reduces the water taken up by roots and evapotranspiration (right). That breaks the cycle, increasing local runoff and reducing rainfall in the interior.</p>

<p>But this arrangement has vulnerabilities. If enough of the forest’s eastern expanses are cut down, moisture may run off and out of the basin rather than sail into deeper sections of the forest that need it, Finer says. “That deforestation cuts off the whole system.”</p>



<p>Already, <a href="https://maaproject.org/2022/amazon-tipping-point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 30 percent of the Amazon’s eastern third</a> has been cleared, Finer and colleagues reported in a 2022 MAAP report. Deforestation averaged across the whole forest may not yet have crossed that 20 to 25 percent threshold, but “in that eastern third, it’s way worse,” Finer says. If that destructive trend continues in the east, it could decapitate the Amazon’s skyborne streams of moisture, he says. Finer doesn’t think the forest has yet crossed a tipping point, but, like other scientists, stresses it could be hard to know for years.</p>



<p>Even if this rain recycling goes bust, the forest’s western region — about a third of its expanse — could still hold out. This area is backed by the towering Andes, which wring westbound winds of water and ensure that heavy rain falls upon nearby forests. The area’s lush vegetation shouldn’t suffer too terribly from distant deforestation, Nobre says.</p>



<p>Deforestation doesn’t just harm the tracts where trees are felled. The warming and drying that follow in deforestation’s wake may spill over into the edges of intact forests nearby, affecting which plant and animal species persist there. That’s one of the many ways forests become degraded, a condition that’s often less obvious than outright clear-cutting.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it’s pervasive. About 38 percent of the remaining <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon rainforest has been degraded</a>, researchers reported in January in <em>Science</em>. That’s an area equivalent to nearly a third of Brazil, or more than three times the size of Texas.</p>



<p>Degradation can take many forms, with repercussions that vary depending on the damage’s nature, intensity and scope. Fires can raze parts of the rainforest. If the burned land is left alone, Amazon plants typically return on their own, bursting forth from seeds and roots in the soil. But severe fires can destroy these buried remnants too, denying some species the chance to return. As such, the forests that grow back often lack the diversity of their predecessors. Where humans have repeatedly burned the land in the past, the forest may recover more slowly and be dominated by just a few fire-resistant species even after two decades.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, selective logging can open a forest’s closed canopy, ushering in sunlight to heat and dry the understory, killing some plants, exacerbating fires and pushing out animals.</p>



<p>Where degradation reduces vegetation, it shrivels transpiration. For each leaf lost, the forest’s moisture loses one little gate back into the sky. During a typical dry season, severely degraded forests may release 34 percent less water back to the sky. That loss directly sabotages the forest’s rain recycling, imperiling trees that depend upon it.</p>



<p>Because degradation can unfold in so many ways, computer simulations that project changes in the Amazon’s vegetation cannot say exactly how it may contribute to a tipping point.</p>



<p>“It’s logical to think that such degradation helps push the system towards the tipping point, if it really exists,” says earth system scientist David Lapola of the University of Campinas in Brazil. But “we can’t today say this percentage of degradation will make the system tip to another stable state.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A drier future</h4>



<p>The Amazon isn’t just dealing with deforestation and degradation, of course. Over the last 50 years, the average annual temperature across the forest has climbed <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00228/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 0.6 degrees C</a>. And exceptionally severe droughts have struck the forest three times in the last two decades. Some climate models suggest that by 2060, such extreme drought conditions could occur as often as 9 in every 10 years.</p>



<p>Recent climate simulations suggest that if such drought years became the new “climate normal,” patches of the rainforest may transition to a different state — whether that be savanna or a more open or dry forest — at different times, not all at once.</p>



<p>Some of these localized shifts could trigger a domino effect, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2120777119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing nearby areas to also shift</a>, researchers reported last year in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The Amazon’s southeastern forest appears to be highly vulnerable to local diebacks, while areas downwind to the west seem to be liable to the domino effect.</p>



<p>Projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, which coordinates and standardizes climate projections, also point to localized Amazon diebacks. For a 2022 study, researchers examined projections from <a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phase-6-cmip6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sixth phase of the project, or CMIP6</a>, analyzing models that simulate the response of vegetation to climate change. Five of the seven analyzed CMIP6 models indicate that the risk of sudden, local diebacks will climb as the world reaches and surpasses 1.5 degrees C of global warming above preindustrial levels.</p>



<p>But no two projections completely agree. Even when the same amount of climate change is assumed, CMIP6 models produce different pathways, with diebacks occurring at different points. One model predicts diebacks could begin around 1.3 degrees C of warming, another at about 1.7 degrees C.</p>



<p>The lack of agreement comes in part because these models — and others used to predict the Amazon’s fate — make different assumptions about the complex nature of the world’s greatest rainforest.</p>



<p>Taking a closer look at that complexity may reveal ways in which the forest is more — or less — resilient than we think.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hidden nuance in the trees</h4>



<p>Often, talk of “the Amazon” evokes visions of dense, dripping vines and trees. But the forest is actually a messy medley of ecosystems. There are the vivacious várzeas — floodplains occupied by dense forests, grasslands and swamps that, for months of the year, become inundated under nutrient-rich water, which sustain an abundance of fauna and flora.</p>



<p>The várzea’s uliginous counterpart, the igapós, consists of swamp forests that also flood seasonally, though with nutrient-poor waters as dark as maté, steeped in tannins leached from decaying plants. Igapó trees grow slowly, but they grow dense and excel at sequestering carbon.</p>



<p>Then there are the diverse terra firme, the tall, thick, closed canopy jungles that cover the uplands, above the flood line. Even naturally occurring white-sand savannas can be found within the Amazon’s borders. As for trees, roughly 230 species are thought to dominate the forest, while <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1243092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 16,000 species have been cataloged</a> in the basin.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, research projects often simulate the Amazon’s vegetation as relatively homogenous, says earth system scientist Marina Hirota of the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianópolis, Brazil. They cast every tree as a broadleaf evergreen tree, the forest as a monoculture. These simplified simulations, called “big leaf” models, prevail because researchers lack data, Hirota says, but the models don’t do the forest justice.</p>



<p>Over millions of years, the forest’s myriad plant communities have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved differently to cope with local rainfall pattern</a>s. Research suggests that projections may not fully capture how the lush diversity of plant traits affects the Amazon’s ability to endure and adapt to stress like climate change–induced droughts.</p>

<p>Take for instance, embolism resistance. When soils dry, plants may inadvertently suck bubbles of air into their vascular systems, causing a sometimes-lethal blockage called an embolism. Tree species inhabiting the more drought-prone central eastern Amazon tend to grow slower but be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05971-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more resistant to embolism</a> and vascular collapse than species in the forest’s west. Hirota, Marimon and their colleagues reported this finding in April in <em>Nature</em> after studying 129 tree species from 11 plots across the Amazon. The work suggests rainfall patterns have shaped plant communities’ capacities to cope with drought.</p>



<p>Then, there’s what lies underground — the groundwater — which is poorly captured by many simulations. Most investigations into the forest’s response to drought have focused on upland areas overlying deep water tables, which roots struggle to access. But about half of the Amazon may stand atop a relatively shallow water table. That accessible groundwater could sustain plants through droughts in ways that models don’t account for, says ecologist Flávia Costa of Brazil’s National Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus.</p>



<p>Such areas could serve as drought refugia, Costa says: “Places that do not suffer.” But if drought gets too severe and groundwater recedes beyond the reach of roots, refuges could become ruinous. “Those places may be the ones that suffer the most because the plants are not adapted” to dry conditions, she says.</p>



<p>Hirota, Marimon and others are still studying how Amazonian plants are coping with drought to amass more information about what Hirota calls plants’ “life strategies.” The goal is to use the data to improve existing vegetation models and simulate more accurately the diverse responses to climate change and land use changes.</p>



<p>This research, and other investigations into the many capabilities and adaptations of the Amazon’s plants, will be necessary to better inform projections of the Amazon’s fate, Hirota says. The same, Costa says, goes for the influence of groundwater.</p>



<p>A third source of uncertainty in figuring out the Amazon’s fate wafts invisibly through the air. Researchers had previously suggested that an atmosphere richer in CO<sub>2</sub> might boost the forest’s growth, potentially offsetting some of the tolls of climate change. Some experts had even proposed that this “atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization” could preclude a massive forest dieback.</p>



<p>But CO<sub>2</sub> and sunlight aren’t all that’s needed for growth. Plants also consume nutrients from soils, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-created-amazon-dark-earth">Amazonian soils are notoriously lacking</a>, especially in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphorus-earth-earliest-life-forged-lightning-chemistry">phosphorus</a> (<em>SN: 1/28/23, p. 10</em>;<em> SN: 4/10/21, p. 7</em>). Using computer simulations for a 2019 study, Lapola and colleagues found that a dearth of phosphorus would probably reduce the projected growth gains associated with more abundant CO<sub>2</sub> by about 50 percent over 15 years. The team’s conclusion: Previous projections may have overestimated the benefits of extra carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>No large-scale experiments have yet tested the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization on the Amazon. But Lapola and colleagues have almost finished constructing steel towers that will spray carbon dioxide over mature groves in the Amazon, to see how the trees respond. It may still take years to acquire meaningful results.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What comes next?</h4>



<p>At this point, scientists don’t have enough information to say when, or if, the Amazon will cross some threshold beyond which it becomes unrecognizable, Lapola says. Today’s computer models are trying to open doors into the future, to peer beyond thresholds and see what’s ahead for the Amazon. But with the data available today, “we’re looking into a room from the hole of the lock.”</p>



<p>That a web of local diebacks could unravel across the forest is worrisome, but that fragmented fate may carry more hope than a single catastrophic switch, Hirota says. For one, it could help dissuade people from writing the forest off as a lost cause after crossing some predicted limit.</p>



<p>Resignation is a serious concern, Nobre says. “If we take for granted that the tipping point has already been exceeded, then people say forget it.”</p>



<p>Nobre aims to restore some of the forest’s most deforested areas, to tilt the Amazon away from that momentous tip, or to at least rein in the lengthening of the dry season. He and others have called for extensive reforesting along what they call arcs of restoration. “One arc over the southern Amazon, another one along the Andes,” he says. Such work hasn’t yet begun.</p>



<p>Even if it does, restoration alone cannot succeed if deforestation and degradation continue. It takes far less time to timber a tree than to grow one.</p>



<p>Not all human activity has harmed the forest. People from Indigenous groups have acted as stewards of the forest’s biodiversity for millennia. Plants that they domesticated long ago, such as Brazil nut trees and umari trees, are still abundant in some areas near ancient settlements. Today, Indigenous territories as well as protected areas make up more than half of the forest in the Brazilian Amazon. Since 2000, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-01018-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 5 percent of forest loss</a> has occurred on these grounds. Working with the people living in these areas to stave off further deforestation and degradation will be key, researchers say.</p>



<p>But the forest’s fate will depend on more than restoration and conservation efforts in South America. Greenhouse gases emitted by nations around the world are driving many of the challenges the Amazon faces.</p>



<p>And Marimon implores people to stop buying Amazonian beef and other products that fuel the engine of deforestation. Around 75 percent of the land deforested in the Amazon is used as pastures for grazing cattle, and Brazil is now the world’s largest exporter of beef.</p>

<p>Taking real steps to change behavior is in the best interest of all who call this planet home. Beyond the Amazon’s irreplaceable biodiversity, beyond its colossal carbon stores, there are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-teleconnections-droughts-fires">wind and ocean currents</a> that connect the forest to regions across the globe (<em>SN: 3/11/23, p. 9</em>). Amazonian temperature anomalies have been linked to anomalies in the Tibetan Plateau, where glaciers that supply around 2 billion people with drinking water are shrinking, and to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.</p>



<p>Back in Mato Grosso, Marimon suspects that the changes she’s witnessed there could eventually unfold across much of the Amazon. Year after year, more trees disappear and the air is getting hotter. Insects that once buzzed about in throngs have vanished. And in some places, the piercing shrieks of the capitão da mata — an iconic, vociferous bird — have vanished. Shrieks that warned to all who heard them: Danger is afoot.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-mechanics-sound-split-phonon">Physicists split bits of sound using quantum mechanics</a></h4>

              
                <p>You can’t divide the indivisible, unless you use quantum mechanics. Physicists have now turned to quantum effects to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg8715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split phonons</a>, the smallest bits of sound, researchers report in the June 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>It’s a breakthrough that mirrors the sort of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-entanglement-communication-security-bell-test">quantum weirdness</a> that’s typically demonstrated with light or tiny particles like electrons and atoms (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>). The achievement may one day lead to sound-based versions of quantum computers or extremely sensitive measuring devices. For now, it shows that mind-bending quantum weirdness applies to sound as well as it does to light.</p>





<p>“There was no one that had really explored that,” says engineering physicist Andrew Cleland of the University of Chicago. Doing so allows researchers “to draw parallels between sound waves and light.”</p>



<p>Phonons have much in common with photons, the tiniest chunks of light. Turning down the volume of a sound is the same as dialing back the number of phonons, much like dimming a light reduces the number of photons. The very quietest sounds of all consist of individual — and indivisible — phonons.</p>



<p>Unlike photons, which can travel through empty space, phonons need a medium such as air or water — or in the case of the new study, the surface of an elastic material. “What&#8217;s really kind of, in my mind, amazing about that is that these sound waves [carry] a very, very small amount of energy, because it&#8217;s a single quantum,” Cleland says. “But it involves the motion of a quadrillion atoms that are all working together to [transmit] this sound wave.”</p>



<p>Phonons can’t be permanently broken into smaller bits. But, as the new experiment showed, they can be temporarily divided into parts using quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>Cleland and his team managed the feat with an acoustic beam splitter, a device that allows about half of an impinging torrent of phonons to pass through while the rest get reflected back. But when just one phonon at a time meets the beam splitter, that phonon enters a special quantum state where it goes both ways at once. The simultaneously reflected and transmitted phonon interacts with itself, in a process known as interference, to change where it ultimately ends up.</p>



<p>The lab demonstration of the effect relied on sound millions of times higher in pitch than humans can hear, in a device cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero. Instead of speakers and microphones to create and hear the sound, the team used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-designer-molecules-quantum-device-qubit">qubits</a>, which store quantum bits of information (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>). The researchers launched a phonon from one qubit toward another qubit. Along the way, the phonon encountered a beam splitter.</p>



<p>Adjusting the parameters of the setup modified the way that the reflected and transmitted portions of the phonon interacted with each other. That allowed the researchers to quantum mechanically change the odds of the whole phonon turning up back at the qubit that launched the phonon or at the qubit on the other side of the beam splitter.</p>



<p>A second experiment confirmed the quantum mechanical behavior of the phonons by sending phonons from two qubits to a beam splitter between them. On their own, each phonon could end up back at the qubit it came from or at the one on the opposite side of the beam splitter. </p>



<p>If the phonons were timed to arrive at the beam splitter at the exact same time, though, they travel together to their ultimate destination. That is, they still unpredictably go to one qubit or the other, but they always end up at the same qubit when the two phonons hit the beam splitter simultaneously.</p>



<p>If phonons followed the classical, nonquantum rules for sound, then there would be no correlation in where the two phonons go after hitting the beam splitter. The effect could serve as the basis for fundamental building blocks in quantum computers known as gates.</p>





<p>“The next logical step in this experiment is to demonstrate that we can do a quantum gate with phonons,” Cleland says. “That would be one gate in the assembly of gates that you need to do an actual computation.”</p>



<p>Sound-based devices are not likely to outperform <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">quantum computers that use photons</a> (<em>SN: 2/14/18</em>). But phonons could lead to new quantum applications, says Andrew Armour, a physicist at the University of Nottingham in England who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s probably not so clear what those [applications] are at the moment,” Armour says. “What you&#8217;re doing is extending the [quantum] toolbox…. People will build on it, and it will keep going, and there&#8217;s no sign of it stopping any time soon.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-xi-why-large-language-models-are-not-conscious/">Notes on consciousness. (XI) Why large language models are not conscious</a></h4>

              
                <p>The current discussions about AI are plagued
with anthropomorphism. Of course, the name “artificial intelligence” has
probably something to do with the matter. A conscious artificial intelligence might
sound like science-fiction, but a sentient statistical model certainly sounds a
bit more bizarre. In this post, I want to address the following question: are
large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, or more generally deep learning
models, conscious? (perhaps just a little bit?)</p>



<p>The first thing that must be realized is that
the question of what it takes for something to be conscious is a very old
question, which has been the subject of considerable work in the past. The
opinions and arguments that we read today are not original. Very often, they
unknowingly repeat common arguments that have been discussed at length in the
past. It might seem for the general public or AI engineers that the spectacular
successes of modern AI programs should bring a new light on these old
questions, but that is not really the case. These spectacular programs already
existed 50 years ago, just as thought experiments: which for logical arguments
makes no difference at all. For example, in 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Searle
articulated an argument</a> against the idea that a
program that seems to behave like a human would necessarily have a mind. The
argument was based on a thought experiment, where an average English-speaking
person would apply the operations of a sophisticated program that takes a
question written in Chinese as input and outputs an answer in Chinese. Searle
argues that while that person is able to have a conversation in Chinese by
mechanically applying rules, she does not understand Chinese. Therefore, he
concludes, understanding cannot be identified with the production of acceptable
answers. Now such programs exist, and their existence does not change anything
to either the argument or the objections that have been raised then. All these
discussions were precisely based on the premises that such systems would exist.</p>



<p>This is an important preamble: a <em>lot</em>
has been said and written about consciousness, what it means, what it takes for
something to be conscious, etc. Answers to these questions are not to be found
in current AI research but in the philosophy literature, and whether a program
produces convincing answers to questions, or can correctly categorize images,
bears very little relevance to any of these discussions. A corollary is that AI
engineering skills provide no particular authority on the subject of AI
consciousness, and indeed, as far as I can tell, many arguments we hear in the
AI community on this subject tend be rather naïve, or at least not original and
with known weaknesses.</p>



<p>Another important remark is that, while there
is a lot of literature on the subject, there is no consensus whatsoever in the
specialized community on those questions. Views on consciousness go from
consciousness does not exist (eliminativism/illusionism) to everything is
conscious (panpsychism(s)). In my view, there is no consensus because there is currently
no convincing theory of consciousness (some say that there can be no theory of
consciousness, which is another proposition on which there is no consensus).
There are good reasons for this state of affair, which I scratched <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-explained-with-sex/">here</a> and <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-x-why-i-am-not-a-panpsychist-reading-notes-on-philip-goffs-galileos-error/">there</a> (and others have too, obviously).</p>



<p>This remark is important because I have seen
it become an argument for why a particular artefact <em>might</em> be conscious: we
don’t know what consciousness is exactly, or what it takes for something to be
conscious, therefore we cannot rule out the possibility that something in
particular is conscious.</p>



<p>However, this is a fallacy. We do not know
what it takes for an entity to be conscious, but we certainly do know that
certain entities <em>cannot</em> be conscious, if the meaning we give to this
notion must have some vague resemblance with its usual meaning.</p>



<p>Now, I will make a few general points against
the idea that LLMs, or more generally formal deep neural networks, are
conscious, by discussing the concept of a “conscious state” (i.e., “how it
feels like now”).</p>



<p>Once we remove the buzzwords, such as
“intelligence”, “learning”, etc., a modern deep learning model is essentially a
massively parallel differentiable program. In effect, it is essentially a tensor
calculator, the state of which is updated by a series of iterations.</p>



<p>The default assumption in the computational
view of mind is that a mental state is something like a program state. But a
conscious state is a very particular kind of state. First of all, a conscious
state has a subject (the entity that is conscious) and an object (what it is
about). Both relate to well-known topics in philosophy of mind, namely the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/">unity of consciousness</a> and the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-intentionality/">intentionality</a> of consciousness.</p>



<p>When we wonder whether something is conscious,
that thing is typically an organism, or a machine, or even, if you adopt <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-x-why-i-am-not-a-panpsychist-reading-notes-on-philip-goffs-galileos-error/">panpsychism</a>, a rock or an atom. But we could
consider many other combinations of molecules and ask whether they are
conscious. How about the entity made of a piece of my finger (still attached to
my body) plus two coins in a fountain in Rome? This seems absurd, but why? There
is a reason why: two objects that do not interact at all have the same
properties whether we look at them one by one or together. New properties above
the individual elements can only arise if there is some kind of interaction
between the elements. So, if neither my finger nor any of the coins is
conscious, then the combination is not conscious either. Thus, we can say that
a necessary condition for a set of components to constitute a subject is that
there is some causal integration between the components. This is actually the
basis of one particular theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory
(which I have criticized <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-ix-why-integrated-information-theory-fails/">here</a>, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/qd4z9">there</a> and <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/modern-panpsychism-about-the-integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/">there</a>, essentially because a necessary condition is
not a sufficient condition). If a deep learning network is conscious, then
which layer is the subject?</p>



<p>I leave this tricky question hanging there to address the more critical ones (but in case you want to dig, look up these keywords: <a href="http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f17/phil204A/readings/Varela%201979%20Principles%20of%20Biological%20Autonomy.part1.pdf">autonomy of the living</a>, biological organism, biological agency). One is the question of intentionality: the fact that a conscious state is about something: I am conscious of something in particular. A large language model is a symbol processing system. The problem is that it is humans who give meaning to symbols. The program is fed with sequences of bits, and outputs sequences of bits. If one asks an LLM “What is the color of a banana?” and the LLM replies “yellow”, does the program understand what a banana is? Clearly, it doesn’t have the visual experience of imagining a banana. It has never seen a banana. It doesn’t experience the smell or touch of a banana. All it does is output 0100, which we have decided stands for the word banana, when we input a particular stream of numbers. But the particular numbers are totally arbitrary: we could choose to assign a different sequence of numbers to each of the words and we would still interpret the computer’s output in exactly the same way, even though the program would now have different inputs and outputs. So, if the program has a conscious experience, then it is about nothing in particular: therefore, there is no conscious experience at all.</p>



<p>This is known as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_grounding_problem">symbol grounding problem</a>”, again a well-known problem (which I examined in the context of “<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168237v3">neural codes</a>”). Many people consider that a necessary ingredient has to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition">embodiment</a>, that is, the idea that the machine has to have a body interacting with the world (but again, careful, necessary does not mean sufficient). It seems that it is Yann Le Cun’s position, for example. Again, it is not clear at all what it takes for something to be conscious, but it is clear that there can be no conscious experience at all unless that experience is somehow about something, and so the symbol grounding problem must be addressed.</p>



<p>These are well-known problems in philosophy of
mind. The final point I want to discuss here is more subtle. It relates to the
notion of “state”. In computationalism (more generally, functionalism), a
conscious state is a sort of program state. But there is a big confusion here. Both
terminologies use the word “state”, but their meaning is completely different.
A state of mind, an experience, is not at all a “state” in the physical sense
of pressure, volume and so on, that is, the configuration of a system. Consider
a visual experience. Can it be the case that to see something is to have the
brain in a certain state? For example, some neurons in the inferotemporal
cortex fire when a picture of Jennifer Anniston is presented: is the visual
experience of Jennifer Anniston the same as the active state of the neuron? If
the answer is positive, then why should you have the experience, rather than
that neuron? Otherwise, perhaps the neuron <em>triggers</em> the experience, but
then we need to assign the experience to the state of some downstream neurons
and we face the problem of infinite regress.</p>



<p>The issue is that an experience is simply not
a physical state; to treat it as such is a category error. To see this,
consider this thought experiment, which I called the “<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/tgcn9">Bewitched thought experiment</a>” (self-quote):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>In the TV series Bewitched, Samantha the housewife twitches her nose and everyone freezes except her. Then she twitches her nose and everyone unfreezes, without noticing that anything happened. For them, time has effectively stopped. Was anyone experiencing anything during that time? According to the encoding view of conscious experience, yes: one experiences the same percept during the entire time, determined by the unchanging state of the brain. But this seems wrong, and indeed in the TV series the characters behave as if there had been no experience at all during that time.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>It would seem bizarre that people experience
something when their brain state is maintained fixed. That is because to experience
is an <em>activity</em>, not a thing. Therefore, a system cannot experience
something just by virtue of being in some state. The vector of activation
states of a neural network is not a conscious “state”. It is not even false: it
is a category error. So, when a deep network outputs a symbol that we associate
to Jennifer Anniston, it doesn’t actually <em>see</em> Jennifer Anniston. Having
the output “neuron” in a particular state is not an experience, let alone an
experience <em>of</em> seeing Jennifer Anniston.</p>



<p>All these remarks, which tend to show that the
application of tensor calculus does not produce conscious experience, can be
perplexing because it is hard to imagine what else could possibly produce
conscious experience. Current “artificial intelligence” is our best shot so far
at mimicking consciousness, and I am saying that it is not even a little bit
conscious. So, what else could consciousness be then?</p>



<p>My honest answer is: I don’t know. Will we
know someday? I also don’t know. Should it be possible, hypothetically, to
build a conscious artifact? Maybe, but I don’t know (but why not? I don’t know,
how then? I also don’t know). I wish I did know, but I don’t find it particularly
bizarre that certain things are still unexplained and unclear. It doesn’t mean
that there’s nothing interesting to be said on consciousness.</p>



<p>But in any case, I want to point out that the
“what else” argument is a self-destructive argument. Asking “what else?” is
just admitting that you have no logical argument that allows you to prove your
proposition. This is not an argument, but rather an admission of failure (which
is fine).</p>



<p>Anyway: I don’t know what it takes for
something to be conscious, but I think we can be fairly confident that LLMs or
deep networks are not conscious.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/north-atlantic-heat-record-sea-surface-temperature">Why is the North Atlantic breaking heat records?</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the past few weeks, sea-surface temperatures in some parts of the North Atlantic Ocean have soared to record heights.</p>



<p>The anomalous warming is occurring in a large swath stretching almost one-third of the way across the Atlantic westward from the northwestern coast of Africa. Satellite data reveal that some surface waters in the area are almost 4 degrees Celsius (about 7 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of the year, says Brian McNoldy, a meteorologist at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla.</p>





<p>“There’s been record-breaking warmth since March, but even more so now,” he says.</p>



<p>On June 10, for instance, the average sea-surface temperature for the portion of the Atlantic that stretches from the equator to 60 degrees north — up to southern Norway, southern Greenland and the central portions of Canada’s Hudson Bay — was 22.7° C (nearly 73° F). That’s about 1 degree C higher than the average recorded from 1991 through 2020, McNoldy notes. The previous record for the same date, 22.1° C, occurred in 2010.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hot Atlantic</h3>



<p>Sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic in 2023 (red) have been breaking daily records since March. In this plot, the 1982–2022 daily mean temperatures have been subtracted from this year’s temperatures as well of those from 1982 to 2022 (gray).</p>

<p>This year’s warmer-than-normal waters might help strengthen storms that form in the eastern Atlantic and eventually spawn hurricanes, scientists say.</p>



<p>What’s causing the unusual warm-up isn’t clear. But here’s a rundown of several factors that might be at play.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A dearth of Sahara dust</h4>



<p>Occasionally, vast swathes of desert dust from the Sahara waft across the ocean. They are carried by winds stirred up by a semipermanent high-pressure system dubbed the “Azores high” due to its proximity to those islands.</p>



<p>But lately, the Azores high has weakened and shifted southwest away from Africa. So those winds that typically pick up and transport Saharan dust westward over the North Atlantic are calmer and largely dust free, says Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>





<p>As a result, solar radiation that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-thermostat">normally would be scattered back into space by the dust</a> reaches the ocean surface, warming the dark waters (<em>SN: 9/25/01</em>).</p>



<p>If and when the trade winds strengthen, increased dust from Africa could help cool the area somewhat.</p>

This spring, a lack of dusty air has contributed to warming of the North Atlantic.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3128945">NOAA</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Decreased air pollution</h4>



<p>In 2020, new emissions rules kicked in for long-haul container ships that spew sulfate-rich exhaust plumes. There’s been some speculation that less pollution could lead to more heating. With fewer plumes scattering sunlight back into space, more radiation reaches the sea surface.</p>



<p>But some studies suggest that the cooling effect of ship plumes may have been minor to begin with: Not only do the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ship-tracks-exhaust-studies-overestimate-cooling-pollution-clouds">exhaust plumes have a short life span</a>, the pollutants can cause natural clouds to evaporate more quickly and thus lead to warming, not cooling (<em>SN: 2/1/21</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Global warming trends</h4>



<p>This year marks the return of El Niño, a climate phenomenon whose hallmark is warmer-than-normal sea-surface temperatures along the equator west of South America. By winter, there’s a more than 4 in 5 chance that the El Niño will be either strong or moderate, according to scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center.</p>



<p>Each El Niño <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fizzled-2014-el-nino-fired-ongoing-monster-el-nino">has its own personality</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/16</em>). But in general, El Niño boosts average surface temperatures both on land and at sea worldwide, Mann says. Human-caused climate change has done the same, he notes.</p>



<p>But there’s still a lot of uncertainty about how current conditions may affect the coming forecast.</p>



<p>The unusually warm waters of the North Atlantic may tend to strengthen storm systems that later develop into tropical depressions and then hurricanes. But the El Niño that’s now developing in the equatorial Pacific may hamper their formation by strengthening winds in the upper atmosphere that can shear the tops off nascent hurricanes. How active <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atlantic-hurricane-season-prediction">this year’s hurricane season</a> will be depends on which of these forces will prevail, scientists say (<em>SN: 5/26/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alternative splicing is well known to add a tremendous layer of complexity to eukaryotic transcriptomes, increasing exponentially the amount of information that can be stored in a single genomic region; this also offers opportunities for regulatory mechanisms. Traditional comparative transcriptomics is focused on the aim of assigning gene orthology across distantly related organisms, but transcriptome complexity driven by alternative splicing can make this task more and more challenging as genetic distance increases: intron density and distribution can vary by orders of magnitude across taxa. For this reason, focusing on orthologs does not explain the whole evolutionary history, may introduce bias, and can miss important variations throughout evolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this study, complexity metrics independent from orthology, developed with a transcriptome analysis software (TranD), are used to compare the dynamics of conditioning on orthologs versus whole-transcriptome complexity metrics. Instead of separately analysing single genes to estimate their evolutionary distance between species, this method treats whole-genome transcriptome splicing as a global phenotype that can shift across species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such an approach is able to mitigate bias issues and to capture genetic novelty more efficiently than ortholog-based approaches. It is also able to reveal higher degrees of complexity in taxa that were thought to be among the least complex. This represents a step forward in the emerging field of non-model evolutionary genomics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Training materials simulating clinically relevant scenarios are effective for medical teaching but require much organizational and financial effort. Virtual Reality (VR) technology promises to overcome such barriers and has shown significant educational value in some clinical domains, but its value for training Basic Life Support skills has still to be supported by evidence, especially considering its critical importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this study, the authors evaluated a VR immersive simulator designed for this purpose, considering its validity (is it an accurate representation of the real world training?) and fidelity (does it elicit realistic psycho-behavioral responses from trainees?), taken as major predictors of learning efficiency. Twenty-two medical trainees were asked to perform basic life support tasks on a VR mannequin in a VR environment, then on a real-world mannequin in a real-world setting. The researchers focused on whether behaviors such as self-reported feelings and perceptions or measured eye movement data, as well as performance parameters, were similar between the VR and real-world simulations on a person-by-person basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Results showed that the VR simulation passed the validity test: it was sufficiently immersive to make participants feel ‘present’ and they could properly perform procedural assessments. However, movement-based interactions indicated a limited fidelity, as participants displayed higher self-reported workloads, longer times to task completion, and disrupted attentional responses in the VR environment. This suggests that VR may be limited for improving visuomotor skills of Basic Life Support, but is potentially valuable for transferring perceptual and procedural abilities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Biostimulants are eco-friendly, non-toxic, biodegradable compounds that promote plant growth and enhance crop productivity, reducing disease risk and plant stress. One of the commonest biopolymers used as biostimulants for organic agriculture is chitosan, a component of fungal cell walls. Chitosan is known to stimulate plant growth, but is also able to elicit plant immunity through the activation of multiple defense-related mechanisms. Plant growth and immunity might become competitive upon chitosan treatment. What happens then to the growth-defense trade-off?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To answer that, researchers exposed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Calendula officinalis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> (marigold) to chitosan and measured an impressive number of parameters including the overall biomass, root and shoot growth, and the levels of several steroids and triterpenoids (responsible for plant growth and immunity, respectively). A general growth inhibition and decreased steroid levels were observed, similarly to what has been demonstrated in other models upon chitosan treatment or fungal infection. Chitosan elicitation had a variable effect on specialized triterpenoid metabolites, which may increase, decrease, or stay unchanged. Overall, the observed effects were different from expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These results indicate that chitosan treatment might not always result in enhanced plant growth and fitness: this is a reminder that agricultural solutions, including organic ones, are not universal and require accurate investigation before application. Life is always more complex than its representation and, as such, can always manage to surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clinical ethics consultations have always been widely debated, as there can be competing interests, differing moral values, and disagreement in any given encounter between a patient and an ethics consultant. With the advent of “open notes” in the clinical domain, free, real-time notes are available to patients through online portals, raising concerns about issues such as end-of-life care, autonomy, religious and cultural conflict, and confidentiality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The authors of this Review consider a narrative-based approach: whose story is being told through open notes? Shared notes can be reviewed and improved by patients, leading ethics committees to better understand their perspectives and map different viewpoints; however this can be time-consuming and not always action-guiding. The authors also focus on content: what should not be shared? There are indeed cases in which sharing would be unnecessary, or even harmful for the patient, so openness would not be recommended, thus undermining transparency and the feeling of trust. For sure, there are already aspects of all clinical encounters that regularly go undocumented… but is it really an issue? Is there a price to pay for openness? Is sharing always appropriate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, open notes complicate the documentation of clinical ethics consultations, but this comes with more transparency, relational trust building, and improved patient autonomy. Discussions on clinical ethics consultations are widespread, but interlinking that with the era of open notes is a fresh view on the topic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Circadian rhythms are intrinsic cyclical patterns of gene expression and metabolism that enable organisms to adapt to their changing environment, and are regulated by self-generated molecular clocks. In bacteria, the underlying mechanisms have been well characterized in cyanobacteria, but similar schemes have been recently reported in other microorganisms at the population level, especially in terms of composition and function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This Review guides readers through some of the most fascinating cases of microbial circadian clocks: from the classic example of cyanobacteria controlled by a three-component negative feedback loop based on cycles of protein sequestration and modification, to the viral-transmitted capacity to produce proteorhodopsin-mediated light-sensitive oscillations in the oceanic bacterioplankton, without forgetting the cyclical effects that, conversely, microorganisms can have on their environment, as in the case of gut microbiota impacting host metabolism in a circadian manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A comprehensive understanding of the multiple ways bacteria affect and are affected by environmental time patterns has yet to be achieved. There are many things that we do not know about how endogenous clock systems work across life domains, but it is only a matter of time before new, fascinating mechanisms are discovered.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-orbit-blazar">A supermassive black hole orbiting a bigger one revealed itself with a flash</a></h4>

              
                <p>A long-suspected black hole may have finally come out of hiding.</p>



<p>A monstrously massive black hole in a distant galaxy probably has a smaller companion that orbits it every 12 years. But that tiny partner has never been detected. Now, astronomers claim to have seen <a href="https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAS242/ViewSubmissionFile.aspx?sbmID=78&amp;mode=html&amp;validate=false&amp;key=1yfTp1QbH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a flash of light coming directly from the smaller black hole</a> for the first time.</p>



<p>“We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said astronomer Mauri Valtonen on June 7 at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Albuquerque.</p>





<p>Astronomers have been watching this object since the 1880s, when it showed up in a survey of asteroids as a brilliant point of light. That point of light, now dubbed OJ287, is a blazar. Among the brightest-looking objects in the universe, blazars are supermassive black holes that launch bright jets of radiation into space, and those jets happen to point almost directly at Earth. This one sits about 3.5 billion light-years away.</p>



<p>Sometimes, OJ287 shines even brighter than usual. For the past 40 years or so, astronomers have noticed that the object has a dramatic jump in brightness every 11 to 12 years.</p>



<p>In 1996, Valtonen and his colleague Harry Lehto, both of the University of Turku in Finland, suggested that the outbursts could be due to one supermassive black hole orbiting an even more massive black hole. Both black holes are probably behemoths, the astronomers calculated: The smaller is around 150 million times the mass of the sun, and the bigger is around 18 billion solar masses. For perspective, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">black hole in the center of the Milky Way</a> is about 4 million solar masses (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>).</p>



<p>The bigger black hole is thought to be surrounded by a disk of white-hot gas and dust, which glows at many wavelengths of light. If the smaller black hole exists, then every time it plunges through that disk, it would trigger a flash of light — thus explaining the recurring outbursts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This animation shows a flash of light that a smaller supermassive black hole in the blazar OJ287 emits when it crashes through the disk of gas and dust swirling around the other more massive black hole it orbits.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But until now, no light had been detected from the second black hole itself. Its presence was merely inferred from those regular flares.</p>



<p>Valtonen and his colleagues predicted that the most recent flare should arrive in January or February 2022 and arranged to monitor OJ287 every day using telescopes on Earth and in space. The team saw flares like the ones they had seen before, but there was a new flare that was different. It was bright and quick, fading after one night.</p>



<p>The team proposed that this flare came from a jet created by the smaller black hole pulling material out of the disk as it approached, before the collision.<a></a></p>



<p>“It swallows a whole lot of disk matter,” Valtonen said. “That matter falls into the secondary black hole, and you get a huge flare.”</p>



<p>Previous observations missed that flare because it is so short. The team almost missed it in 2022, due to bad weather. “We never observed OJ287 night to night to night [before], this was the first time,” he said. “That’s why we saw it.”</p>





<p>Some researchers have suggested other ways for a single black hole to give off the same pattern of light. If the team’s interpretation is correct, then it marks the first time the second black hole has been seen directly, Valtonen says.</p>



<p>“The detection of the second black hole should put an end to this discussion,” he says. “More generally, this could be the beginning of work on secondary jets in binary black hole systems, which could open up a new research field, now that we have at least one concrete example to study.” If other binary black holes make similar flashes as the smaller black hole crosses the larger one’s disk, astronomers now know how to look for them.</p>



<p>The observations do suggest the presence of a second black hole, says Caltech astronomer Seppo Laine, although other ideas are still possible.</p>



<p>“Mauri has been basically pushing this supermassive black hole binary model for decades now,” Laine says. “It doesn’t completely confirm it, but if this interpretation is correct, then it’s a significant step forward.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it may be difficult to test. The short flares come only once a decade, so astronomers need to be ready the next time. To resolve the two black holes directly, Valtonen says, might take a radio telescope in space.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/horses-humans-robots-technology">How understanding horses could inspire more trustworthy robots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Throughout history, cowboys have shared epic tales of horses that have taken them home on dark, foggy nights. Legendary horses have even carried wounded soldiers through battle zones.</p>



<p>Sensible and highly trained, these horses remind computer scientist and roboticist Eakta Jain of fully autonomous robots, specifically self-driving cars.</p>



<p>Vehicles today have different levels of autonomy, with level zero or one relating to an antilock braking system. Level two or three has adaptive cruise control, the ability to follow lanes or park. Such volition builds all the way to level five, which is full autonomy.</p>





<p>Those horses that take a rider home are level five, Jain says. “You trust them with your life.”</p>



<p>Interested in how that trust develops and if it could help improve human-robot interactions, Jain, of the University of Florida in Gainesville, immersed herself in the horse world during a year-long sabbatical that ended in 2022. Her experiences gave her a vast amount of information to address open questions about how humans should interact with robots of differing levels of autonomy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Only recently have researchers started focusing on the earliest stages of human-robot interaction, such as the creation of first impressions,&#8221; Jain and University of Florida colleague Christina Garner-McCune <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581245" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in the April <em>Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em></a>. &#8220;Our work seeks to uncover principles for the stage after the first meeting.”</p>



<p>During her sabbatical, Jain watched equine classes at her university, where she took notes based on her observations and conversations with students, teaching assistants and the instructor. She also spoke with other trainers and horse owners. And she learned to ride.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had never interacted with a horse before,&#8221; Jain says. &#8220;I was a new rider learning to interact with a horse who was not a new horse [to riding], but it was still the early stages of relationship building.&#8221;</p>



<p>When working with horses that are new to interacting with humans, the animals must learn how to interpret and appropriately respond as trainers do basic handling, such as leading and brushing them. This training helps ready horses for more advanced handling, such as accepting the saddle and bridle and carrying a human on their first few rides. New riders must learn the intricacies of how horse behavior communicates information and what cues horse handlers can use to direct horses to perform desired actions or correct the horse when it doesn&#8217;t behave as expected.</p>



<p>Analogously, people must learn how to command robots to perform specific tasks. They also must learn what to do when interactions with robots don&#8217;t go according to plan. Robots need to respond to inputs from humans in a predictable way. But more autonomous robots, like horses, must also dynamically respond to changing conditions, such as a self-driving car stopping to avoid hitting something, even when humans command it to continue forward.</p>



<p>In human-horse partnerships, horses primarily communicate nonvocally. For instance, their ears tend to point toward whatever they&#8217;re paying attention to. This behavior could inspire the creation of robots with electronic &#8220;ears&#8221; that can swivel in the direction of a ringing doorbell or people talking near an autonomous vehicle, thereby alerting humans to these sounds, Jain says. &#8220;Instead of the robot saying, &#8216;Knock on the door. Beep, beep,&#8217; if its ears were to point toward the door, it&#8217;s a much less jarring, much more subtle way of informing&#8221; people that the robot hears something it&#8217;s paying attention to.</p>



<p>Such subtleness could also be used as a sign of respect. Trainers and riders work with horses intensively to build respect. Horses nonvocally communicate their respect for their trainers and riders by matching their pace or giving them safe personal space when they walk. The horses&#8217; ears even point toward trainers as a show of respect when they&#8217;re paying attention to them. Trainers require that horses show signs of respect in basic interactions before &#8220;they will move on to the next, more complicated interaction,&#8221; Jain says. Respect can grow into trust. But, even with experienced horses and riders, trust is not a given.</p>



<p>There may be a similar limitation with robots. “Perhaps the same types of nonverbal expressiveness that&#8217;s used in the human-horse context can be used to communicate that the robot respects the human,&#8221; Jain says, which &#8220;might make humans feel safer around robots.

<p>Probing what it means for robots and humans to respect and trust each other is largely uncharted territory, Jain says. Understanding how respect and trust grow between horse and human could be a game-changer.</p>

<p>Hundreds of conference papers published by the U.S.-based <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers</a> (IEEE) show signs of plagiarism, citation fraud and other types of scientific misconduct, according to data sleuths.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am concerned that the issue with these particular conferences is widespread enough such that it indicates systemic issues with their peer review systems,&#8221; <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/">Kendra Albert</a> wrote last August in an email to IEEE that Retraction Watch has seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Albert is a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School and a lecturer in women, gender, and sexuality at Harvard University. On the side, Albert has been working with <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/">Guillaume Cabanac</a>, a professor of computer science at the University of Toulouse, in France, to ferret out research misconduct using a computer system called the <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1:::NO:::">Problematic Paper Screener</a>.</p>



<span id="more-127299"></span>



<p>The tool flags <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/19/tortured-phrases-lost-in-translation-sleuths-find-even-more-problems-at-journal-that-just-flagged-400-papers/">tortured phrases</a>, which suggest a publication&#8217;s authors have copied work from other researchers and tried to disguise the offense by using paraphrasing software that also renders scientific terminology near-unintelligible. &#8220;Breast cancer&#8221; might become &#8220;<a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/01/bosom-peril-is-not-breast-cancer-how-weird-computer-generated-phrases-help-researchers-find-scientific-publishing-fraud/">bosom peril</a>,&#8221; for instance, whereas &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; could turn into “counterfeit consciousness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;IEEE keeps publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:3::::RIR:IRC_PUBLISHER:IEEE">proceedings riddled with tortured papers</a>&nbsp;and other anomalies,&#8221; Cabanac told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The publisher said it believes its “preventive measures and efforts identify almost all papers submitted to us that do not meet our standards,” and told Retraction Watch that it is “currently evaluating the papers in question.”</p>



<p>IEEE has faced problems with peer review in the past, as we reported last year when <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/06/publisher-retracts-400-papers-at-once-for-violations-of-peer-review-process-policies/">it pulled 400 conference papers</a> at once. In previous years, IEEE has retracted <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.362.6413.393">thousands of papers</a>, accounting for <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?pub%3dIEEE%253a%2bInstitute%2bof%2bElectrical%2band%2bElectronics%2bEngineers">a sizeable chunk of the retractions in our database</a>.</p>



<p>In their email, Albert cited <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402320">a paper</a> in the <em>2021 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics </em>whose abstract begins: &#8220;Tumor growth is the real reason for death on the planet, furthermore, lung disease is the most every now and again observed sort of Tumor growth among others.&#8221;</p>



<p>The paper also contains tortured phrases – say, &#8220;arbitrary backwoods&#8221; instead of &#8220;<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm">random forest</a>&#8221; – as detailed in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/50DDBF8DC43A68C777DB3434301326">a PubPeer comment</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;This paper claims to be a survey of machine learning tools for detection of lung cancer, however, the abstract is incoherent, many of the citations are to irrelevant literature on epilepsy detection via EEG, and much of that literature is incorrectly summarized as being about lung cancer detection,&#8221; Albert wrote. &#8220;It is unclear to me how any reasonable peer review process would accept such an article.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article&#8217;s senior author, <a href="https://www.andhrauniversity.edu.in/college/college-of-engineering/engineering-departments/cse.html">K. Venkata Rao,</a> professor and head of the department of computer science and systems engineering at Andhra University in India, did not respond to requests for comment from Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>According to Albert:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Many other papers published in IEEE conference proceedings and flagged by the Problematic Paper Screener and reviewed by human assessors found </em><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F84436C345782643CCB1059BBC7027"><em>clear plagiarism</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4D7A2E37F710120D5FB2D36E1E218E"><em>signs of citation fraud</em></a><em>, or </em><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D59728BA838CF42FAE584DB9B62542"><em>errors of a type that should have been caught by an editing process</em></a><em>. Of note, few, if any, of the authors have responded to PubPeer inquiries about the irregularities in their papers.</em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">How so many suspicious papers could slip through peer review is unclear. But an interview with a university researcher familiar with the issue suggests one possible answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researcher, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal from his institution, said he recently submitted an article to a conference that is “technically sponsored” by IEEE and organized by his university (we are withholding the name of the conference to protect his identity); proceedings from such conferences are available for purchase from IEEE. When the researcher learned that a pair of colleagues would be reviewing his paper, he reported this conflict of interest to the conference chair. The chair, however, told him it was standard procedure to recruit reviewers from the host institution, which also supplied most of the papers for the conference, according to the researcher.</p>



<p>&#8220;What they do is to motivate all the faculty members and students to submit a low quality article which will be accepted through a fake peer review by a fellow colleague,&#8221; the researcher said in an email. &#8220;If the submitted articles in such events were reviewed independently by the international experts in the field no article can get accepted.&#8221;</p>



<p>Not only does this system provide a large number of ostensibly peer-reviewed publications for the host institution, it can also be exploited to ensure that the organizers&#8217; work is cited in the submitted papers, the researcher explained. He added that the &#8220;systematic misconduct&#8221; was &#8220;not limited to IEEE conferences,&#8221; and cautioned that not all of the publisher&#8217;s conferences are tainted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;There are numerous correct IEEE conferences with” acceptance rates of “only 30%,” the researcher said, “where the independent or external chairs handle peer reviews.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As a potential starting point for an investigation, Albert supplied IEEE with a list of 15 conferences whose proceedings contained up to 49 flagged articles each.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, not all papers flagged by the Problematic Paper Screener are indicative of scientific misconduct,&#8221; Albert wrote, &#8220;but the high numbers from these conferences, combined with the findings from our manual reviews suggests that this is likely to be a systemic problem rather than an isolated one.&#8221;</p>



<p>We reached out to the chairs of three conferences &#8212; the <em>2022 Fourth International Conference on Emerging Research in Electronics, Computer Science and Technology</em>, the <em>2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Systems</em>, and the <em>2022 5th International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Informatics</em> &#8212; whose proceedings have drawn <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0772F57BC6A8418C56A661D0D5A051">criticism</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DB12341A71942DF98D59EEBA867118">on</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/569CBBD9A1AEA3F46D14002E90498C">PubPeer</a>, but did not hear back.</p>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Monika M. Stickel, an IEEE spokesperson, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>IEEE continuously reviews and improves our processes to ensure that we detect articles that do not meet our standards and that are reported to IEEE. We believe our preventive measures and efforts identify almost all papers submitted to us that do not meet our standards, and we act accordingly when we are alerted to an error and take the appropriate level of care and time in our review. IEEE is currently evaluating the papers in question. Our policy for removing a paper or providing a label is contingent on the outcome of our evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, IEEE is still selling hundreds of suspicious papers on its website. The gibberish-laden article about lung-cancer detection, for example, can be purchased for $33.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/one-photon-photosynthesis-light">One photon is all it takes to kick off photosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>For photosynthesis, one photon is all it takes.</p>



<p>Only a single particle of light is required to<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06121-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spark the first steps</a> of the biological process that converts light into chemical energy, scientists report June 14 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>While scientists have long assumed that the reactions of photosynthesis begin upon the absorption of just one photon, that hadn’t yet been demonstrated, says physical chemist Graham Fleming, of the University of California, Berkeley. He and colleagues decided “we would just look to see was it really true that one photon was enough to start the whole thing off.”</p>





<p>The sunlight that falls on Earth’s surface seems brilliant to human eyes. But on small scales, that translates to a dribble of photons. Only a few tens of photons of the appropriate wavelengths of sunlight fall on a square nanometer per second, the scale of the tiny chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll molecules that are central to photosynthesis in plants and bacteria.</p>



<p>Many laboratory experiments on photosynthesis use lasers, much more powerful light sources, to kick off the reactions. Instead, Graham and colleagues used a source of light that produces just two photons at a time. One photon served as a herald, going off to a detector to let researchers know when two photons were released. The other photon went into a solution containing photon-absorbing structures from the photosynthetic bacterium <em>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</em>. These structures, called light-harvesting 2 complexes, or LH2, are made up of two rings of bacteriochlorophyll and other molecules.</p>



<p>In a normal photosynthesis reaction, LH2 absorbs a photon and passes its energy to another LH2 complex, and then another, like a game of hot potato. Eventually the energy reaches another type of ring, called the light-harvesting 1 complex, or LH1, which then passes it to the reaction center where the energy is finally converted into a form that the bacterium can use.</p>



<p>In the experiment, there was no LH1, so the LH2 instead emitted a photon of a different wavelength than the first, a sign that energy had been transferred from the first ring of LH2 to the second, a first step of photosynthesis. The researchers detected that second photon, and by comparing the detection times to those of the initial herald photons, confirmed that the LH2 needed to absorb only one photon to kick things off.</p>



<p>Plants and bacteria use different processes for photosynthesis, but the initial steps are similar enough that in plants, too, a single photon would set off the initial steps, Fleming says. However, in plants, multiple independently absorbed photons are needed in order to complete the reaction.</p>



<p>The role of single photons isn’t surprising, says biochemist Richard Cogdell of the University of Glasgow in Scotland. The important thing the researchers have done, he says, is to demonstrate the new technique. “By doing this you’re able to essentially interrogate what will be happening in nature,” he says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Some scientists suspect that photosynthesis <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/algae-use-quantum-trick-harvest-light">relies on quantum physics</a> (<em>SN: 2/3/10</em>). While it’s not clear whether the new technique could resolve the role of quantum effects, it could help scientists disentangle natural effects from artifacts of using intense sources of light in studies of photosynthesis.</p>



<p>“You can really work out what’s happening in the early reactions in photosynthesis as it were outside,” says Cogdell, “[as if] you could shrink yourself down and watch these photons moving around.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polyester-bees-brew-beer-scented-baby-food">‘Polyester bees’ brew beer-scented baby food in plastic cribs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Female <em>Ptiloglossa</em> bees are single moms with a lot to do and little time. Fortunately, they can use a feathery tongue to make infant-care plastics and then brew up batches of baby food.</p>



<p>“We jokingly call them polyester bees,” says pollination ecologist Stephen Buchmann of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>Chemically, the bee-made plastic is a cousin of human-made polyesters. A big gland on a female’s abdomen secretes Tinkertoy-like molecules of repeating lactone compounds, each with its “ester” structural bit that gives polyester its name.</p>

Inside each she starts a batch of fermenting pollen from <em>Solanum</em> nightshade flowers (middle), watery nectar from <em>Agave</em> (far left) and bacteria. The microbes add nutrition and a boozy fragrance.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125277">Bill Singleton</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The stuff makes the finishing touch for little urn-shaped nursery chambers that mother bees dig underground. They use their paintbrush tongues to lick up the gland secretion and slather it on nursery walls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plastic layer is transparent, tough and “can be kind of crunchy,” Buchmann says. It’s “thought to keep the brood chamber area nice and cozy, high-humidity and also to keep out the bad guys.”</p>





<p>These moms are doomsday preppers. In the <em>P. arizonensis</em> Buchmann studies in Arizona, females have only a few weeks to fill plastic retreats with all the food each youngster needs for much of a year underground before its own, brief reproductive frenzy in sunlight. Each generation of big, fast-flying bees grows up floating in, and feeding on, nothing but mom’s limited-edition brew of nectar and pollen — which smells like beer.</p>



<p>Many other bee species mix their baby food of pollen and nectar to “a kind of Play-Doh consistency,” Buchmann says. “Poke it and it dents.” Food stored in a cellophane bee nest, however, is different.</p>



<p>Open and tilt a nursery of baby <em>Ptiloglossa</em> bees “and all this stuff would run out it’s so watery,” Buchmann says. That’s probably because of the unusually watery nectar these polyester bees collect. Much of it comes from the candelabra-shaped bloom spikes of agave plants, runny enough for easy slurping by bats in southeastern Arizona and Sonora, Mexico.</p>



<p>To see what’s in the beer-scented brew, bee microbiome researcher Tobin Hammer of the University of California, Irvine, recruited Buchmann to collect several plastic-making <em>P. arizonensis</em> bees as well as relatives in the larger group called cellophane bees. Collecting the bees, their brood cells, food gatherings and source flowers took several years, mostly of waiting. Bees fly aboveground only a few weeks a year, and then for only about two hours around dawn.</p>



<p>“Quite shocking,” is Buchmann’s summary of what he found. Despite the beery smell of the food that <em>P. arizonensis </em>puts in the plastic vats, he says, “lo and behold, no yeast!”</p>



<p>These bees’ microbial fermenters didn’t evolve anywhere in the vast fungal kingdom. Instead, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10113673/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fermenters are mostly lactic acid bacteria</a>, Hammer, Buchmann and colleagues reported April 5 in <em>Frontiers in Microbiology.</em> The bees’ baby food glop is not yeasty beer but, Hammer says, closer to yogurt or sauerkraut.</p>

<p>Buchmann doubts that young bees take moms’ bacterial culture along when they leave home. Youngsters go through much of their early growth without pooping as far as bee science knows. Then they defecate “all at once,” Buchmann says. This clears the gut of the microbes, and the ejected wastes get separated from the youngster as it wraps itself in silk for its next stage of life. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The aboveground world that youngsters eventually join offers plenty of replacement bacteria. It flourishes in flowers — or “plant genitals,” as Buchmann calls them in his new book <em>What a Bee Knows</em>. Somehow the variety of microbes bees encounter gets winnowed down for baby food, lab analyses suggest. Just how is still an open question.<strong></strong></p>



<p>What the great coming-of-age poop does resolve for human sensibilities is the thought of how bee larvae without diapers can feed month after month on food they’re floating in.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781538709863" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the Blood</a><br><em>Charles Barber</em><br><em>Grand Central Publishing, $29</em></p>



<p>The average human body holds about 5 liters of blood. Lose a liter, and you may go into shock. Lose two more, and you’ll probably die.</p>



<p>For doctors treating traumatic injuries, keeping a patient’s blood in their body is “one of the most fundamental problems of survival,” <a href="https://charlesbarberwriting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Barber</a> writes in his fast-paced new book, <em>In the Blood</em>.</p>



<p>Solutions to that problem haven’t changed all that much in centuries. Doctors can pack a wound with gauze or put pressure on blood vessels to slow bleeding. While other areas of medicine have leaped ahead over time, Barber notes, emergency medicine has largely stood still, an inertia that’s had deadly consequences. Some 50,000 people in the United States bleed to death every year.</p>





<p>You’d think, then, that a product that can stanch bleeding would be celebrated in the streets, snapped up immediately by military doctors and emergency rooms alike. You’d be wrong. <em>In the Blood </em>chronicles the invention and bafflingly slow adoption of QuikClot and its successors, inexpensive clotting agents that can stop big bleeds in minutes. Barber, who’s also written about criminal justice and mental health, leads readers on the path from product invention to implementation — and it’s a treacherous journey.</p>



<p>Barber starts his story, which races like a thriller, in Mogadishu, Somalia, at the scene of the 1993 battle that inspired the movie <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. After two American helicopters were shot down, John Holcomb, then a U.S. Army major, and other doctors treated dozens of injured soldiers, many of whom died from loss of blood.</p>



<p>That horrific experience electrified Holcomb. Better hemorrhage control was urgently needed, and he was the man to lead the charge. In 2002, Holcomb became head of the Army Institute of Surgical Research, a research laboratory focused on improving combat casualty care. Holcomb championed the development of different clotting candidates, including HemCon, a bandage containing a shrimp-shell chemical, and Factor Seven, an injected drug that boosts the body’s clotting capability, sometimes lethally, it turned out.</p>



<p>In Barber’s telling of the story, Holcomb’s character is complex, shifting between savior and villain. Under his watch, the Army poured millions of dollars into his favorite products. It’s hard to grasp what motivated Holcomb, but Barber argues that he was long unwilling to consider other options — like QuikClot — data be damned. QuikClot seemed to be more effective than the rest. But it didn’t come with a big Army budget or a biotech company’s backing. It was born in an inventor’s basement.</p>



<p>The inventor was Frank Hursey, a mild-mannered engineer from Connecticut who discovered in 1983 that the ground-up mineral zeolite could mop up the water in blood. By concentrating the molecules involved in clotting, Hursey’s invention sped up the process. In 1999, he partnered with “swashbuckling salesman” Bart Gullong, who helped develop and promote the product. Barber pulls readers into their adventure, though he occasionally meanders too far into their backstories.</p>



<p>The action picks up when Barber digs into the evidence behind different clotting agents. He describes clear-cut animal tests, moving accounts from soldiers in the field and reports linking Factor Seven to stroke, heart attack and death. A central question of the book, then, is not so much “How do you stop a hemorrhage?” as “How do you get a hemorrhage-stopping product to the people who need it?”</p>



<p>Hursey and Gullong were up against entrenched military and pharmaceutical interests from the get-go. The company that produced Factor Seven aggressively marketed the drug, Barber reveals, even in the face of its flaws. It’s clear that he is rooting for the underdogs. He lays out facts for readers like a mason placing bricks, building a solid case against a system where money sways whether a medical product gets used. Even when the data suggest it shouldn’t.</p>



<p>In 2008, Holcomb finally recommended an improved version of Hursey’s invention, called QuikClot Combat Gauze, for use in the military, “an almost unimaginable victory,” Barber writes. In recent years, QuikClot gauze has made its way into hospitals, and consumers can now buy it on Amazon for $18.99. </p>



<p>Though Hursey remains largely unknown, Barber calls his discovery “paradigm-shifting.” Hursey “took bleeding control largely out of the hands of doctors,” Barber writes, “and put it into the hands of police officers, EMTs, adventurers, soldiers, hikers, and moms and dads.”</p>

<p>One of the first studies of long COVID has been retracted and replaced seven months after editors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/01/buzzy-lancet-long-covid-paper-under-investigation-for-data-errors/">marked it with an expression of concern</a> citing “data errors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original paper, “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32656-8/fulltext#section-3d6acba1-acea-4be2-8dc9-b7e14e5b6583">6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study</a>,” was published in <em>The Lancet</em> in January 2021. It was “the first large cohort study with 6-months’ follow-up” of people hospitalized with COVID-19, according to an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673621004463#bib1">editorial</a> published simultaneously, and has been cited more than 2,000 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. The World Health Organization, for example, <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/97337498/policy-documents">cited it</a> in several documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last November, the article <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02370-4/fulltext">received an expression of concern</a> stating that a researcher had contacted the journal about inconsistencies between that study and a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01755-4/fulltext">paper</a> published in August 2021, also in <em>The Lancet</em>, describing the same cohort of patients after one year of follow up.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127303"></span>



<p>“In view of the extent of these data errors,” the notice stated, the journal editors issued the expression of concern while they conducted a review of corrected data the paper’s authors had submitted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the expression of concern, the work was cited by some 400 other papers.</p>



<p>After their investigation, the editors decided to retract the article and replace it with a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00810-3/fulltext#%20">corrected version</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01175-3/fulltext">notice</a> about the action published June 9.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction and replacement notice describes the steps the journal editors took in their investigation, which involved statistical review of the data changes the authors requested, a clinician’s review of the differences between the 6-month and 1-year follow-up questionnaires, review of the Chinese versions of the questionnaires by <em>The Lancet</em>’s China editors, and asking the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, with which corresponding author Bin Cao is affiliated, to verify the corrected data. All aspects of the investigation turned out in favor of the authors. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given these results, we invited a resubmission with the corrected data, and organised formal peer review of the fully revised paper with the corrected data by all the previous clinical reviewers and the statistical reviewer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cao, who <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990488/">has been described</a> as “a leading researcher in pneumonia and influenza” who “has been instrumental in increasing knowledge about COVID-19,” did not immediately respond to our request for comment. [See update at end of post.]</p>



<p>Last year, <em>The Lancet</em>’s impact factor <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/28/the-lancet-more-than-doubles-its-impact-factor-eclipsing-nejm-for-the-first-time-ever/">surpassed</a> that of the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, long the top-ranked medical journal, in large part due to the papers it published about COVID-19, five of which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/">have been retracted</a>. One of those articles <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-controversial-hydroxychloroquine-study/">was retracted</a> after sleuths questioned whether its data were real, and the company that sourced the data, Surgisphere, would not produce it for review.</p>



<p>Update, 6/14/23, 0000 UTC: Cao tells us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I really appreciate the comments from a reader about data and symptom questionnaire inconsistencies between 6-month and 1-year outcomes in hospital survivors with COVID-19. The comments help us reanalysis of both database and find the errors at last. Though the changes did not make difference of the conclusions, I replied the reader with great appreciation and emailed editor of the Lancet. When The Lancet published an Expression of Concern on Nov 24, 2022, I got much pressure from media, because the media guess the Concern means retraction. But as a physician scientist, I understand thevalidity of data is more important. We followed the gudieline of the Lancet to re-peer review all the data and questionnaire, even though we did not know whether we could republish the paper or not. The re-peer review is a long journey for me.</p>



<p>Now the readers who are interested in Long COVID can read the&nbsp;confirmed and corrected data from 6-month consequeces of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital. This cohort is unique because these patiens are those infected with original SARS-CoV-2 stran at the beginning of the pandemic. My colleagues and I are following these patients now and try to answer the question of long covid.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-planets-rare-red-dwarf-stars">Jupiter-sized planets are very rare around the least massive stars</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’re looking to visit a gas giant planet in another solar system — or if you’re simply a science fiction writer who needs such a world for your story — you’d better steer clear of little red stars.</p>



<p>A search for planets <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd349" data-type="URL" data-id="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Jupiter around low-mass red dwarf stars</a> came up empty, researchers report in the July <em>Astronomical Journal</em>. “Around 200 stars, we did not detect a single one of these planets,” says Emily Pass, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>





<p>The find — or lack thereof — lends support to a theory of giant-planet building called core accretion. In this theory, gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn form by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-planet-newly-discovered-gas-dust-formation">gradually piecing together a solid core</a> out of debris orbiting a young star (<em>SN: 4/14/22</em>). That core eventually gets massive enough to attract lots of gas. But low-mass red dwarf stars shouldn’t host much solid material to begin with, so a paucity of gas giants is in line with that theory.</p>



<p>About three out of every four stars in the galaxy are red dwarfs, a type of star <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-cool-surface-temperature-failure-lasting-success">much fainter, cooler and smaller than the sun</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/21</em>). They glow dimly because they were born with little mass, about eight to 60 percent that of the sun. Previous planet searches have found that few red dwarfs have gas giant planets. But the new search targeted red dwarfs with only 10 to 30 percent of the sun’s mass, which are the most common such stars.</p>



<p>Pass and colleagues spent about six years searching for the Doppler shift an orbiting planet would cause in starlight as the world pulled its sun toward and away from us. All the observed stars are nearby, within 50 light-years of Earth. The closest is the well-studied Barnard’s Star, just six light-years away, which was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/other-worlds-other-planets">once thought to possess two Jupiter-sized planets</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>4/26/69</em>).</p>



<p>But no gas giants turned up around that star or any of the others. Extrapolating to the rest of the galaxy, the researchers conclude that fewer than two out of every 100 low-mass red dwarfs have planets as massive as Jupiter.</p>



<p>“To actually form a Jupiter [around the lowest-mass stars] is very hard,” says Edward Bryant, an astronomer at University College London, who was not one of the researchers conducting the search. “Their lack of a detection of a Jupiter analog I think is very consistent with the expectations from core accretion.” Because the disks of gas and dust around infant low-mass red dwarfs are small, there’s less material to create gas giants the size of Jupiter.</p>



<p>But smaller, rocky worlds stand a much better chance.</p>



<p>In fact, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acd175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many red dwarfs do have Earth-sized planets</a>, some at the right distances from their suns to sport pleasant temperatures. “We are talking about strange new worlds, not an Earth 2.0,” Pass says.</p>



<p>In our solar system, she says, Jupiter’s gravity may have prevented lots of ice from reaching Earth. As a result, our world didn’t end up completely underwater. In a planetary system lacking such a massive gas giant, an Earth-sized planet could turn into a water world that might still give rise to a highly intelligent species, but one that would live underwater — think dolphins — and not do any astronomy at all.</p>



<p>“It’s not saying that you can’t have life on these planets,” Pass says. “But those planets are just going to be so different than our own experiences.”</p>

<p>Camouflaging wheat seeds can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01127-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce seed loss</a> by more than 60 percent, scientists report May 22 in <em>Nature Sustainability. </em>All it takes is to make the whole field smell like wheat.</p>



<p>Rodents, including mice, are responsible for nibbling away at 70 million metric tons of cereals every year. Some of that munching takes place in Australia, where, when the weather is right, house mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) can reach plague proportions — skittering hordes of more than 1,000 mice per hectare, says Peter Banks, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sydney. There are so many mice on the road, he says, no one can avoid them. “It&#8217;s like driving on bubble wrap.”</p>





<p>When farmers plant wheat, mice go down the rows, sniffing out the seeds under the soil and digging them up. Usually, farmers overrun with mice turn to poisons such as zinc phosphide, which changes to phosphine gas in a mouse’s stomach. Unfortunately, it’s hard to make any poison appealing enough to make mice ignore the wheat buffet, and farmers are having to use more and more of it, says Steve Henry, a rodent ecologist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Canberra, Australia, who was not involved in the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What if the mice couldn’t sniff out the grains at all? Banks and his colleague Finn Parker, also a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sydney, have been working on olfactory camouflage — covering scents with, well, more scents. The technique started with invasive predators who hunt for threatened bird nests by smelling them out. “We thought, well, if we put those odors everywhere, how on Earth can they then find out where the nests actually are,” Banks says.</p>



<p>Banks, Parker and their colleagues had been using mice to study olfactory camouflage in the lab. When Banks saw a photo of the holes mice were digging into grain fields, “I thought, they&#8217;re finding those seeds by smell. And so can we use the same idea in that system?”</p>



<p>Before or during sowing, the scientists sprayed mouse-riddled test plots with wheat germ oil, a byproduct of wheat processing that is usually used in cosmetics and animal feed. The oils are the most nutritious parts, Banks says, and the smell of the oils is “what [the mice] are using to find the seeds beneath the ground.”</p>

Each hole here is a stolen wheat seed that a mouse sniffed and dug out of the soil.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3125097">Peter Banks</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Two weeks after the seeds had been sown, plots that had been hosed down with oil before sowing had 74 percent fewer mouse holes—from an average of around 125 holes per plot to fewer than 30. Plots that got the oil during sowing had 63 percent fewer holes — from around 125 to fewer than 40 stolen seeds. When the plots got oil before sowing, Parker says, the mice “were coming, they&#8217;re seeking food, and they were just finding nothing.” In that case when the seeds went into the ground, the mice may have already learned not to bother with that plot. When the oil was delivered during sowing, it became harder for the animals to find the wheat seeds they were seeking.</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s one of the most elegant parts of it,” Henry says. “Saturating the area with the smell of wheat.” The challenge, he notes, will be getting farmers to adopt it. The test was done on a 27-hectare wheat crop, but farmers in Australia are often planting 6,000 hectares or more. They’d need a way to apply the wheat germ oil at the time of planting, when they already have a lot to manage.</p>



<p>And the camouflage probably won’t be enough on its own, Henry says. “I don&#8217;t see it as replacing bait, but I see this another tool in the shed that will really help.”</p>

<p>The sheriff of Franklin County, Ohio, has received an order to seize and sell property of Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University in Columbus, to pay his nearly $1.1 million debt to lawyers who represented him in failed libel and defamation suits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last December, a judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/09/judge-orders-osu-cancer-researcher-to-pay-1-million-to-lawyers-from-failed-libel-suit/">ordered Croce to pay $1,098,642.80</a>, plus interest, to <a href="https://www.keglerbrown.com/">Kegler Brown Hill &amp; Ritter</a>, which was one of the firms that represented him in his <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/19/osu-cancer-researcher-carlo-croce-loses-appeal-of-new-york-times-libel-suit/">libel lawsuit</a> against the <em>New York Times</em> and his <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/13/cancer-researcher-loses-defamation-suit-against-critic/">defamation case</a> against David Sanders, a researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He lost both cases, and the firm <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/26/law-firm-sues-osu-cancer-researcher-for-900000-in-unpaid-fees-following-failed-libel-suit/">sued him</a> for $900,000 in unpaid fees. Croce also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/12/18/embattled-cancer-researcher-loses-legal-bid-to-be-reinstated-as-department-chair-at-osu/">lost a suit</a> against Ohio State in which he sought to regain his post as chair of his department after the university removed him. </p>



<span id="more-127297"></span>



<p>Croce’s <a href="https://fcdcfcjs.co.franklin.oh.us/CaseInformationOnline/caseSearch?ReOlVBGXxHM46lu2Uk2X">appeal of the December judgment</a> is still in process, but in January the court <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/another-denial.pdf">denied</a> his request for a temporary stay of execution, meaning garnishment and other enforcement of the judgment can continue unless Croce can provide a surety bond or letter of credit for the full amount of the judgment, plus 18 months worth of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Croce and his current lawyer, Andrew Mills Holford of Johrendt &amp; Holford, and Maria M. Guthrie of Kegler Brown, who was representing the firm in its case against the researcher, did not immediately respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the judgment was issued, the court garnished Croce’s bank accounts, and Ohio State has been garnishing his wages since March by about <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230606-garnishment.pdf">$15,600 each month</a>, or about 25% of his paycheck. As we have previously reported, Croce earns <a href="https://apps.hr.osu.edu/salaries/Home/Salaries?Firstname=carlo&amp;Lastname=croce&amp;Funding=University&amp;WhichSource=Salaries&amp;Year=0&amp;IsValid=True">more than $800,000</a> per year at OSU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 12, the state of Ohio issued a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230512-writ-of-execution.pdf">writ of execution</a> to the sheriff of Franklin County, in which Columbus is located, ordering that Croce’s “goods and chattels” be sold to pay his debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The court’s records include an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230508-artwork-exhibit.pdf">itemized list</a> of Croce’s extensive artwork collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On June 2, Croce filed a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/230602-request-for-hearing.pdf">request for a hearing</a> that stated “I believe that some or all of my property may be exempt from execution in the above case.”</p>



<p>We count <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCroce%252c%2bCarlo%2bM">14 retractions</a> for Croce, as well as many corrections and expressions of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another firm that represented Croce is also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/arnold-v-croce.pdf">suing him for unpaid legal fees</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference </a> (fast forward to minute 31) and have been lightly edited for length and format. This is the second of four blogs on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change.<br><br>One of the main reasons why I joined PLOS more than five years ago was its founding principle:&nbsp; An organization established by practicing scientists and dedicated to transforming science communication. We believe it&rsquo;s necessary to fundamentally rethink how we share and consume research based on two key principles:</p>



<ul><li>First, we must continue to move beyond the constraints of the physical format and take advantage of the opportunities provided by the digital world.</li><li>Beyond technology, we must upend archaic systems of funding, reward, and recognition, to honor values like collaboration,<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/"> inclusion</a>, and transparency.</li></ul>



<p>I&rsquo;m proud to say that PLOS is one of the earliest pioneers in the Open Science publishing space. When we started 23 years ago, as a non-profit, with the mission of accelerating progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication, many in our industry thought we wouldn&rsquo;t survive. As you can tell, we are alive and well, and thriving.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://plos.org/about/">Over the 20 years since our first journal launch</a> we&rsquo;ve helped prove the viability of Open Access. Despite the evolving conversation about how best to achieve it, it&rsquo;s now mainstream.</li><li>We changed the publishing landscape with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information"><em>PLOS ONE,</em></a> enabling all rigorous, peer-reviewed research to be published and discoverable.</li><li>We helped focus the conversation about peer review on <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">rigor and transparency</a>. More people now understand how impact-seeking should never be at the expense of these notions.</li><li>Via a wide range of solutions, we&rsquo;ve worked towards <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">Open Science</a> at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the entire research communication process.</li></ul>



<p>More recently, we&rsquo;ve expanded our portfolio with titles focused on critical challenges outlined in the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>, and signed the UN SDG Publisher&rsquo;s Compact. Our intention is to create new and diverse communities of practice, who will, in turn, shape how we address the most pressing health and environmental issues facing our society. </p>



<p>My optimism is also fueled by the range of more radical start-ups entering this space, like <a href="https://www.arcadiascience.com/">Arcadia Science</a>, a new research organization building open science principles into their foundations<strong>,</strong> including reimagining the publishing process from the ground up.</p>



<p><strong>What PLOS Is Doing</strong></p>



<p>Like Arcadia, we have never been driven by tradition<strong>, </strong>but by a willingness to question the status quo and an eagerness to explore how we can improve the system. First, we&rsquo;ve delivered change by embracing progressive improvements to science communication while maintaining its core principles such as transparency, inclusion, and collaboration.</p>



<p>Some of this is about technology. Sadly, the publishing industry has largely digitized existing processes without attempting to imagine alternative solutions. Put simply, most of the industry is still print-first even when there is no print output.</p>



<p>Capturing the potential of digital technologies was fundamental to the vision of PLOS&rsquo; founders. And we&rsquo;ve done that. Fast forward 20 years into the era of big data. Science can now address complex research questions in unprecedented ways. But this requires access to and publication of all supporting data as a norm.</p>



<p>We were the first publisher to introduce a <a href="https://everyone.plos.org/2014/02/24/plos-new-data-policy-public-access-data-2/">data sharing requirement</a> back in 2014 &ndash; and yes, it had its detractorsin the early days. But the policy has been tremendously successful and hasn&rsquo;t encountered the negative consequences that many predicted. It also demonstrated the value of sharing data and gave researchers another way of demonstrating their impact. The sheer scale of introducing a change like this in a journal the size of <em>PLOS ONE</em> has also helped to normalize the sharing of data. We&rsquo;ve built on this with other progressive, values-driven solutions.</p>



<p>PLOS journals have always welcomed submissions with associated preprints, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 2016 that we formalized our support in journal policy and began <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/">accepting incoming direct transfers from bioRxiv</a>. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/02/plos-cold-spring-harbor-preprint-agreement-biorxiv/">In 2018, we expanded that partnership and made it a 2-way street</a>. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">Authors</a> could now have their manuscripts forwarded to bioRxiv as part of the PLOS submission process, instead of two separate submissions. Since then, we&rsquo;ve launched similar partnerships with other preprint servers, like <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/expanding-medrxiv-at-plos/">medRxiv</a> and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">earthRxiv</a>. By simplifying the process, we&rsquo;ve seen consistent growth in preprint posting over time.</p>



<p><strong>Code and Methods Sharing</strong></p>



<p>A second example sought to address one of the key barriers to reproducibility: the poor reporting and sharing of methods. PLOS partnered with <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> in 2017 to <em>encourage</em> sharing of reusable step-by-step protocols on the platform. But fewer than 1% of authors used this option. So, we sought to better understand why through interviews with researchers about their needs. Most importantly, we learned that expert feedback on protocols is important, as is wide accessibility. But it was also important to be able to receive credit for methods development, and to be able to version and modify protocols.</p>



<p>And so we went back to the drawing board to develop a new product, <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/">peer reviewed Lab Protocols.</a><strong> </strong>These combine a dynamic protocol in an easy-to-follow format with a peer-reviewed and published article.</p>



<p>One of the key overarching lessons from our work to date is that we&rsquo;re often dealing with challenges that are not, at heart, technological in nature.</p>



<p>One concrete example. Our internal research shows that scientists are happy with the options available to them to share their data. Yet most of them don&rsquo;t share data&ndash; the solution here is clearly not simply to build another system. The process of sharing is messy and takes time. Sometimes scientists don&rsquo;t know how. And we&rsquo;ve already learned that if there&rsquo;s no reward, busy scientists aren&rsquo;t going to invest the time.</p>



<p>Over the past 5 years we&rsquo;ve focused heavily on how to invite behavioral changes through our publishing process. Our thinking at PLOS has been informed by the classic diffusion theory of innovation, developed by E.M. Rogers in 1962. Essentially, this theory states that adoption of new ideas, behaviors and products doesn&rsquo;t happen simultaneously<strong>.</strong> Some individuals are more open to adaptation than others.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re using this to inform a portfolio approach, focusing on innovators and early adopters for newer ideas and opportunities. But if change is truly to happen, we also need to be thinking about how to bring along those who are more skeptical of change<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>For these groups, offering new features in our journals<strong> &ndash;</strong> a format they&rsquo;re comfortable with &ndash; is likely to be more successful. One fairly recent example here is our experiment with code sharing in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/"><em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></a>. As Jason Papin, co-editor in chief, put it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Code is the life-blood of research in our field. In order to truly build on the discoveries and advances in computational biology, we must be able to build on the work of others</p></blockquote>



<p>When we spoke to researchers in the field, we heard that sharing code <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800">signals confidence and integrity</a> on the part of the authors, which in turn supports trust in the community<strong>.</strong> And that they are ready and willing to open doors for fellow researchersby enabling them to more easily reuse or adapt scripts for their own studies, helping the whole field to advance more quickly.</p>



<p>Our team saw an opportunity to shift behavior by piloting a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">new journal policy<strong>.</strong></a> It would require authors to make public any code directly related to the results of their article upon publication. The proof of the experiment&rsquo;s success? In 2019 &ndash; before the policy was introduced &ndash; the rate of code sharing for articles in the journal was 53%. Not too bad, you might think &ndash; but looking at articles published after the policy was introduced, that number jumped to 87%. That was enough for us to make it a permanent policy. We&rsquo;re now focusing on code quality and reproducibility<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Behavioral Change</strong></p>



<p>Another model we&rsquo;re using at PLOS that influences how we approach behavioral change is one you may be familiar with. It&rsquo;s a comprehensive strategy developed <a href="https://www.cos.io/about/board#:~:text=Brian%20Nosek%20is%20Co%2Dfounder,at%20the%20University%20of%20Virginia.">by Brian Nosek, Executive Director of the Center for Open Science</a>, to help us understand the process of culture change and how we can accelerate it. The model helps us think about what&rsquo;s necessary at each level. For example, the Center for Open Science has done a lot to tackle the level of infrastructure through development of their <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> &ndash; a free, open-source application to support research workflows.</p>



<p>A wide variety of Open Access and data-sharing mandates from funders are driving a great deal of top-down change at the policy level. We&rsquo;re making notable headway at PLOS with the next level, &ldquo;making it easy&rdquo;, with much of the work I&rsquo;ve just described.</p>



<p>Other like-minded publishers are pushing on different parts of the problem. eLife recently announced that it will become &ldquo;a service that reviews preprints&rdquo;, getting rid of the standard &ldquo;accept or reject&rdquo; decision after review. This not only has the potential to begin decoupling peer review and publication, but also to speed up sharing of critical research. And it puts authors in charge of their journey.</p>



<p>Focusing on key decision points in the existing reward system such as this can have meaningful impacts. Over time, by nudging different elements of the publications system, we&rsquo;re moving closer to a system based on transparency and reproducibility.</p>



<p>Creating easier paths to Open Science practices is only one part of the equation. Next week, I&rsquo;ll talk about how institutional business models can also affect change at scale.</p>
