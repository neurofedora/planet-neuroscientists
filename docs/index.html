                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png"><img decoding="async" width="171" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130050"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kaikobad Irani</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A cardiology researcher who left the University of Iowa with a six-figure <a href="https://settlements.regents.iastate.edu/uploads/d/b/3/db3e65406066a177970e559957526d3d75fb4e3f/K.-Irani-Settlement-Agreement.pdf">settlement</a> earlier this year won’t be starting the new job he’d lined up at the Providence VA Medical Center, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Justyn Charon, a spokesperson for the Providence VA, previously told us the researcher, Kaikobad Irani, would begin his new position “around November.” When we followed up, Charon confirmed, “there is currently no plan for Dr. Irani to be employed by VA Providence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, the University of Iowa in Iowa City has launched an investigation about the leak of a report regarding Irani to Retraction Watch that appears to be an attempt to identify the source of the document.</p>



<span id="more-130530"></span>



<p>As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/19/exclusive-providence-va-hires-scientist-previous-employer-found-had-harassed-mentees/">previously reported</a>, administrators at the institution investigated allegations Irani had harassed mentees. That inquiry found, based on a “preponderance of evidence,” Irani had violated the university’s policies on harassment, professional conduct, and use of information technology resources, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our request for comment on why he would no longer work at the Providence VA, Irani said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>My VA employment was targeted using an illegally leaked and misleading investigation report into fabricated allegations of harassment. The allegations were made by persons who worked in my lab who I had in good-faith previously reported for serious violations of research integrity. The investigation did not verify the allegations made by those I had reported. After considering the totality of evidence and lack of evidence, University of Iowa authorities did not find I violated its anti-harassment policy. The narrative that my &#8220;previous employer found [I] had harassed mentees&#8221; and that my &#8220;behavior violated university&#8217;s policy on harassment&#8221; (see Retraction Watch Sept 19, 2024) is false.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Irani, who claims that the University of Iowa provost did not uphold the findings of the investigation, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Retraction-Watch-Statement-2024.09.17.pdf">previously told us</a> he had “faced a campaign of retaliation” for reporting one colleague for research misconduct and others for failing to disclose conflicts of interest on grant applications to the National Institutes of Health. The findings of the investigation “are largely based on false unsubstantiated allegations made by persons whom I had earlier reported in good faith,” he said when we contacted him for our earlier story. At that time, he did not dispute the investigation had found he had violated the university’s harassment policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After publication of our story on the investigation report, Julian West, an investigator in the Office of Civil Rights Compliance at the University of Iowa, and Todd Rent, the university’s senior director of employee and labor relations, contacted us with questions about the document we had obtained, such as how many pages long it was, and whether and how it was redacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rent said their goal was not to identify our source, but to “determine whether our university&#8217;s existing document control procedures are sufficient to maintain an environment where campus community members feel safe raising concerns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid providing information that could identify our source, we declined to answer their questions. They, and the University of Iowa media relations office, did not respond to our request for comment on their investigation into our source for the document.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png"><img decoding="async" width="720" height="900" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130527" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png 720w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Richard Addante</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On November 12, Richard Addante, an associate editor at the journal <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>, received an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Email-from-Wei-Yang.pdf">alarming email</a> from someone purporting to be a faculty member at a university in China. </p>



<p>“I have a lot of papers to publish, papers on computers, medicine, materials, and so on,” the email, signed by a “Wei Yang” of Zhengzhou College of Business and Industry, stated. “If you can help me publish my paper, I&#8217;ll pay you $1500 as a referral fee.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To Addante, <a href="https://news.fit.edu/experts-profile/?username=richardj.addantephd">a psychologist at Florida Institute of Technology</a>, in Melbourne, the message suggested the field of scientific publishing needed a thorough clean-up.</p>



<span id="more-130526"></span>



<p>“It was surprising to see such an obvious request for bribery, and the brazen nature of it led me to think that it may be a common practice for some, for which there was apparently no fear of repercussion,” Addante told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A joint investigation by <em>Science</em> and Retraction Watch earlier this year found paper mills in China and elsewhere have been <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">bribing editors</a> and planting agents on editorial boards for years.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.342.6162.1035">long-known hotbed for paper mills</a>, China has recently taken <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00397-x">steps to curtail academic fraud</a>. But observers say it remains <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-government-cracks-down-on-academic-fraud/7523009.html">business as usual</a> there. “China&#8217;s scientific research evaluation system has not changed, and corruption in the system that may affect integrity has further increased,” said a sleuth in China, who tracks paper mills and requested anonymity for fear of retaliation by the government.</p>



<p>Addante alerted Frontiers to the bribery attempt, and also withdrew from editing a paper by researchers he believed were from the same school as the person who had emailed him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you have people offering bribes from one institution, it casts a gray cloud on everyone from that institution,” Addante said.</p>



<p>Other editors in the United States and Europe have also received bribery proposals from the same Chinese email account in recent weeks. On their LinkedIn pages, two university professors – one an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fmenczer_journal-editors-please-add-individual-below-activity-7263657345715437568-QQgw/">editorial board member at <em>PeerJ Computer Science</em></a> and another <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valeria-cavioni_academia-integrity-frontiers-activity-7262546970022400002-4seh/">an associate editor at <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> – shared screenshots of emails similar to the one Addante received.</p>



<p>“Increasingly, academic journal editors are receiving payment offers to expedite the publication process,” Valeria Cavioni of Università Mercatorum in Rome <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valeria-cavioni_academia-integrity-frontiers-activity-7262546970022400002-4seh/">wrote in her post</a>.</p>



<p>But the Chinese emails contain a red flag: They appear to come from the domain of <a href="https://www.ztbu.edu.cn/">Zhengzhou Technology and Business University</a>, a private school in China’s Henan province, although the signature at the bottom stated Yang was an associate professor at the School of Information Engineering at Zhengzhou College of Business and Industry. A Google search found no institution by that name. Similarly, a search for “Wei Yang” and “Zhengzhou Technology and Business University” came up empty.</p>



<p>An email we sent to the account at Zhengzhou Technology and Business University bounced, with a message stating the recipient didn’t exist. We also called the number in the signature, but it was not in service. When we called the School of Information Engineering at Zhengzhou Technology and Business University, we were told no one by the name “Wei Yang” worked there.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, internal emails we obtained show Frontiers is taking the emails seriously and has escalated the case to its research-integrity team. In one message from December 6, Sara Palermo, assistant specialty chief editor for neuropsychology at the publisher, wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I proceeded to make reports regarding these communications in recent weeks to the Editorial Offices. Corruption attempts are underway by several researchers based in China.</p>



<p>The journal Manager and the Executives are carrying out checks and flagging all the authors. Likewise, attempts will be made to dissuade AEs [associate editors] from accepting similar proposals.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an emailed statement, the publisher told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Frontiers has no control over unscrupulous third parties who contact our editorial boards with unethical schemes. Any bribery attempts are clearly counter to all Frontiers&#8217; research integrity policies and ethics. Our editors have the good sense to forward these messages to our attention and to ignore them. We are actively investigating, and in line with our investigation policies will contact the individual(s) and the institution(s) they claim affiliation with.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Addante acknowledged the Chinese email might not be what it seemed. “It could just be a phishing thing to get my bank account,” he said. “I mean, professors are famously naive and susceptible to stupidity.”</p>



<p>He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Whether it’s fraud upon the scientific integrity of the review process and bribery, or whether it&#8217;s just preying upon vulnerable faculty to give their bank account numbers – either way, it&#8217;s fraud, and it&#8217;s fraud within the industry of science.</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="104" height="150" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130521"/></a></figure></div>


<p>A journal formerly published by Hindawi has yet to publish any sort of notice on a paper sleuths reported for containing duplicated images 1.5 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Kevin Patrick, the sleuth who contacted the publisher in mid-2023, the episode “might be a useful case study” of the issues facing Wiley, which acquired Hindawi in 2021 and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/06/wiley-to-stop-using-hindawi-name-amid-18-million-revenue-decline/">stopped using the brand name</a> earlier this year after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">retracting thousands of papers</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">closing journals</a> overrun by paper mills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8840692">Resveratrol Derivative, Trans-3, 5, 4 ′-Trimethoxystilbene Sensitizes Osteosarcoma Cells to Apoptosis via ROS-Induced Caspases Activation</a>,” appeared in <em>Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</em> in 2021. Clarivate <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">removed the journal</a> from its Web of Science index in March 2023 for failing to meet quality criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April 2023, Elisabeth Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4B54C4603D17F0D264C1C82E95BA24#1">left a comment</a> on PubPeer, noting “several figures in this paper look identical to figures in a 2019 paper by some of the same authors,” which had been retracted. “I could not find wording about e.g. a republication of part of that study, and the 2019 paper is not included in the references,” she wrote.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130520"></span>



<p>Ming Hong, the 2021 paper’s last author, with an affiliation listed at Guangzhou University &amp; Zhongshan People’s Hospital Joint Biomedical Institute, in China, responded soon after. Hong said a student had used the data and published the manuscript in the other journal, and the team had retracted the paper when they found out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Bik asked how Hong’s name could have been on the earlier paper without Hong knowing about it, Hong replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I have not received any notice when the paper on cells was submitted. When I found it is [sic] published, I immediately retracted the paper. I am so sorry for this paper on cells. We will pay much more attention on [sic] these things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At that point, Patrick added a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4B54C4603D17F0D264C1C82E95BA24#5">comment</a> about images in the paper “seemingly derived from a paper published by different authors in Scientific Reports where they are described differently.” Hong did not respond to that concern.</p>



<p>Patrick sent the PubPeer thread to Wiley’s research integrity email inbox on April 27, 2023. A few days later, a research integrity specialist for Hindawi replied: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for bringing these concerns to our attention. Please be assured that they will be fully investigated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will be in contact with you on the outcome of these investigations, or should further action be required.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Oct. 31, 2024, Patrick asked for update on the case. He received the following email in reply:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Due to a high volume of emails, the Research Integrity team is unfortunately experiencing slightly longer than usual response times. Please be assured that these concerns are being investigated and we will be in contact with you as soon as we have a further update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you again for your patience and understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response to our inquiry, a Wiley spokesperson said the publisher “expect[s] the case in question to be resolved soon.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wiley takes research integrity very seriously,” the spokesperson said. “The complexity and scale of research integrity concerns have increased vastly across publishers over the last few years, and Wiley has responded by both expanding the number of in-house research integrity experts and investing in new technological tools.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Wiley “has been aware of multiple serious problems in this paper” for more than 18 months, Patrick said, the publisher has not marked it with an expression of concern or any other indication of the ongoing investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That they do not act with a sense of urgency on these matters, and don&#8217;t seem to care that their readers might be depending upon a flawed paper, bothers me,” Patrick said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I also do not have any sympathy for the ‘high volume of emails’ leading to ‘slightly longer than usual response times.’ If a publisher is spitting out papers at a rate so fast that they cannot fix problems in papers as they are brought to their attention &#8211; by volunteers &#8211; they have admitted that they don&#8217;t care about the content in their publications or their readers.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on Tuesday, December 10.</p>



<p>PLOS has been awarded a $3.3million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, underscoring its commitment to pioneer a shift away from traditional publishing models. The 3-year funding package from the Gates Foundation will support PLOS&rsquo; transition towards APC-free publishing by enabling authors, funded by the foundation, to publish with PLOS without facing APC barriers, and to contribute to open access publishing options for authors who do not have access to funding. This 3-year grant offers support while PLOS is actively working on new publishing models grounded in open science starting with an ongoing <a href="https://plos.org/redefining-publishing/">research &amp; design project</a>.</p>



<p>The grant will also support improvements to enhance the capture and dissemination of funding metadata and to experiment with the posting of peer reviews alongside preprints during the evaluation process, promoting greater transparency in scholarly communication.</p>



<p>The transition away from APCs is not a new concept for PLOS, which has been actively developing alternative business models since 2020 with the express aim of reducing financial barriers in scholarly publishing and fostering open access for a broader range of researchers. PLOS has been a vocal champion regarding the benefits of preprints for the <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">early sharing of research </a>&nbsp;and has significant partnerships with bioRxiv, medRxiv and earthRxiv.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of APC-free, open science-based publishing models and inspire a transformative shift across the scholarly communication landscape,&rdquo; said Niamh O&rsquo; Connor, Chief Publishing Officer at PLOS. &ldquo;We are grateful for the foundation&rsquo;s funding support as we explore ways to transition publishing services away from &lsquo;per published unit&rsquo; based pricing and incentivize sharing the form of output most appropriate to the research.&rdquo;<br></p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://scholar.google.bg/citations?user=TpJ45YkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Milen Zamfirov</a>, dean of the faculty of educational sciences at Sofia University in Bulgaria, was named an exceptional scientist in the social sciences and humanities. As part of the accolades at the prestigious <a href="https://www.bta.bg/en/news/bulgaria/672653-pythagoras-science-awards-presented-in-sofia">Pythagoras Science Awards</a> from the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science, Zamfirov received a commemorative plaque, diploma, and a cash prize of 8,000 BGN (US $4,300).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, he is accused of plagiarising past research in a paper he co-authored with <a href="https://shtastie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CV_MBakrachevaEN.pdf">Margarita Bakracheva</a>, who received a certificate of excellence from the Union of the Bulgarian Scientists earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://fnoi.uni-sofia.bg/EN/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4.-MARGARITA-BAKRACHEVA.pdf">Their study</a>, titled, “In Search of Integrativity of Sciences: the Principle of Supplementarity in the Story of Pauli and Jung,” was published in Bulgarian in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the paper seems to have significant overlap with other sources, according to Irene Glendinning, a researcher and consultant based in Leicester, UK.</p>



<span id="more-130514"></span>



<p>“I don’t think there is any doubt that this is plagiarism,” said Glendinning, who <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276864042_Impact_of_Policies_for_Plagiarism_in_Higher_Education_Across_Europe_Results_of_the_Project">has studied plagiarism policies</a> at higher education policies across the European Union. “In this case, together with the ridiculous mistakes in the narrative, I guess they knew it was wrong, but thought it was worth the risk because their paper was in Bulgarian and they thought it unlikely anyone would notice or care.”</p>



<p>Two previous English-language papers that the 2021 paper has overlap with are a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01822/full">2015 <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> study</a> and a paper published by the <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs"><em>Journal of Consciousness Studies</em></a> in 2012.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zamfirov did not reply to a request for comment. Bakracheva told <em>Retraction Watch </em>in an email that her study was a theoretical review of the “very few studies highlighting Jung-Pauli collaboration and common approach in different sciences, in this case physics and psychology.”</p>



<p>As for the text overlap and similarities between figures, Bakracheva said past literature is “correctly referenced” at the end of each paragraph. “Since it is explicitly stated that the aim of the article is to give a brief example of a possible historical illustration of the cooperation and integration of different scientific fields, there is no demarcation between the referenced sources and the ‘personal thoughts’.”</p>



<p>However, Jerome Busemeyer, a psychologist and brain sciences researcher at Indiana University Bloomington who co-authored the paper in <em>Frontiers in Psychology </em>study, was not convinced. “I think the work should be retracted or rejected,” he said. “There are proper ways to refer and make use of others’ work by properly acknowledging and getting permissions.” </p>



<p>As a “minor defence,” Glendinning said  some academics “think it is OK to paraphrase or directly copy material as long as a reference to the original is given somewhere in the paper. No real excuse in this case, but I’ve come across this quite a lot in different countries.”</p>

<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> has retracted a paper by a former group at Harvard following a postdoc’s allegations the work contained manipulated data.</p>



<p>The retracted paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1009557"><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>–induced nociceptor activation increases susceptibility to infection</a>,” appeared in 2021 from the lab of Mihaela Gadjeva, an immunologist previously based at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. It has been cited 22 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Gadjeva had been employed at Brigham and Women’s hospital for 16 years until her departure at some point in 2022. Since then, she has been an associate director of bacteriology at Moderna.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130511"></span>



<p>The retraction comes after a former postdoc in Gadjeva’s lab reported suspicions about possible data manipulation using photo editing software&nbsp; to the hospital and the journal. We spoke with the postdoc via email, where they shared evidence of their correspondence. They wished to remain anonymous for this story. We also reached out to Gadjeva for comment and got an email from her lawyers, Gelb &amp; Gelb LLP, based in Massachusetts, requesting that we direct any further communication through them. They have not responded to our queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The postdoc contacted the editor at <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> in August 2022 with concerns about the article. They alleged some data in figure 5 had been changed to support the claims in the paper.</p>



<p>The retraction notice doesn’t repeat the postdoc’s allegations of manipulation. Instead, it attributes the retraction to “concerns about the reliability of the reported results and conclusions” related to six figures, including figure 5. The authors acknowledged “some data underlying the figures of concern are no longer available,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice also stated the authors told editors they had combined multiple experiments during data preparation and analysis, and noted other factors that may have contributed to errors in the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After receiving the postdoc’s report, PLOS launched an investigation into the paper and reassessed the article, identifying additional duplications and errors, David Knutson, the head of communications at PLOS, told Retraction Watch. When we asked whether the journal’s own investigation into the paper addressed the allegations of data manipulation, Knutson responded, “Our publication ethics investigations do not investigate culpability or origin of error.”</p>



<p>To fix the problems, the authors offered updated figures, some original data and repeat data, but the journal’s editorial board concluded the materials&nbsp; “did not resolve the issues,” according to the retraction notice. After the two-year-long process, the paper was retracted this October.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The postdoc had reported the same issues to the hospital’s research integrity office in April 2022, several months before contacting the journal, but told Retraction Watch that they did not receive a response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked if Brigham and Women’s Hospital had looked into the postdoc’s concerns about the paper, a spokesperson for the hospital replied that Gadjeva “is not employed at BWH.” In a follow up email, she added, “We always undertake a robust and confidential process and respond to any claims that are brought to our attention in accordance with hospital policy and federal regulations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can not comment on the confidential process,” the email continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS contacted Brigham and Women’s Hospital to “discuss concerns,” Knutson said. Those discussions “are confidential,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our editorial decision was made independent from the information we received from the institute,” he told us. “PLOS retracted the article because we were unable to resolve the concerns raised in the absence of the underlying data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a separate incident in 2020, the attending veterinarian at Brigham and Women’s Hospital appeared to have suspended Gadjeva’s group from using an animal room — where lab rats are temporarily housed for experimentation — after an inspection found conditions that did not comply with regulations,&nbsp; according to an email describing the inspection report seen by Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>The room where the mice were housed was too cold, and the animals were kept in dirty cages, with little food and water supplies, according to the report. The inspector also found unsealed food, and no records for the animals.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Nada Yousif will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;Optimising burst based deep brain stimulation in a population model of Parkinson's disease and Tremor&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapy used to treat several neurological conditions
such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET), based on the implantation of
electrodes into specific brain targets. Despite its success, the electrical stimulus has
remained as a regular frequency square pulse for decades. Recently, there have been
proposals that phase-locking, coordinated reset or irregular stimulation patterns may be
more effective at desynchronising the pathological neural activity. Here we consider our
population level model of the thalamocortical-basal ganglia network, which generates
pathological oscillatory activity in the beta band (textasciitilde20 Hz) associated with
PD and the tremor band (textasciitilde4 Hz) associated with ET. We stimulate the model
with regular, irregular and phase-dependent bursts of DBS, and use an optimisation
technique to find the best stimulation parameters in each case. Our results show that
bursts can be as or more effective at suppressing pathological oscillations compared to
continuous DBS, allowing exploration of stimulation mechanisms to formulate testable
predictions regarding DBS.</p>
