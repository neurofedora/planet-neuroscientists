<p>An Elsevier journal has retracted three papers for plagiarism after more than a year of inaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/26/a-journal-editor-said-hed-retract-a-paper-for-plagiarism-a-year-later-it-hasnt-happened/">we reported in August</a>, the editor of the <em>International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems</em> in June 2023 promised to retract the articles, but they remained intact more than a year later.</p>



<p>The following papers have now been retracted:</p>



<span id="more-130220"></span>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061522001326?via%3Dihub">A robust vehicle to grid aggregation framework for electric vehicles charging cost minimization and for smart grid regulation</a> (18 citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014206152100418X">A robust optimization method for optimizing day-ahead operation of the electric vehicles aggregator</a> (20 citations)</li>



<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061521005974">Optimal power management framework for smart homes using electric vehicles and energy storage</a> (31 citations)</li>
</ul>



<p>The notices call the plagiarism a “severe abuse of the scientific publishing system.” The journal’s editor in chief, Vladimir Terzija, did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier told us “The retractions were submitted during a busy period and there were delays with the publisher,” adding that the authors did not make the retraction request.</p>



<p>Ubaid ur Rehman, the first or only author of all three papers, previously had two other<a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1#?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3d1%26auth%3dur%2bRehman%252c%2bUbaid"> articles retracted</a> from Springer Nature journals for plagiarism. ur Rehman did not respond to our request for comment but previously admitted the plagiarism in emails seen by Retraction Watch. He has over the past week asked us to remove our original post because the retractions were in the works.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uma.es/departamento-de-ingenieria-electrica/info/113635/salvador-pineda-morente/">Salvador Pineda</a>, one of the authors whose work was lifted, said he was “relieved” considering how much time and energy he invested in getting the paper that plagiarized his work retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That said, I&#8217;m still puzzled as to why the process took so long, even though the plagiarism was blatant, the author admitted to it, and the editor-in-chief supported retraction from the very beginning. I can only imagine how difficult it would be if the plagiarism hadn&#8217;t been so obvious,” Pineda, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Málaga, told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The journal should put more efforts to avoid the plagiarism rather than waiting for the authors to report the events,” said <a href="https://www.polito.it/personale?p=tao.huang">Tao Huang</a>, another author whose work was plagiarized and a professor at Politecnico di Torino in Italy. He recommended further penalties such as banning authors temporarily, from both the journal the plagiarized articles were published in and other journals by the same publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Surely, it is not a pleasant experience, but it was OK in the end,” Huang told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “delays” referred to by Elsevier resulted in the plagiarized papers accumulating several new citations, Pineda said, about two dozen since June 2023. “In any case, I&#8217;m happy that truth and science have prevailed in the end.”</p>



<p>Update, 2230 UTC, 10/18/24: We have corrected the number of previous retractions of papers by ur Rehman before these three papers; it was two, not three. </p>

<p>Editors of a psychology journal have published a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-31211-001.html">lengthy apology</a> for failing to identify “biased” language and information in a paper about racial prejudice of Tibetan children against Han Chinese.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2024-72017-001">The development of Tibetan children’s racial bias in empathy: The mediating role of ethnic identity and wrongfulness of ethnic intergroup bias</a>,” appeared in <em>Cultural Diversity &amp; Ethnic Minority Psychology </em>in April. It has yet to be cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors listed affiliations with institutions in China, Australia, and Canada. The article describes experiments measuring the empathy – or lack thereof – Tibetan children expressed for characters with Tibetan or Han Chinese names who experienced either social or physical pain.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130213"></span>



<p>“Our study sheds light on the development of [racial bias in empathy] in Tibetan school-aged children and highlights the importance of identifying the appropriate timing for intervening in prejudice,” the researchers concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The apology, published earlier this month, provides a detailed timeline of how a reader contacted the journal with concerns about the article soon after it was published, and how the editors responded. The reader had also asked the corresponding author to share the data reported in the publication, but hadn’t received a response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reader identified “biased language” in the article, such as the description of education in Tibet as “backward,” and “deficit-oriented interpretation of findings” attributing the development of racial bias in Tibetan children at least in part to “the geographical environment and traditional way of life in Tibet.” The area’s characteristics “limited its interactions with the outside world and contributed to a relatively closed mindset,” the authors wrote in the original article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The reader rightly pointed out that this language and interpretation reinforce imperialism, particularly given the complex relations between Tibet and China. We sincerely apologize to our readers, and especially to our Tibetan colleagues, for failing to identify these issues prior to the publication of the article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eventually, the first author shared the study data, codebook, and syntax files on an <a href="https://osf.io/texq2/?view_only=40c2f48e801340f8ae781209b481d401/">online repository</a>, and agreed to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-32719-001.html">correction</a> retracting several sentences from the article. The correction notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The authors wish to remove biased language and inappropriate discussion surrounding the comparison between the Tibetan sample and the non-Tibetan samples, and the text discussing the development of Tibetan children’s awareness of their own racial prejudice.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Jun Chen, the corresponding author, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Su Yeong Kim, the outgoing editor of the journal, said the authors addressed the reader’s concerns, so “we therefore decided to do an apology” instead of an expression of concern or retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The apology also lists future actions the editorial team will take, and a section with “perspectives to guide the interpretation” of findings in the original article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We (the journal) are deeply sorry about what occurred and are committed to ensuring that biased language and deficit interpretations are avoided in future publications. In addition, by requesting a retraction of biased sentences from the author and through resources provided on the interpretation of the original Sheng et al.’s (2024) publication, we have taken actions to help repair the damage caused by this publication. With these efforts, we commit more intentionally to our equity, diversity, and inclusion principles for the sake of producing anti-oppressive publications for our global readership. We acknowledge that the publication of this article may have caused readers to lose trust in the journal, and, together, we are currently taking action to reestablish reader confidence in CDEMP as outlined in the Future Actions to Be Taken by the CDEMP Editorial Team section.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Reinoud Maex will talk about his work in the presentation entitled &quot;A mechanism for ATP homeostasis based on activity-dependent synthesis and release of neurotransmitter&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It has long been recognised that many neurotransmitters bear a close relationship, for
their synthesis or degradation, to compounds of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle, the central
pathway for the production of the energy intermediary adenosine triphosphate (ATP). How
neurons maintain an almost constant level of ATP in their cytosol, in spite of varying
workloads, is still an outstanding question. Taking the relationship between glutamate
(Glu) and alpha-ketoglutarate as an example, a simple metabolic model was built of a Glu-
releasing axon terminal. The model included the interconversion between Glu and alpha-
ketoglutarate, the accumulation of Glu in synaptic vesicles, and the recycling of Glu
through an activity-induced supply of its precursor glutamine by the perisynaptic
astrocyte. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, the model was reduced to two differential
equations of the cytosolic concentration of Glu and ATP. This model showed remarkable
characteristics: at steady state, irrespective of the workload, the ATP level measured 1.5
mM, and only 4.7 % of the ATP was spent on Glu release and recycling. The speed of ATP
homeostasis was determined by the (absolute) amount of ATP the axon spent on vesicular Glu
accumulation. Overall, homeostasis came at little cost as it prevented futile ATP
production when the workload decreased. These analytical and numerical results indicate
that neurotransmitter release may confer to neurons a metabolic advantage in the form of a
more accurate ATP homeostasis.</p>

<p><em>Optical and Quantum Electronics</em>, a Springer Nature journal, has retracted more than 200 papers since the start of September, and continues issuing retraction notices en masse. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11082-024-07444-x">notices</a>, which have similar wording, the retractions come after the publisher identified problems with the articles including compromised peer review, inappropriate or irrelevant references, and nonsensical phrases, suggesting blind use of AI or machine-translation software.</p>



<p>“These investigations are based on intelligence from past work alongside whistleblower information,” Chris Graf, director of research integrity at Springer Nature in Oxford, UK, told <em>Retraction Watch</em>. But Graf declined to share the specifics of the inquiry: “We need to keep details of these investigations confidential to ensure that we do not inform the efforts of individuals who may engage in unethical activities.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>His <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a> had flagged nearly 50 articles in <em>Optical and Quantum Electronics</em> riddled with tortured phrases, mostly published in 2023. “I suspect papermill submissions + compromised peer review,” <a href="https://x.com/gcabanac/status/1754785367046180952">he wrote on X</a> at the time, referring to shady services that <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">sell authorship slots and citations on papers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac also <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/2F80E74D4042BDCD3537D12BDD421E">posted his concerns</a> about the papers, along with their tortured phrases, on PubPeer. In his post, he called on the publisher to retract or correct the papers that are not reliable.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Optical and Quantum Electronics </em>has three editors-in-chief, with some recent turnover. Xuelin Yang of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26581698">joined the journal</a> in January. Daoxin Dai of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, had <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/19116278">stepped down</a> in November 2023 after taking the post in April 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Yang nor Dai replied to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salah Obayya, director of the Center for Photonics and Smart Materials at the Zewail City of Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt, is one of the journal’s other editors-in-chief. He <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26581698">joined in June 2023</a>, taking over from Trevor Benson of the University of Nottingham, UK, whose tenure ended in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11082/updates/26613404">thank-you note</a> from Benson on the journal website reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I have served in the Editor in Chief role since mid-2005, during which time metrics confirm that the journal has grown significantly in size, stature, and reputation. Although I officially retired in July 2000, I have kept research active in seeing PhDs and projects through to completion, and with a small emeritus Fellowship from the Leverhulme Trust. As this activity is winding down, I feel the time is right for someone new to help drive the journal forward. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Obayya nor Benson responded to requests for comment. We also didn’t hear back from Marian Marciniak, the journal’s third editor-in-chief, who is based at the National Institute of Telecommunications Department of Transmission and Optical Technology in Warsaw, Poland.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Alongside this work and with the Editors-in-Chief, we have been strengthening the processes for all guest-edited issues at the journal such that no unsolicited proposals are considered, an editorial board member or one of the Editors-in-Chief must be part of the Guest Editor team, and new research integrity tools have been added to the front end of our submission process. All editorial board members have also undertaken extensive research integrity training.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Earlier this month, Springer Nature began an initial public offering (IPO), noting in its prospectus that increase in undeclared use of AI in the publication process and infiltration by paper mills is a significant threat to the publishing business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The publisher noted that earlier this year it identified “a significant number” of papers published by its journals originated from paper mills, adding:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The paper mills used guest-edited collections and fake peer reviews to evade quality control. While a large proportion of the papers and collections were brought to our attention by a third-party individual, some had already been flagged or identified through other means, and were already being investigated by our dedicated internal research integrity group. These investigations continue and could result in many retractions, which could negatively impact our reputation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another Springer Nature journal that seems to be retracting papers en masse is <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em>. The journal was one of 17 that this year <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">lost its Journal Impact Factor</a> — which is sometimes <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/whats-wrong-with-the-jif-in-five-graphs">used to evaluate researchers and their work</a> — due to suspected citation manipulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its IPO prospectus, Springer Nature had noted that if journals are excluded from Clarivate’s Journal Citation Reports database, “this could have a material detrimental effect on the results of our operations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July, a spokesperson for Clarivate, the firm that publishes Journal Impact Factors, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">told <em>Retraction Watch</em></a> the journals were suppressed from their report for having&nbsp; “anomalous citation behavior, including where there is evidence of excessive journal self-citation and/or citation stacking (which involves two or more journals). We do not presume a motive or accuse these journals of wrongdoing.”</p>



<p>As <em>Retraction Watch</em> has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/22/sleuths-spur-cleanup-at-journal-with-nearly-140-retractions-and-counting/">previously reported</a>, Cabanac and fellow sleuth <a href="https://thebulletin.org/biography/alexander-magazinov/">Alexander Magazinov</a> — software engineer at Yandex, an IT company based in Moscow, Russia — have previously flagged around 1,850 papers published by <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>for suspicious citations, tortured phrases, and undeclared use of AI in papers. By our count, the journal has so far retracted 225 papers as part of this batch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Environmental+Science+and+Pollution+Research">search for</a><em> Environmental Science and Pollution Research </em>on PubPeer yields some of the flagged and retracted studies.</p>



<p>One 2023 article <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-35102-y">retracted</a> by <em>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</em> on 25 September, was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-26647-5">titled</a>: “Association of the corona virus (Covid-19) epidemic with environmental risk factors.” This study has so far been cited two times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4C3BF43A3E49E979B8F8D340993961">PubPeer thread</a> about this study, its corresponding author, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Majid-Farhadi-6">Majid Farhadi</a> of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Iran, wrote: “We do not insist on using invalid articles and we ask you to agree to the correction. We are prepared to remove invalid articles.”</p>



<p>Another <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-16530-6">2021 study</a>, titled, “The modulatory potential of herbal antioxidants against oxidative stress and heavy metal pollution: plants against environmental oxidative stress,” was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-35004-z">pulled</a> on 17 September. This study has been cited 32 times so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But none of the study authors agreed with the study’s retraction. “Following the notification from the journal, we conducted a thorough review of our paper and found the sentences to be coherent and the phrases to adhere to standard conventions,” wrote corresponding author Zahra Ebrahimi of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Iran, on a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DAAF3DF3A2B5D0D5FC2D332A641024">PubPeer thread about the study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ebrahimi added on PubPeer:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It’s important to note that English is not the native language for any of the authors, and while we made efforts to refine the clarity of our text using tools like Grammarly before submission, we acknowledge that it may not mirror the fluency of native English speakers. Furthermore, [at] the paper&#8217;s revision stage, in response to the journal&#8217;s request for language editing to ensure text clarity and fluency, we engaged the services of NedMedica, viz., known as Article X as well, a language editing service by Brieflands company to ensure the high quality of the paper… </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ebrahimi disagrees that the study’s peer review process was compromised, noting:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Reviewers made a total of 23 comments on our initial paper and requested improvements even in the smallest details. Upon reviewing the extensive comments provided, it is evident that the review process followed the standard procedures. It is important to note that we were kept blind to the peer review process, and thus, we remain unaware of the identities of the reviewers involved. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that none of the editorial board members are based in Iran, and we have had no prior personal or professional relationships with them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She does, however, acknowledge some errors and oversights in the study’s references but remains convinced that the article’s validity remains intact. She wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>…it is important to highlight that the main issue in the article lies in the placement of the references rather than the validity of the references themselves. This discrepancy stemmed from the technical challenges with reference management software. We want to assure you that the references provided are capable of supporting all the claims made in the manuscript, provided they are cited in the correct locations. The scientific validity of the article remains intact. We had prepared a correction to the latest version of the manuscript we had, wherein we will indicate the appropriate placement for citing each manuscript. Ensuring the references are placed in their correct locations, removing the Vickers citation, and adding four references that were previously omitted due to technical issues, we have ensured that all claims made in the manuscript are adequately supported.</p>

<p>A public health journal has retracted an article on unintentional pesticide poisonings a year after the authors enlisted a lawyer’s help to fight the decision. </p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/15/authors-hire-lawyer-as-journal-plans-to-retract-their-article-on-pesticide-poisoning/">we reported</a> <em>BMC Public Health</em> had decided to retract the article, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09939-0">The global distribution of acute unintentional pesticide poisoning: estimations based on a systematic review</a>,” which appeared in December 2020. The article has been cited nearly 300 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including more than 100 since the journal told the authors it would be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors listed affiliations with the Pesticide Action Network, a collection of organizations opposed to pesticides. In their review, they declared unintentional pesticide poisoning “a problem that warrants immediate action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notice cites a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">letter to the editor</a> from employees of pesticide manufacturer Bayer, and the trade organization CropLife International, which criticized the analysis. The authors stood by their findings in a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11941-z">response</a>, stating the critics “do not seem to have understood our estimation method.”</p>



<span id="more-130206"></span>



<p>The authors tried to overturn the journal’s decision. In July 2023, a lawyer representing them sent the editors a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-07-14-Letter-Resp.-to-Editors-re-Global-UAPP-Article-Retraction.pdf">letter</a> arguing that the retraction would be “inappropriate,” as we previously reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, a journal editor wrote to the authors:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am sorry to inform you that we will be proceeding with the retraction of your article as we have lost confidence in the conclusions presented based on the original concerns raised in the <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">Matters Arising article</a> by Dunn et al. and on the assessment and advice received from our Editorial Board Members.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/reply-BMC-PH-2024-09-23.pdf">rebuttal</a>, the authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The envisaged retraction of our paper would be an unacceptable outcome of an unacceptable process. We have explained in detail in our rebuttals that the prevalences used in our extrapolations are not higher than annual prevalences and therefore no overestimation has taken place for this reason. We have repeatedly shown that even if the criticism were correct, it would have a negligible impact on the results of our study. A retraction would therefore be contrary to the journal&#8217;s own policy, which states that retractions are not appropriate when there is inconclusive evidence to support a retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-20318-x">notice</a>, published Wednesday, states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Editor has retracted this article because concerns were raised about the use of ‘ever’ prevalence of pesticide poisoning to represent annual frequency in the extrapolations by a reader and by Dunn et al. [<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11940-0">1</a>]. Expert assessment has confirmed the validity of this concern and also concluded that the assumption of annual exposure for countries where the time frame is not reported is unreliable. The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented.</p>



<p>All authors disagree with this retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides citing the source of the “concerns” and registering the authors’ disagreement, the notice matches the one the journal editor proposed to the authors last May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the publisher what held up the publication of the retraction. Natalie Pafitis, senior editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, said in a statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>While we endeavour to complete our investigations as swiftly and efficiently as possible, there are a number of reasons why these processes can, on occasion, take longer than expected.</p>



<p>In this instance, after readers raised concerns in January 2023, we launched an investigation into the paper in line with COPE guidelines, with support from the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group. This process included a post-publication review by several experts in the subject matter of the paper, and extensive communication with the authors. After careful consideration of both the post-publication reviews and the authors’ responses, we concluded that the most appropriate action to take was retraction of this paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another group of authors has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/04/authors-file-complaint-with-publisher-as-journal-retracts-vaping-paper/">complained</a> about the journal’s process for retractions.&nbsp;</p>

                Consuming cinnamon may have a very small effect on weight, but it’s unlikely to deliver meaningful weight loss without other lifestyle adjustments.

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-7.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="112" height="150" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130183"/></a></figure></div>


<p>In January 2022, <em>The Oncologist</em> switched publishers from Wiley to Oxford University Press.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/26/homeopathy-for-cancer-paper-extensively-corrected-after-watchdog-agency-requested-retraction/">issued an extensive correction</a> for one of its most popular articles, a 2020 paper that describes results of a clinical trial the authors claimed found a homeopathic intervention improved quality of life and survival for people with advanced lung cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://theoncologist.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/onco.13548">article page</a> that remains on Wiley’s website, however, does not reflect the recent correction.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130182"></span>



<p>We asked Wiley whether the publisher would update the page. A spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When a journal moves from one publisher to another, as in this case, it receives a new DOI and a new digital footprint. As a result, our current policy is to keep backfiles online for such journals, and to rely on the current publisher to carry any post-publication amendments.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher is “planning to review this process” in light of new guidelines from the National Information Standards Organisation regarding <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-45-2024-crec">Communication of Retractions, Removals, and Expressions of Concern</a>, the spokesperson said. (Disclosure: Our Ivan Oransky was on the working group for those guidelines.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the abstract of the guidelines states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It is crucial that researchers who discover a publication be able to identify the editorial status of the published item. It is therefore necessary that the identification of retracted items, removed content, and EoCs be effectively communicated to human researchers and that these same features be evident to machine-reading and other automated processes, as well as to other interested parties in the scholarly information workflow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 10/15/24, 1500 UTC: We note that while the journal has a new DOI, the original article’s DOI is unchanged. The subsequent correction was published using the journal’s new DOI. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">This month, we interviewed Dr Jessica Agnew-Blais, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Queen Mary University of London. Jessica discusses the journey of her career thus far, including moving to a new place, navigating finding a job, balancing motherhood, and the tips she has for students and early career researchers. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can you tell us about your background in science, your current area of study, and what interested you about neuroscience initially?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I’ve been interested in issues around mental health for as long as I can remember. Why people think, feel, and act the way they do is something I find innately interesting. However, I wasn’t always very clear about my career path, and in the US we don’t specialise at university until comparatively later, so I took several kinds of classes in subjects like History, Archaeology and English Literature, which I loved. I ended up majoring in Human Biology, which was an interdisciplinary major that combined biological, behavioural, social, and cultural perspectives to study human health and disease.</span></span><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Through my coursework I learned about public health school and realised this was a great fit for me, as I was interested in mental health at a population level. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I ended up getting my PhD in Epidemiology, which was a bit unexpected as I really </span></span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">did not</span></span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> enjoy my statistics course during university. Once I learned that I could use statistics to answer questions I was really interested in, such as why certain people were more likely to suffer with certain diseases, or why some people’s health worsened whilst others improved, I started to really love it. My focus for my PhD was Psychiatric Epidemiology, and I was super lucky to work with some amazing scientists who taught me a lot and were also really lovely people, which is so important. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After I finished my PhD I moved to London with my partner, which was good timing in some ways, but not great timing in others because I was visibly pregnant at that point. So, I went to a few job interviews but I could tell people were looking at me and thinking, “um, what are you doing here?”. But it worked out well in the end, as by the time I had my daughter and was ready to go back to work, a postdoc position opened up with the E-Risk study. E-Risk is based at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London, and involves a twin study of over 2000 monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Twin studies are really cool because they leverage the “natural experiment” of twinship to help disentangle genetic and environmental effects (because identical twins share 100% of their DNA and fraternal twins share 50%, but importantly both sets of twins share the same, or a very similar, environment). </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As part of the E-Risk study, we looked at the course of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from childhood to young adulthood, and found some really interesting results, especially about individuals that were meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD in young adulthood. Surprisingly, we found that a large proportion of people, who met all the symptoms and impairment criteria for ADHD at age 18, hadn’t done so when parents and teachers reported on their ADHD symptoms in childhood. This was really surprising because, by definition in the DSM (the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders), ADHD often emerges  prior to age 12.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One interesting thing, about those who tended not to meet ADHD criteria until young adulthood, was that they were more likely to be women. Trying to understand this finding steered me towards my current research, which is focused on looking at ADHD, over the life course, among girls and women. I am currently funded by a New Investigator Research Grant from the UK Medical Research Council to examine these questions, including childhood and adolescent factors that may lead to late diagnosis, how ADHD symptoms change across puberty, as well as whether ADHD symptoms fluctuate across the menstrual cycle amongst women with ADHD. More information about my current research can be found at </span></span><u><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><a href="https://www.adhdlifelab.com/" target="_blank">our team’s website</a></span></span></u><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are the most enjoyable aspects of your current job?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I have an amazing team of early career researchers in my lab and working with them is a real highlight of my job. I also have fantastic co-workers at QMUL who are so thoughtful, supportive and fun; they improve my research as well as my mood on an everyday basis. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are some of the challenging aspects of your current job? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As a lecturer we have a lot of different responsibilities—teaching, supervising projects, students , providing pastoral care, marking, reviewing academic papers, managing research budgets, and writing grants. I find it challenging to switch back and forth between all these different tasks. It’s easy to spend all your time on short-term tasks and not focus on the deeper thinking that goes into writing and research. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What are you currently trying to get better at in your neuroscience job? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Ooof, time management is eternally something I am trying to get better at. I am not naturally a super organised person, so I try to borrow various strategies from my more organised friends and colleagues, like tracking my time to see how long various tasks take. But I’m far from having discovered the secret to being good at this! </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Which women in your life inspire you, in neuroscience and beyond? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I was really lucky to have had amazing female mentors during my PhD and postdoc, like Professor Karestan Koenen at the Harvard School of Public Health and Professor Louise Arseneault at the IoPPN at King’s College London. I am also very inspired by my female colleagues at work, several of whom also have young children, and we are always sharing the joys and the challenges of being working mothers. I also had a working mother, and I have very distinct memories of watching her go off to work when I was a kid, and I think having this in the back of my mind helped me make this choice for myself. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What goals do you have for your career, and where do you see yourself in the next few years professionally?</span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #BF7DA7;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">One study I am working on now looks at how ADHD symptoms and impairment may change for women across the menstrual cycle. The effects of hormones on the brain and on women’s mental health are often overlooked, and this is perhaps especially true for women with neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD and autism. Over the next few years, I would like to continue to focus on these questions, including a research focus on perimenopause and menopause among neurodiverse women. Perimenopause and menopause is a very under-researched phase of life for women; many women with ADHD, who I have worked and spoken to, pointed to this time period as one they were really concerned about and wanted to have more research on. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What advice would you give to women at the early stages of their neuroscience careers and to women wanting to pursue a research career investigating ADHD? </span></span></strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think there is so much interesting work to be done in many areas, and of course, especially ADHD. As far as advice, I would say that there are ups and downs in research, and periods of time where things are going well and you’re publishing, getting grants etc, and then lulls where it feels like things are going really slowly and nothing is working out. Sometimes you just have to ride the wave for a bit (either way), know that things will change and try not to have your self-concept be too influenced by these phases. And of course, academia is not the only way to do research, and not the only way to do neuroscience, so I would also encourage people to think outside the box as well as other ways they can engage with neuroscience, via working for funders, industry, charities, the government etc. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What aspects of the science/academic industry do you think need improving/addressing, particularly in terms of issues minority groups may face?</span></span></strong><span style="color: #A5698A;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I think it’s important for students/early career researchers to have mentors they can see themselves in - people who may have had similar experiences or faced similar challenges. Given the overall under-representation of women and people of colour in higher levels of academia, this is something that needs to be improved. </span></span></p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-6.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="198" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130180"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Naohiro Kameta</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A nanotube researcher in Japan has earned 13 retractions, with more to come, after an extensive investigation by the country’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) revealed widespread misconduct in his work. </p>



<p>AIST’s investigation found Naohiro Kameta, senior principal researcher at the Nanomaterials Research Institute located in AIST’s Ibaraki campus, fabricated and falsified dozens of studies. He was apparently dismissed from his role following the findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The institute first learned of the problems in Kameta’s work in November 2022, according to a translated version of the <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">investigation report</a>. Initially, they looked into five papers, but eventually expanded their scrutiny to 61 articles on which Kameta was the lead or responsible author.</p>



<span id="more-130178"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/Portals/0/resource_images/aist_j/information/240329_anken1.pdf">The investigation</a>, which wrapped up in December 2023, found Kameta had “independently committed research misconduct” by fabricating and falsifying data in 42 papers published between 2005 and 2022. According to the findings, Kameta cut out parts of electron micrographs to portray them as different structures. He also falsified scale bars of diagrams to be longer or shorter – <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10847-024-01257-x">in one instance</a> making the scale almost 10 times larger than the true size of the material shown. The report added Kameta’s research notes were incomplete and many of the samples he should have preserved were discarded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kameta received about $230,000 (more than ¥33 million) in grant funding for research topics broadly related to the misconduct, of which approximately $35,000 was directly spent on the work described in the papers AIST found to have fake data, according to the investigation report. The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science <a href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-kousei/sochi/2024-4-8.html">has ordered the research funds be returned</a>, and stated they will not provide funding to Kameta for 10 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investigators at AIST collected responses to a questionnaire sent to more than 20 other individuals who had co-authored papers with Kameta. According to their responses, many of them had trusted Kameta’s expertise and didn’t critically review the data or images presented in the final publications. In some cases, co-authors admitted they didn’t check the papers before submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19 papers AIST reviewed that didn’t appear to have evidence of research misconduct, the investigation found data discrepancies in 14 that did not significantly affect the conclusions of the papers. Those issues may have arisen because of “carelessness,” according to the investigators, who recommended Kameta request corrections for these articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The institution also identified Toshimi Shimizu and Mitsutoshi Masuda, colleagues of Kameta at AIST, as authors responsible for the content of the papers, but found they were not involved in any misconduct. Shimizu’s staff page <a href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/tshmz-shimizu/Home-e.html">remains active</a> on the AIST website, although his institutional email bounced back when we attempted to contact him. Masuda is listed as a <a href="https://unit.aist.go.jp/ischem/en/organization/index.html">deputy director</a> of sustainable chemistry at the institute. He did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several journals have already begun retracting Kameta’s work, and more are expected to follow. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Naohiro-Misconduct-Papers.xlsx">By our count</a>, out of the 42 papers identified as problematic, 13 have so far been retracted. Fourteen of the remaining, unretracted papers appeared in journals published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. A representative of the publisher said they were aware of the issues and would be pursuing retractions of the papers. Five other unretracted papers appeared in journals published by the American Chemical Society. The publisher has not responded to requests for comment. </p>



<p>In July, <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/au20240731_1.html">the institution released a statement regarding Kameta’s case, announcing that </a>“one employee found to have been involved in research misconduct will be dismissed.” Another employee not involved in misconduct, but responsible for the papers, would be suspended from work for a month, according to the statement. AIST’s press office would not confirm whether the dismissed employee was Kameta, but the investigators identified Kameta as the only individual responsible for the misconduct. Kameta no longer has a staff profile on the institution’s website and his email bounced back when we attempted to contact him.</p>
