              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-fatigue-end-covid-19-burnout-2022">Why pandemic fatigue and COVID-19 burnout took over in 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>2022 was the year many people decided the coronavirus pandemic had ended.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden said as much in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-joe-biden-60-minutes-interview-transcript-2022-09-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with <em>60 Minutes</em></a><em> </em>in September. “The pandemic is over,” he said while strolling around the Detroit Auto Show. “We still have a problem with COVID. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over.”</p>



<p>His evidence? “No one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape.”</p>



<p>But the week Biden’s remarks aired, about 360 people were still dying each day from COVID-19 in the United States. Globally, about 10,000 deaths were recorded every week. That’s “10,000 too many, when most of these deaths could be prevented,” the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news briefing at the time. Then, of course, there are the millions who are still dealing with lingering symptoms long after an infection.</p>

<p>Those staggering numbers have stopped alarming people, maybe because those stats came on the heels of two years of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-one-million-death-toll-us-americans-number-mind-psychology">mind-boggling death counts</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/18/22</em>). Indifference to the mounting death toll may reflect pandemic fatigue that settled deep within the public psyche, leaving many feeling over and done with safety precautions.</p>



<p>“We didn’t warn people about fatigue,” says Theresa Chapple-McGruder, an epidemiologist in the Chicago area. “We didn’t warn people about the fact that pandemics can last long and that we still need people to be willing to care about yourselves, your neighbors, your community.”</p>



<p>Public health agencies around the world, including in Singapore and the United Kingdom, reinforced the idea that we could “return to normal” by learning to “live with COVID.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-cdc-mask-guidelines-metrics-risk">guidelines raised the threshold for case counts</a> that would trigger masking (<em>SN Online: 3/3/22</em>). The agency also shortened <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-cdc-guidelines-back-to-school-masks-testing-coronavirus">suggested isolation times for infected people to five days</a>, even though most people still test positive for the virus and are potentially infectious to others for several days longer (<em>SN Online: 8/19/22</em>).</p>



<p>The shifting guidelines bred confusion and put the onus for deciding when to mask, test and stay home on individuals. In essence, the strategy shifted from public health — protecting your community — to individual health — protecting yourself.</p>

<p>Doing your part can be exhausting, says Eric Kennedy, a sociologist specializing in disaster management at York University in Toronto. “Public health is saying, ‘Hey, you have to make the right choices every single moment of your life.’ Of course, people are going to get tired with that.”</p>



<p>Doing the right thing — from getting vaccinated to wearing masks indoors — didn’t always feel like it paid off on a personal level. As good as the vaccines are at keeping people from becoming severely ill or dying of COVID-19, they were not as effective at protecting against infection. This year, many people who tried hard to make safe choices and had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">avoided COVID-19 got infected by wily omicron variants</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/22/22</em>). People sometimes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-covid-again-reinfection-omicron">got reinfected</a> — some more than once (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 8</em>).</p>





<p>Those infections may have contributed to a sense of futility. “Like, ‘I did my best. And even with all of that work, I still got it. So why should I try?’ ” says Kennedy, head of a Canadian project monitoring the sociological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Getting vaccinated, masking and getting drugs or antibody treatments can reduce the severity of infection and may cut the chances of infecting others. “We should have been talking about this as a community health issue and not a personal health issue,” Chapple-McGruder says. “We also don’t talk about the fact that our uptake [of these tools] is nowhere near what we need” to avoid the hundreds of daily deaths.</p>



<p>A lack of data about how widely the coronavirus is still circulating makes it difficult to say whether the pandemic is ending. In the United States, the influx of home tests was “a blessing and a curse,” says Beth Blauer, data lead for the Johns Hopkins University <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coronavirus Resource Center</a>. The tests gave an instant readout that told people whether they were infected and should isolate. But because those results were rarely reported to public health officials, true numbers of cases became difficult to gauge, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-data-surge-spread-testing-wastewater-yankee-candles">creating a big data gap</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/27/22</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Lagging on vaccines &nbsp;</h3>



<p>About 80 percent of the U.S. population got the first COVID-19 vaccine dose and close to 70 percent completed the primary series. The updated booster, made available in September, had only made it into the arms of 12 percent of people age 5 and older as of November 24.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The flow of COVID-19 data from many state and local agencies also slowed to a trickle. In October, even the CDC began reporting cases and deaths <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly instead of daily</a>. Altogether, undercounting of the coronavirus’s reach became worse than ever.</p>



<p>“We’re being told, ‘it’s up to you now to decide what to do,’ ” Blauer says, “but the data is not in place to be able to inform real-time decision making.”</p>



<p>With COVID-19 fatigue so widespread, businesses, governments and other institutions have to find ways to step up and do their part, Kennedy says. For instance, requiring better ventilation and filtration in public buildings could clean up indoor air and reduce the chance of spreading many respiratory infections, along with COVID-19. That’s a behind-the-scenes intervention that individuals don’t have to waste mental energy worrying about, he says.</p>



<p>The bottom line: People may have stopped worrying about COVID-19, but the virus isn’t done with us yet. “We have spent two-and-a-half years in a long, dark tunnel, and we are just beginning to glimpse the light at the end of that tunnel. But it is still a long way off,” WHO’s Tedros said. “The tunnel <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1572953387314057219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is still dark, with many obstacles</a> that could trip us up if we don’t take care.” If the virus makes a resurgence, will we see it coming and will we have the energy to combat it again?</p>

<p><strong>A New Figure for the Cosmic Speed Limit </strong>– <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-figure-cosmic-speed-limit"><em>Science News</em></a>, December 2, 1972</p>



<p>A group at the National Bureau of Standards at B­oulder, Colo., now reports an extremely accurate [speed of light] measurement using the wavelength and frequency of a helium-neon laser.… The result gives the speed of light as 299,792.4562 kilometers per second.</p>

<p>That 1972 experiment measured the two-way speed of light, or the average speed of photons that traveled from their source to a reflective surface and back. The result, which still holds up, helped scientists redefine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/light-recipe-new-meter">the standard length of the meter</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/83, p. 263</em>). But they weren’t done putting light through its paces. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, photons set a record for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/17561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowest measured speed of light</a> at 17 meters per second and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-stands-still-atom-clouds">froze in their tracks</a> for one-thousandth of a second (<em>SN: 1/27/01, p. 52</em>). For all that success, one major hurdle remains: directly testing the one-way speed of light. The measurement, which many scientists say is impossible to make, could resolve the long-standing question of whether the speed of light is uniform in all directions.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/social-distance-g90129feb9_1920-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, many clinical trials about COVID-19 were registered and conducted. In 2020, our team analyzed research methodology and characteristics of journal articles with original data, preprint articles and registered clinical trial protocols about COVID-19. During the conduct of the study, which was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01047-2">published in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em></a>, we noticed that many registered clinical trials for COVID-19 mentioned standard of care (SoC) as a comparator for an intervention tested for COVID-19 but without an explanation/description of what will be the SoC.</p>
<p>SoC (also called standard care, standard treatment, usual care, basic care, conventional treatment) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15265160802654129">normally means the best currently available</a>, proven treatment, established effective treatment. So, we were very confused by the fact that trials designed in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic would use the term “standard of care”. If the disease is new, we cannot have an SoC for it yet.</p>
<p>Thus, we decided to conduct a new study in which we ought to examine what the trial authors decided to proclaim SoC for an emergent disease. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-022-01646-1">our analysis, published recently in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em></a>, we screened 6022 records from the WHO ICTRP clinical trial registry, 9358 preprint records and 356 records from Cochrane COVID–19 Study Register related to COVID-19. We found 737 trials that reported they used standard, usual, conventional, or routine treatment for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Among 737 unique trials included in the analysis, only 129 (18%) trials reported component(s) of SoC; the remaining trials simply reported that they used SoC, with no further detail. Among those 129 trials, the number of components of SoC ranged from 1 to 10. The most commonly used groups of interventions in the SoC were antiparasitics (62% of the trials), antivirals (57%), antibiotics (31%), oxygen (17%), antithrombotics/anticoagulants (14%), vitamins (13%), immunomodulatory agents (13%), corticosteroids (12%), analgesics/antipyretics (12%). Various combinations of those interventions were used in the SoC, with up to 7 different types of interventions combined. Dosing, timing, and method of administration were frequently not reported for SoC components.</p>
<p>This study has highlighted multiple problems. Firstly, our study indicates that many experimental, i.e. investigational interventions, were described as SoC in early COVID-19 trials, even though their risk/benefit profile in targeted patients was unknown. Secondly, many of those interventions were later proven ineffective or even detrimental to patients suffering from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the majority of trials poorly reported therapy given to participants. Research that is poorly reported is considered research waste. Clinical trials need to be transparently reported to be replicable, and providing details about interventions is essential. This is also important for many other reasons, such as more accurate risk-benefit assessment, adherence to reporting guidelines, ethics and future research. Authors of future trials need to transparently report their interventions in all reports about the trial, including the study registrations, study protocols and full research reports. It is particularly disheartening to see so many poorly reported clinical trials related to the topic of a public health emergency.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that this was not a study that aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of any type of intervention for COVID-19. We know that many interventions used early in the COVID-19 pandemic to treat patients can be considered experimental (i.e. investigational) as the disease was previously unknown. Instead, we intended to analyze which interventions the trialists labelled as SoC.</p>
<p>The trialists did not have to use the term SoC when describing the therapies they decided to give to their patients in the trial as comparators. The term SoC implies that something is the standard, i.e. usual therapy, in a certain setting. We consider that in the early stage of the pandemic, there could be no SoC in the real sense since the disease was new. Thus, it was curious that so many trialists opted to use the term SoC.</p>
<p>An additional aspect of our study is that we have shown the wide diversity of the SoC, showcasing all kinds of experimental/investigational approaches that were tested initially when treating COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>A takeaway message is that the term “standard of care” should not be used lightly in reports about interventions for emergent diseases and that authors should better report their clinical trials so that their methods are transparent and replicable.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brief-burst-activity-health-benefits">Brief bursts of activity offer health benefits for people who don’t exercise</a></h4>

              
                <p>Making day-to-day activities more vigorous for a few minutes — such as briefly stepping up the pace of a walk — could offer people who don&#8217;t exercise some of the health benefits that exercisers enjoy.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new study of roughly 25,000 adults who reported no exercise in their free time. Those who incorporated three one- to two-minute bursts of intense activity per day saw a nearly a 40 percent drop in the risk of death from any cause compared with those whose days didn’t include such activity. The risk of death from cancer also fell by nearly 40 percent, and the risk of death from cardiovascular disease dropped almost 50 percent, researchers report online December 8 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>





<p>In a comparison with around 62,000 people who exercised regularly, including runners, gym-goers and recreational cyclists, the mortality risk reduction was similar.</p>



<p>“This study adds to other literature showing that even short amounts of activity are beneficial,” says Lisa Cadmus-Bertram, a physical activity epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved in the research. “So many people are daunted by feeling that they don’t have the time, money, motivation, transportation, etc. to go to a gym regularly or work out for long periods of time,” she says. “The message we can take is that it is absolutely worth doing what you can.”</p>



<p>Emmanuel Stamatakis, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney, and his colleagues analyzed a subset of records from the UK Biobank, a biomedical database containing health information on half a million people in the United Kingdom. The study’s non-exercising participants — more than half of whom were women and were 62 years old on average — had worn movement-tracking devices for a week.</p>



<p>Over an average seven years of follow-up, for those whose days included three to four bursts of activity, the mortality rate was 4.2 deaths from any cause per 1,000 people for one year. For those with no activity bursts, it was 10.4 deaths per 1,000 people for one year.</p>



<p>The researchers were looking for bursts of vigorous activity that met a definition determined in a laboratory study, including reaching at least 77 percent of maximum heart rate and at least 64 percent of maximum oxygen consumption. In real life, the signs that someone has reached the needed intensity level are “an increase in heart rate and feeling out of breath” in the first 15 to 30 seconds of an activity, Stamatakis says.</p>



<p>Regular daily activities offer several opportunities for these vigorous bursts, he says. “The simplest one is maximizing walking pace for a minute or two during any regular walk.” Other options, he says, include carrying grocery bags to the car or taking the stairs. “The largest population health gains will be realized by finding ways to get the least physically active people to move a little more.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-to-make-metal-snowflakes">How to make tiny metal snowflakes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Look closely at a snowflake, and you’ll observe a one-of-a-kind gossamer lattice, its growth influenced by ambient conditions like temperature and humidity. Turns out, this sort of intricate self-assemblage can also occur in metals, researchers report in the Dec. 9 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>In pools of molten gallium, physicist Nicola Gaston and colleagues <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm2731" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grew zinc nanostructures</a> with symmetrical, hexagonal crystal frameworks. Such metal snowflakes could be useful for catalyzing chemical reactions and constructing electronics, says Gaston, of the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.</p>





<p>“Self-assembly is the way nature makes nanostructures,” she says. “We&#8217;re trying to learn to do the same things.” Figuring out how to craft tiny, complex metal shapes in fewer steps and with less energy could be a boon for manufacturers.</p>



<p>The researchers chose gallium as a growth medium, due to its relatively low melting point, ability to dissolve many other metals and the tendency for its atoms to loosely organize while in a liquid state.</p>



<p>After mixing zinc into the gallium, the team subjected the alloy to elevated temperatures and different pressures, and then let the mixture cool to room temperature. The loose ordering of gallium atoms appeared to coax the crystallizing zinc to bloom into symmetrical, hexagonal structures resembling natural snowflakes and other shapes, the team found. It’s somewhat like how a fruit tray imparts order on the fruits stacked within, Gaston says.</p>



<p>The future may be bright for research into applications of gallium and other low-temperature liquid metals. “Not to take that snowflake metaphor too far, but [this work] really hints at new branches for scientific discovery,” Gaston says.</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS issued the following press release on Thursday, December 8, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash;The <a href="https://plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a> (PLOS) today announced that it has partnered with <a href="https://eartharxiv.github.io/index.html">EarthArXiv</a>, which enables authors submitting to <em>PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, and <em>PLOS Water</em> to post preprints with ease. Beginning next year, submitting authors will have the option to automatically forward their manuscript to the EarthArXiv preprint server, directly from our submission system.</p>



<p>PLOS sees preprints as integral to our mission of accelerating progress in scholarly research, and to our goal of increasing adoption of Open Science practices. Authors use preprints to establish priority, broadcast results, seek community feedback, and advance their careers. Early, transparent sharing via preprints disseminates new insights faster and increases efficiency across the entire research ecosystem.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Researchers told us they needed a community-recognized solution for sharing preprints when submitting to <em>PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, and <em>PLOS Water</em>. We&rsquo;re thrilled to partner with EarthArXiv &ndash; hosted by the California Digital Library &ndash; to offer these research communities an integrated solution that meets their needs and enhances our author service,&rdquo; said Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director of Open Research Solutions at PLOS.</p>



<p>EarthArXiv is a community-based server, governed by a diverse advisory council with representatives from many regions and institutions, and hosted by the <a href="https://cdlib.org/">California Digital Library (CDL),</a> an organization committed to open scholarship.</p>



<p>Tom Narock, Co-Founder of EarthArXiv and a member of its Advisory Council adds, &ldquo;The EarthArXiv preprint community welcomes PLOS as a new partner. We are excited to combine our joint interests in open-access research publication. Preprints allow colleagues to easily find, use, and review the latest research results. PLOS&rsquo; streamlined integration with EarthArXiv expands our open-access research offerings while making preprinting easier for Earth science researchers.&rdquo;</p>



<p>EarthArXiv is PLOS&rsquo; third preprint server integration. Our previously established partnerships with <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a> have shown that preprint posting is a valued author service, and that making preprint sharing easy for authors increases their uptake. PLOS is now expanding the benefits of facilitated posting to more of the researchers and research communities we serve.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/metric-system-prefixes-what-to-know">The metric system is growing. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Meet the metric system’s newest prefixes: ronna-, quetta-, ronto- and quecto-.</p>



<p>Adopted November 18 at the 27th General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles, France, ronna- and quetta- <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2022/resolution-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describe exceedingly large numbers</a> while ronto- and quecto- describe the exceedingly small. This is the first time that the International System of Units, or <a href="https://youtu.be/LqFbuRbOUtA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SI, has expanded</a> since 1991, when the prefixes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/measuring-superconductor-magnetic-noise">zetta-, yotta-, zepto and yocto-</a> were added (<em>SN: 1/16/93</em>).</p>



<p>Numerically, ronna- is 10<sup>27 </sup>(that’s a digit followed by 27 zeroes) and quetta- is 10<sup>30</sup> (30 zeroes). Their tiny counterparts ronto- and quecto- also refer to 27 and 30 zeroes, but those come after a decimal point. Until now, yotta- and yocto- (24 zeros) capped off the metric system’s range.</p>





<p><em>Science New</em>s spoke with Richard Brown, head of metrology at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, England, about <a href="https://www.npl.co.uk/si-prefix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what the latest SI expansion means for science</a>. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Why do we need the new prefixes?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brown:</strong> The quantity of data in the world is increasing exponentially. And we expect that to continue to increase and probably accelerate because of quantum computing, digitalization and things like that. At the same time, this quantity of data is starting to get close to the top range of the prefixes we currently use. People start to ask what comes next?</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Where do the prefix names come from?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brown: </strong>About five years ago, I heard a BBC podcast about these new names for quantities of data. And the two that they mentioned were brontobyte and hellabyte. Brontobyte, I think comes from brontosaurus being a big dinosaur and hellabyte comes from “‘hell of a big number.”</p>



<p>The problem with those from a metrology point of view, or measurement point of view, is they start with letters B and H, which already are in use for other units and prefixes. So we can&#8217;t have those as names. [It was clear] that we had to do something official because people were starting to need these prefixes. R and Q are not used for anything else, really, in terms of units or SI prefixes. [The prefix names themselves are] very, very loosely based on the Greek and Latin names for nine and 10.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> How will the prefixes be used?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brown: </strong>The whole point of the International System of Units is it&#8217;s an accepted global system, which if you use, you will be understood.</p>



<p>When you use a prefix with a unit, it means that the number associated with the unit changes. And people like small numbers that they can understand. So you can express the mass of the Earth in terms of ronnagrams; it&#8217;s six ronnagrams. And equally the mass of Jupiter is two quettagrams. Some good examples of [small numbers] are that the mass of an electron is about one rontogram, and the mass of one bit of data as stored on a mobile phone is around one quectogram. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the use of a suitable prefix makes things more understandable. And I think we shouldn&#8217;t forget that even if there&#8217;s not always a direct scientific usage immediately, they will gain traction over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gamma-ray-burst-breaks-rules-kilonova">A bizarre gamma-ray burst breaks the rules for these cosmic eruptions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astronomers have spotted a bright gamma-ray burst that upends previous theories of how these energetic cosmic eruptions occur.</p>



<p>For decades, astronomers thought that GRBs came in two flavors, long and short — that is, lasting longer than two seconds or winking out more quickly. Each type has been linked to different cosmic events. But about a year ago, two NASA space telescopes caught a short GRB in long GRB’s clothing: It lasted a long time but originated from a short GRB source.</p>





<p>“We had this black-and-white vision of the universe,” says astrophysicist Eleonora Troja of the Tor Vergata University of Rome. “This is the red flag that tells us, nope, it’s not. Surprise!”</p>



<p>This burst, called GRB 211211A, is the first that unambiguously breaks the binary, Troja and others report December 7 in five papers in <em>Nature</em> and <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>Prior to the discovery of this burst, astronomers mostly thought that there were just two ways to produce a GRB. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boat-brightest-gamma-ray-burst-supernova">collapse of a massive star</a> just before it explodes in a supernova could make a long gamma-ray burst, lasting more than two seconds (<em>SN: 10/28/22</em>). Or a pair of dense stellar corpses called neutron stars could collide, merge and form a new black hole, releasing a short gamma-ray burst of two seconds or less.</p>



<p>But there had been some outliers. A surprisingly short GRB in 2020 seemed to come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/short-gamma-ray-burst-star-core-collapse-explosion">a massive star’s implosion</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/21</em>). And some long-duration GRBs dating back to 2006 lacked a supernova after the fact, raising questions about their origins.</p>



<p>“We always knew there was an overlap,” says astrophysicist Chryssa Kouveliotou of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who wrote the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...413L.101K/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1993 paper that introduced the two GRB categories</a>, but was not involved in the new work. “There were some outliers which we did not know how to interpret.”</p>



<p>There’s no such mystery about GRB 211211A: The burst lasted more than 50 seconds and was clearly accompanied by a kilonova, the characteristic glow of new elements being forged after a neutron star smashup.</p>

Zamani/International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA, NASA, ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Although we suspected it was possible that extended emission GRBs were mergers … this is the first confirmation,” says astrophysicist Benjamin Gompertz of the University of Birmingham in England, who describes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01819-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observations of the burst</a> in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. “It has the kilonova, which is the smoking gun.”</p>



<p>NASA’s Swift and Fermi space telescopes detected the explosion on December 11, 2021, in a galaxy about 1.1 billion light-years away. “We thought it was a run-of-the-mill long gamma-ray burst,” says astrophysicist Wen-fai Fong of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>





<p>It was relatively close by, as GRBs go. So that allowed Fong’s and Troja’s research groups to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05390-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independently</a> continue closely <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05327-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observing</a> the burst in great detail using telescopes on the ground, the teams report in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>As the weeks wore on and no supernova appeared, the researchers grew confused. Their observations revealed that whatever had made the GRB had also emitted much more optical and infrared light than is typical for the source of a long GRB.</p>



<p>After ruling out other explanations, Troja and colleagues compared the burst’s aftereffects with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">first kilonova ever observed in concert with ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). The match was nearly perfect. “That’s when many people got convinced we were talking about a kilonova,” she says.</p>



<p>In retrospect, it feels obvious that it was a kilonova, Troja says. But in the moment, it felt as impossible as seeing a lion in the Arctic. “It looks like a lion, it roars like a lion, but it shouldn’t be here, so it cannot be,” she says. “That’s exactly what we felt.”</p>



<p>Now the question is, what happened? Typically, merging neutron stars collapse into a black hole almost immediately. The gamma rays come from material that is superheated as it falls into the black hole, but the material is scant, and the black hole gobbles it up within two seconds. So how did GRB 211211A keep its light going for almost a minute?</p>



<p>It’s possible that the neutron stars first merged into a single, larger neutron star, which briefly resisted the pressure to collapse into a black hole. That has implications for the fundamental physics that describes how difficult it is to crush neutrons into a black hole, Gompertz says.</p>



<p>Another possibility is that a neutron star collided with a small black hole, about five times the mass of the sun, instead of another neutron star. And the process of the black hole eating the neutron star took longer.</p>



<p>Or it could have been something else entirely: a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05403-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neutron star merging with a white dwarf</a>, astrophysicist Bing Zhang of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and colleagues suggest in <em>Nature</em>. “We suggest a third type of progenitor, something very different from the previous two types,” he says.</p>



<p>White dwarfs are the remnants of smaller stars like the sun, and are not as dense or compact as neutron stars. A collision between a white dwarf and a neutron star could still produce a kilonova if the white dwarf is very heavy.</p>



<p>The resulting object could be a highly magnetized neutron star called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-spotted-colliding-neutron-stars-magnetar">magnetar</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). The magnetar could have continued pumping energy into gamma rays and other wavelengths of light, extending the life of the burst, Zhang says.</p>



<p>Whatever its origins, GRB 211211A is a big deal for physics. “It is important because we wanted to understand, what on Earth are these events?” Kouveliotou says.</p>



<p>Figuring out what caused it could illuminate how heavy elements in the universe form. And some previously seen long GRBs that scientists thought were from supernovas might actually be actually from mergers.</p>



<p>To learn more, scientists need to find more of these binary-busting GRBs, plus observations of gravitational waves at the same time. Trejo thinks they’ll be able to get that when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, comes back online in 2023.</p>



<p>“I hope that LIGO will produce some evidence,” Kouveliotou says. “Nature might be graceful and give us a couple of these events with gravitational wave counterparts, and maybe [help us] understand what’s going on.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope brought us new views of the cosmos</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">This year marked the end of a decades-long wait for astronomers. The James Webb Space Telescope is finally in action.</p>



<p>The telescope, which launched in December 2021, released its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first science data in July</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 30</em>) and immediately began surpassing astronomers’ expectations.</p>



<p>“We’ve realized that James Webb is 10 times more sensitive than we predicted” for some kinds of observations, says astronomer Sasha Hinkley of the University of Exeter in England. His team released in September the telescope’s first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">direct image of an exoplanet</a> (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 6</em>). He credits “the people who worked so hard to get this right, to launch something the size of a tennis court into space on a rocket and get this sensitive machinery to work perfectly. And I feel incredibly lucky to be the beneficiary of this.”</p>





<p>The telescope, also known as JWST, was designed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">to see further back into the history of the cosmos</a> than ever before (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 26</em>). It’s bigger and more sensitive than its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. And because it looks in much longer wavelengths of light, JWST can observe distant and veiled objects that were previously hidden.</p>



<p>JWST spent its first several months collecting “early-release” science data, observations that test the different ways the telescope can see. “It is a very, very new instrument,” says Lamiya Mowla, an astronomer at the University of Toronto. “It will take some time before we can characterize all the different observation modes of all four instruments that are on board.”</p>



<p>That need for testing plus the excitement has led to some confusion for astronomers in these heady early days. Data from the telescope had been in such high demand that the operators hadn’t yet calibrated all the detectors before releasing data. The JWST team is providing calibration information so researchers can properly analyze the data. “We knew calibration issues were going to happen,” Mowla says.</p>



<p>The raw numbers that scientists have pulled out of some of the initial images may end up being revised slightly. But the pictures themselves are real and reliable, even though it takes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-challenges-artists-see-infrared">some artistry</a> to translate the telescope’s infrared data into colorful visible light (<em>SN: 3/17/18, p. 4</em>).</p>



<p>The stunning photos that follow are a few of the early greatest hits from the shiny new observatory.</p>



<h4>Deep space</h4>

<p>JWST has captured the deepest views yet of the universe (above). Galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 (bluer galaxies) is 4.6 billion light-years from Earth. It acts as a giant cosmic lens, letting JWST zoom in on thousands of even more distant galaxies that shone 13 billion years ago (the redder, more stretched galaxies). The far-off galaxies look different in the mid-infrared light (above left) captured by the telescope’s MIRI instrument than they do in the near-infrared light (above right) captured by NIRCam.

<p>JWST was built to peer over vast cosmic distances, but it also provides new glimpses at our solar system neighbors. This <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptune-rings-new-image-james-webb-telescope">pic of Neptune</a> was the first close look at its delicate-looking rings in over 30 years (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 5</em>).</p>

<p>The rings in this astonishing image are not an optical illusion. They’re made of dust, and a new ring is added every eight years when the two stars in the center of the image come close to each other. One of the stars is a Wolf-Rayet star, which is in the final stages of its life and puffing out dust. The cyclical dusty eruptions allowed scientists to directly measure for the first time <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-stars-space-starlight-stardust-astronomy">how pressure from starlight pushes dust around</a> (<em>SN: 11/19/22, p. 6</em>).</p>

<p>With JWST’s unprecedented sensitivity, astronomers plan to compare the earliest galaxies with more modern galaxies to figure out how galaxies grow and evolve. This galactic smashup, whose main remnant is known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-cartwheel-galaxy-image">the Cartwheel galaxy</a>, shows a step in that epic process (<em>SN Online: 8/3/22</em>). The large central galaxy (right in the above composite) has been pierced through the middle by a smaller one that fled the scene (not in view). The Hubble Space Telescope previously snapped a visible light image of the scene (top half). But with its infrared eyes, JWST has revealed much more structure and complexity in the galaxy’s interior (bottom half).</p>

<p>The gas giant HIP 65426b was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">first exoplanet</a> to have its portrait taken by JWST&nbsp;(each inset shows the planet in a different wavelength of light; the star symbol shows the location of the planet’s parent star). This image, released by astronomer Sasha Hinkley and colleagues, doesn’t look like much compared with some of the other spectacular space vistas from JWST. But it will give clues to what the planet’s atmosphere is made of and shows the telescope’s potential for doing more of this sort of work on even smaller, rocky exoplanets (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 6</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brewing-yeast-ancestor-ireland-beer">The ancestor to modern brewing yeast has been found hiding in Ireland</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1516, the duchy of Bavaria in Germany imposed a law on its beer brewers meant to reserve ingredients like wheat and rye for the baking of bread. The decree restricted brewers to using only barley, hops, water and yeast to make their libations, and set the prices for beer depending on the time of year. The law inadvertently limited brewing to the winter, which favored a cold-tolerant yeast called <em>Saccharomyces pastorianus</em>, which brews lager, over the more common <em>S. cerevisiae, </em>which brews ale<em>.</em></p>



<p><em>S. pastorianus </em>is a hybrid, produced from the mating of <em>S. cerevisiae </em>with another yeast called <em>S. eubayanus</em>. Despite lager’s European origins, <em>S. eubayanus </em>hadn’t actually been found there and was only first discovered in 2011, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lagers-mystery-ingredient-found">in the Patagonia region of South America</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/11</em>). Now, thanks to a research project carried out by undergraduate students, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsyr/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/femsyr/foac053" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>S. eubayanus</em> has been found living in European soil</a> — fittingly, in the beer-loving nation of Ireland.</p>





<p>“Since the discovery of <em>S. eubayanus</em> [more than] 10 years ago, it’s been a fun puzzle putting together where the species is actually found,” says Quinn Langdon, a biologist at Stanford University, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>A leading theory is that <em>S. eubayanus</em> originated in Patagonia and then spread around the world, eventually mating with <em>S. cerevisiae </em>in European breweries to make <em>S. pastorianus</em>.</p>



<p>Geraldine Butler, a geneticist at University College Dublin and leader of the project, always thought that teaching genome-sequencing techniques by having students scour soils for yeast could turn up <em>S. eubayanus</em>. Still, she says, she couldn’t contain her excitement when she saw the first hint of the microbe. “I was sitting by the sequencer waiting for the results to come out,” she says.</p>



<p>One of Butler’s students, Stephen Allen, found two local strains of <em>S. eubayanus</em> hiding in plain sight on the Belfield campus of University College Dublin. The team has since gone back and found the yeast again, Butler says, suggesting that there is a stable population of the yeast living in the Irish soil.</p>



<p>The new discovery was published December 7 in <em>FEMS Yeast Research</em>.</p>



<p>Butler hopes this discovery will brew interest elsewhere in Europe to search for <em>S. eubayanus</em>, including in Bavaria, where lager brewing is thought to have first started. She is also looking for commercial partners to try making beer with the Irish strains.</p>



<p>Langdon isn’t confident that the new microbes will lead to tasty brews because there are other <em>S. eubayanus </em>strains that don’t grow well on maltose, the sugar that needs to be digested by yeasts during the brewing process. Still, Langdon says, “it’d be fun to brew with them.”</p>





<p>Whether the newly discovered Irish strains of <em>S. pastorianus</em>’ missing parent taste good or not, there’s no denying that their discovery helps solve a little piece of the puzzle of lager brewing’s origins. That 16th century shift from <em>S. cerevisiae</em> to <em>S. pastorianus</em> led to a global shift that continues to this day — more than 90 percent of beer sold worldwide today is lager.</p>



<p>Fungi are the “forgotten kingdom,” Langdon says, not getting as much attention as plants or animals, despite playing an outsize role in human history. “Yeasts are just single cells living in the soil, and they’re doing really important things.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ankylosaur-dinosaur-tail-club-bludgeon">Armored dinos may have used their tail clubs to bludgeon each other</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tanklike armored dinosaurs probably pummeled each other — not just predators — with huge, bony knobs attached to the ends of their tails. Thanks to new fossil findings, researchers are getting a clearer understanding of how these rugged plant eaters may have used their wicked weaponry.</p>



<p>Many dinosaurs known as ankylosaurids sported a heavy, potentially microwave-sized tail club. This natural sledgehammer has long been considered by both scientists and artists as a defensive weapon against predators, says Victoria Arbour, a paleontologist at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, Canada.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Fossil evidence for tail clubs’ targets was largely lacking, until Arbour and her colleagues chipped more rock away from the same skeleton they used to describe a new armored dinosaur, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dinosaur-resurrects-demon-ghostbusters"><em>Zuul crurivastator</em></a>, in 2017 <em>(SN: 6/12/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dinosaur had five broken spikes on its sides. The team&#8217;s statistical analyses showed the damaged spikes clustered in specific regions of the body. If a large carnivorous dinosaur made these injuries, says Arbour, they’d likely be more randomly distributed and include bite and scratch marks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, the injuries are <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more consistent with clubbing</a>, the researchers report December 7 in <em>Biology Letters.</em><br><br>Armored dinosaurs&#8217; tail clubs start out either absent or too tiny to mount a major defense, and they get proportionally larger with age. Similar growth patterns occur in some modern animal weaponry like antlers. It’s possible that tanklike dinosaurs sparred with each other for mates, food or territory much like male deer and giraffes do today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that tail could also be useful in a pinch. “Having a tail club you can swing around at the ankles of a two-legged predator is a pretty effective weapon,” says Arbour.</p>



<p>“Ankylosaurs are often portrayed as stupid, loner dinosaurs,” she adds. The findings “show that they probably had much more complex behaviors than we give them credit for.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orphan brings extensive business development, operations expertise, and relationship management experience to the role of program director. She joins arXiv from Portico, a not-for-profit digital preservation service. As director of content preservation and publisher relations there, she ensured ongoing growth and sustainability by engaging with Open Access publishers, university presses, national libraries, and other organizations around the world. She also served on the board of directors of the Open Access Scholarly Publishing Association and is an active member of the Society for Scholarly Publishing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At arXiv, Orphan’s role spans administrative management, operational oversight, and implementation of arXiv’s short- and long-term strategic goals. She also serves as a liaison between arXiv, its advisors, and the international open access community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stephanie’s operational management experience at Portico and her successes working with the scholarly publishing community will serve arXiv well,&#8221; said Ramin Zabih, arXiv’s faculty director. &#8220;As program director, Stephanie will play a key role in arXiv&#8217;s future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am so excited to be joining the team at arXiv,&#8221; said Orphan, who holds an M.S. in library and information science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an M.A. in English literature from the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. &#8220;As a seminal preprint server, arXiv has served a unique and important role in scientific scholarly communications for more than three decades, and it is an honor to play a role in its ongoing growth and success. I am eager to work alongside arXiv staff and stakeholders to ensure that arXiv serves the current and future needs of the research community.&#8221;</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wolves-parasite-pack-leader-toxoplasma-gondii">A parasite makes wolves more likely to become pack leaders</a></h4>

              
                <p>A parasite might be driving some wolves to lead or go solo.</p>



<p>Wolves in Yellowstone National Park infected with <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04122-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make more daring decisions</a> than their uninfected counterparts, researchers report November 24 in <em>Communications Biology</em>.&nbsp;The wolves’ enhanced risk-taking means they are more likely to leave their pack, or become leaders of their own.</p>



<p>“Those are two decisions that can really benefit wolves, or could cause wolves to die,” says Connor Meyer, a field biologist at the University of Montana in Missoula. The findings reveal a parasite’s potent ability to influence a wolf’s social fate.</p>



<p>Disease is often considered important for wildlife, mostly in the context of killing its host, Meyer says. “We have evidence now that just being infected with a certain parasite — <em>Toxoplasma</em> — can have pretty major implications for wolf behavior.”</p>

<p>Single-celled <em>T. gondii</em> has a track record of altering animal behavior. Its most important hosts are cats, which provide a breeding ground for the parasite in their small intestine. The parasite offspring hitch a ride on feline feces. Other animals then ingest the parasite, which then manipulates its new hosts’ behavior by tweaking certain hormones, making the hosts bolder or more aggressive. Infected mice, for example, can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parasite-makes-mice-unafraid-cats-may-quash-other-fears">fatally lose their fear of cats</a>, allowing the parasite to infect more hosts once the mice are consumed (<em>SN: 1/14/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Yellowstone National Park, many wolves are also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81192-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infected with <em>T. gondii</em></a>, recent research has shown.&nbsp;So Meyer and colleagues wondered if gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) in the park showed any parasite mind-bending of their own.</p>





<p>Wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995. Ongoing study of the park’s packs meant that the researchers had access to about 26 years’ worth of blood samples, behavioral observations and movement data for 229 of the park’s wolves.</p>



<p>The team screened the wolf blood for antibodies against <em>T. gondii</em> parasites, which reveal an infection. The researchers also noted which wolves left their pack — usually a family unit consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring — or became a pack leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both are high-stakes moves for a wolf, Meyer says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Infected wolves were 11 times as likely as noninfected wolves to disperse from their pack, the team found, and about 46 times as likely to eventually become leaders. The findings fit in with <em>T. gondii’</em>s apparent ability to boost boldness across a wide range of warm-blooded life.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The study fills a crucial gap in the <em>Toxoplasma</em> pool of knowledge, says Ajai Vyas, a neurobiologist at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>“Most of the earlier work has been done in the lab,” Vyas says. But there are limitations to that approach, especially for re-creating how animals experience the effects of the parasite in their natural environment. Such research has “become almost like studying whale swimming behavior in backyard pools; [it] does not work very well.”</p>



<p>Wolves’ enhanced boldness may even form a feedback loop, the team proposes. The researchers found that not only do cougars (<em>Puma concolor</em>) in the park carry the parasite, but wolves’ infection rates were highest when the animals’ ranges overlapped with the park’s densest aggregations of cougars. Infected wolf leaders may be more likely to bring pack members into riskier situations, including approaching cougar territories, making additional infections more likely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The feedback-loop idea is “very fascinating,” but more research is needed to confirm it, says Greg Milne, an epidemiologist at the Royal Veterinary College in London, who was not involved with the study. Such research may involve determining if infected wolves are more likely to migrate into an area with more cougars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think people are just starting to really appreciate that personality differences in animals are a major consideration in behavior,” says study coauthor Kira Cassidy, a wildlife biologist at the Yellowstone Wolf Project in Bozeman, Mont. “Now we add a parasite-impacting behavior to the list.”</p>



<p>Next, the team is interested in examining the long-term consequences of a <em>T. gondii</em> infection, and whether infected wolves make better leaders or dispersers than uninfected wolves.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It’s also not known how infection impacts survival and reproduction rates, Cassidy says. “Infection may very well be detrimental in some ways and advantageous in others.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780063097254" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pests</a><br><em>Bethany Brookshire</em><br><em>Ecco, $28.99</em></p>



<p>We spend so much time making sure wildlife stays away from us, whether that’s setting traps, building fences or putting out poisons. Sure, unwanted guests are annoying. But why do we consider some animals “pests”? It’s all about perspective, says science journalist Bethany Brookshire. “We can put poison out for rats and protest their use as laboratory animals. We can shoot deer in the fall and show their adorable offspring to our children in the spring,” she writes in her new book, <em>Pests: How Humans Create Animal Villains</em>.</p>





<p>Brookshire argues that we deem animals “pests” when we fear them (like snakes). Or when they thrive in a niche we unintentionally created for them (think rats in the New York subway). Or when they find a way to live in a habitat now dominated by humans (all those deer in the suburbs). Sometimes we demonize an animal if we feel like it’s threatening our ability to control the landscape (like coyotes that attack our livestock, pets and even children).</p>



<p>Through the lens of science, history, culture, religion, personal anecdotes and a big dose of humor, Brookshire breaks down how our perspective shapes our relationships with our animal neighbors. She also goes into the field — trailing rats, hunting pythons, taming feral cats, tracking drugged-up bears — to see firsthand how pests are treated.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Brookshire, a former staff writer for <em>Science News for Students</em> (now <em>Science News Explores</em>), about what we can learn from pests and how we can co­exist with them. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What inspired you to write this book?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> I wrote a news story that was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/how-house-mouse-tamed-itself">about mice living with humans</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/17</em>). [It was based on a study] showing that we’ve had house mice since we’ve had houses. I love the fact that humans have had these other animals taking advantage of the ecosystems that we create basically since we started living settled life. Every location that has humans has their “rat.” Sometimes that’s a rat, and sometimes it’s a pigeon or a cockatoo or a lizard or a horse. It’s not about what these animals are doing. Animals live in ecosystems that we create, and we hate animals that live too close.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What surprised you during your research?</strong></p>





<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> The reflexiveness of people’s responses [to pests]. People respond emotionally. When you make them pause and think about it, they go, “Oh wow, that doesn’t make any sense. I should not be caught trying to kill a raccoon with a sword.” But in the moment, you’re so wrapped up in the violation of what you see as your personal space.</p>



<p>The other thing is the extent to which our disdain of pests is wrapped up in social justice. A lot of times we see this hatred and disgust for animals that we see as “low class.” High-class people don’t have rats. And that’s really about social justice, about infrastructure and the ability of people to live in clean houses, store their food properly or even have a house at all.</p>



<p>Also, the way we deal with these animals often has vestiges of colonialism, as in the chapter on elephants. [In Kenya, European colonists] made people grow corn and sugarcane, which elephants love. Colonization created national park systems that assumed that humans had no place in wilderness, shoving out Indigenous pastoralists. Colonization created the market for poached ivory. And colonizing people assumed that Indigenous people did not like elephants or know their benefits. We are living with the consequences. Many modern efforts at elephant protection are spearheaded by Western people, and they assume the biggest issue with elephants is poaching and that Indigenous people don’t know what’s best for themselves or the elephants. In fact, human-elephant conflict [which includes elephant crop raids] is the far bigger problem, and Indigenous people have a long history of coexisting with elephants.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: In the book, you looked at many different cultures and included Indigenous voices.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> It’s important to realize there’s more than one way to look at the world. By learning from other cultures, it helps us understand our biases. It’s only when you get outside of your own beliefs that you realize that’s not just the way things are.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: That shows up when you write about the Karni Mata Temple in India, also known as the Temple of Rats. Temple rats are not treated as pests, but a rat in a house would be.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> That’s the result of context. And you see that in Western cultures all the time. People love squirrels. Well, they’re basically rats with better PR. Then you have people who have pet rats, who would probably scream if a sewer rat ran by.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Are there any animals that you consider a pest?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> No. The animal that I’ve probably come away with the most negative impression of is humans. It’s funny because we think we can extinct anything. And I love how these animals have gone: “Oh, poison? That’s cute.” “Oh, a trap? You’re funny.” We’ve tried to use electric fences on elephants [to stop them from eating crops]. And elephants are like, “Guess what? Ivory doesn’t conduct electricity.” Even if they don’t have tusks, elephants just pick up a log [to destroy the fence].</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Are you hoping to change people’s minds about pests? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> I hope that they will ask why they respond to pests the way they do. Instead of just going, “This animal bothers me,” ask why, and does it make sense. I also hope it opens more curiosity about the animals around us. I learned from Indigenous groups just how much knowledge they have of the animals in their ecosystem. I hope more people learn. A world that you know a lot about is just a better world to live in.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/natural-gene-drive-invasive-rodents-extinction-island">A natural gene drive could steer invasive rodents on islands to extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the battle against the invasive house mouse on islands, scientists are using the rodent’s own genes against it.</p>



<p>With the right tweaks, introducing a few hundred genetically altered mice could <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2213308119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive an island’s invasive mouse population to extinction</a> in about 25 years, researchers report in the Nov. 15 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The trick is adding the changes to a section of mouse DNA that gets inherited far more often than it should.</p>





<p>Scientists have been creating similar extra-inheritable genes — called gene drives — in the lab. The chunks are designed to get passed on to most or all of an animal’s offspring instead of the usual half, and make those offspring infertile in the bargain. Scientists have used gene drives to reduce populations of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-extermination-top-science-stories-2018-yir">mosquitoes</a> and fruit flies (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>).</p>



<p>But mammals are a different story. Scientists have previously synthesized a gene drive that gets passed on in mice about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-drive-mice-p">80 percent of the time</a> (<em>SN: 1/23/19</em>). But the drive isn’t strong enough to stop a population quickly.</p>



<p>Luckily, nature has it handled. A haplotype is a naturally occurring group of genes that gets passed on as a unit during replication. The genome of the house mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>) has a particular haplotype, called the <em>t </em>haplotype, that gets passed on to offspring more than 95 percent of the time, instead of the typical 50 percent.</p>



<p>This natural gene drive has benefits, says Anna Lindholm, a biologist at the University of Zurich who was not involved in the study. It “evolved naturally and continues to be present in the wild, and we have as yet not found resistance to it in wild populations,” she says. It’s also not found in species besides <em>M. musculus,</em> meaning it probably won’t spread to other noninvasive mice.</p>



<p>Molecular biologist Paul Thomas and his colleagues decided to target the <em>t</em> haplotype with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-inspires-new-tricks-edit-genes">the cut-and-paste molecular tool called CRISPR/Cas9</a> (<em>SN: 8/24/16</em>). They used CRISPR to insert the gene sequence for the CRISPR tool itself into the <em>t </em>haplotype. When a male mouse carrying the altered <em>t</em> haplotype mates with a female, the inserted genes for the CRISPR tool spring into action. It uses a special genetic guide to target and inactivate the gene for the hormone prolactin — rendering any baby female mice infertile.</p>



<p>The best part is that the natural <em>t </em>haplotype can also sterilize males, says Thomas, of the University of Adelaide in Australia. Males with two copies — homozygous males — won’t reproduce at all. </p>



<p>“If you could get a <em>t</em> to spread through a population, you could get homozygous males being sterile,” he says. “And with the addition of the CRISPR element on top of that, we get homozygous females that are also sterile.”</p>





<p>To find out how well the <em>t</em> haplotype mice do on an island where mice are wreaking havoc on biodiversity, the scientists used a computer simulation of an island with 200,000 mice. The team found that adding just 256 mice with the CRISPR-altered <em>t</em> haplotype could successfully drive the mouse population to zero in around 25 years. Even without CRISPR, adding mice with the normal <em>t </em>haplotype could tank the population in about 43 years.</p>



<p>But models aren’t mice. In a final test, Thomas and his colleagues made the model reality. The team altered the <em>t</em> haplotype in a small group of mice in the lab and used genetic tests to show that those mice would pass on their new genetics 95 percent of the time.</p>



<p>“This is a clever idea, to build on the <em>t</em> haplotype natural drive system and use CRISPR, not for spreading the construct, but for damaging genes necessary for female fertility,” Lindholm says. “This is a big advance in the development of new tools to control invasive mouse populations.”</p>



<p>The next step, Thomas says, will be to test the effects in real populations of mice in secure enclosures, to find out if the genetically tweaked <em>t </em>can stop mice from reproducing. The scientists also want to ensure that any engineered mice released into the wild have some safety mechanism in place, so other mice elsewhere remain unaffected. </p>



<p>The final version might target tiny mutations that only occur on one island where the pest population is isolated, Thomas suggests. If the mouse escaped onto the mainland, its altered genes would have no effect on the local mice. The scientists also want to consult with people living in the area, as officials did when genetically modified mosquitoes were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">released in Florida</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>Finally, he notes, 25 years is a long wait for some endangered island populations. “We would love to see CRISPR work faster,” he says. “It’s still a work in progress.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/escaideb-300x95-1-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>I attended during 24-26 November 2022 to the European Scientific Conference on Applied Infectious Disease Epidemiology (ESCAIDE), organized and hosted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm during 24 – 26 November 2022. The conference was conducted in a hybrid mode, where a total of 500 and 2,400 persons attended in-person and online, respectively.</p>
<p>Here I share my impressions from the conference:</p>
<p>The first important topic was about <strong>Ethics</strong>: Alena Buyx, president of the German Ethics Council discussed about ethical boundaries and reminded us of the importance of keeping ethics in mind for future pandemics. She referenced the famous Ethicist Ross Upshur who said “The lesson we have learned is that we do not like to learn lessons” as he described we had learned a lot from the previous outbreaks and pandemics. Also, we need to focus more on vulnerability and resilience (for example to protect elderly people early on). We need to be more tolerant of uncertainties: for epidemiologists, we deal with risks in different specialties, but the public does not know it; therefore we need to keep a sense of togetherness. In the future, we need to include ethics in the process of policymaking, and we need to have ethically responsible tools of preparedness while keeping the option for civil society to be involved in the response to pandemics, which was already shown in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/18/9765">a study by Driesen <em>et al.</em></a> in Germany.</p>
<p>The topic of the COVID-19 pandemic has complicated the responses to an already complex situation of the intersection between climate, conflicts and socioeconomic risks, in combination with rising food insecurity and displacement. Therefore the number of refugees is increasing and the funding to support them is decreasing. There is an emerging inequity in funding channeling to the global refugee situation. This will be a public health concern in the near future.</p>

<p>The topic of communication took a large part of the conference. The COVID19 pandemic moved very fast and therefore we need to invest more in communication with the public. The internet and social media made us realize that the so-called geographical borders are just political or “human-made” and the world has become as a single country. Also, we need to focus more on how we communicate scientific messages to the public. How do we make sure we are proactive in risk communication?, incidentally this topic was also reported by <a href="https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-022-00857-x">an international study by Cristea <em>et al</em></a>.</p>
<p>The topic of “One Health” was of importance as well, with emphasis on the power of working together as different disciplines. This will be a key element for the preparedness for the second pandemic and dealing with the consequences of climate change.</p>
<p>Finally, COVID19 has pushed different scientific methods to scale their work and to be innovative on how to work at a much faster pace. For example, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing and genome sequencing has increased by several folds post-COVID19.</p>
<p>Finally, I was lucky to interview Dr. Andrea Ammon, the director of ECDC who shared her take-home message from ESCAIDE to the world:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-fire-hominid-cave-human-evolution">Homo naledi may have lit fires in underground caves at least 236,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>An ancient hominid dubbed <em>Homo naledi</em> may have lit controlled fires in the pitch-dark chambers of an underground cave system, new discoveries hint.</p>



<p>Researchers have found <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/december-1-future-exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remnants of small fireplaces and sooty wall and ceiling smudges</a> in passages and chambers throughout South Africa’s Rising Star cave complex, paleoanthropologist Lee Berger announced in a December 1 lecture hosted by the Carnegie Institution of Science in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>“Signs of fire use are everywhere in this cave system,” said Berger, of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.</p>





<p><em>H. naledi</em> presumably lit the blazes in the caves since remains of no other hominids have turned up there, the team says. But the researchers have yet to date the age of the fire remains.&nbsp;And researchers outside Berger’s group have yet to evaluate the new finds.</p>



<p><em>H. naledi </em>fossils date to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans">between 335,000 and 236,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 5/9/17</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim">around the time<em> Homo sapiens</em> originated</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/17</em>). Many researchers suspect that regular use of fire by hominids for light, warmth and cooking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ashes-oldest-controlled-fire">began roughly 400,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 4/2/12</em>).</p>



<p>Such behavior has not been attributed to <em>H. naledi</em> before, largely because of its small brain. But it’s now clear that a brain roughly one-third the size of human brains today still enabled <em>H. naledi</em> to achieve control of fire, Berger contends.</p>



<p>Last August, Berger climbed down a narrow shaft and examined two underground chambers where <em>H. naledi</em> fossils had been found. He noticed stalactites and thin rock sheets that had partly grown over older ceiling surfaces. Those surfaces displayed blackened, burned areas and were also dotted by what appeared to be soot particles, Berger said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, expedition codirector and Wits paleoanthropologist Keneiloe Molopyane led excavations of a nearby cave chamber. There, the researchers uncovered two small fireplaces containing charred bits of wood, and burned bones of antelopes and other animals. Remains of a fireplace and nearby burned animal bones were then discovered in a more remote cave chamber where <em>H. naledi</em> fossils have been found, Berger said.</p>



<p>Still, the main challenge for investigators will be to date the burned wood and bones and other fire remains from the Rising Star chambers and demonstrate that the material comes from the same sediment layers as <em>H. naledi</em> fossils, says paleoanthropologist W. Andrew Barr of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>





<p>“That’s an absolutely critical first step before it will be possible to speculate about who may have made fires for what reason,” Barr says.</p>



<p>Bone, wood and charcoal from the South African site should also be examined with various techniques to determine whether darkened areas resulted from burning or mineral staining, says Harvard University archaeologist Sarah Hlubik, who wasn&#8217;t involved in the research. And a careful analysis of the layout of remains in the Rising Star chambers, she adds, will indicate whether Berger’s group discovered small fireplaces built by cave visitors, or only bones and other material that washed into the cave system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-evolution-supercomputer-animation-stars-galaxies">A new supercomputer simulation animates the evolution of the universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>The infant universe transforms from a featureless landscape to an intricate web in a new supercomputer simulation of the cosmos’s formative years.</p>



<p>An animation from the simulation shows our universe changing from a smooth, cold gas cloud to the lumpy scattering of galaxies and stars that we see today. It’s the most complete, detailed and accurate <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/516/3/3389/6675818?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproduction of the universe’s evolution</a> yet produced, researchers report in the November <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>





<p>This virtual glimpse into the cosmos’s past is the result of CoDaIII, the third iteration of the Cosmic Dawn Project, which traces the history of the universe, beginning with the “cosmic dark ages” about 10 million years after the Big Bang. At that point, hot gas produced at the very beginning of time, about 13.8 billion years ago, had cooled to a featureless cloud devoid of light, says astronomer Paul Shapiro of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>

</div><figcaption>The universe was a cold, dark place 10 million years after the Big Bang. Hydrogen gas began to clump together 100 million years later, forming dense regions (white) that gave birth to the first stars and galaxies, as seen in this animation from a new simulation of the early universe. Light radiating from the stars (blue) heated the gas around the galaxies as matter collected in a weblike arrangement. The pink bursts are high-temperature regions that appeared as some stars exploded. The galaxies and stars we see today lie along the filaments that resulted from the complicated interplay between matter and starlight as the universe evolved.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Roughly 100 million years later, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/past-according-planck-cosmologists-got-lot-right">tiny ripples in the gas left over from the Big Bang</a> caused the gases to clump together (<em>SN: 2/19/15</em>). This led to long, threadlike strands that formed a web of matter where galaxies and stars were born.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;As radiation from the early galaxies illuminated the universe, it ripped electrons from atoms in the once-cold gas clouds during a period called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/faint-distant-galaxies-may-have-driven-early-universe-makeover">epoch of reionization</a>, which continued until about 700 million years after the Big Bang (<em>SN: 2/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>CoDaIII is the first simulation to fully account for the complicated interaction between radiation and the flow of matter in the universe, Shapiro says. It spans the time from the cosmic dark ages and through the next several billion years as the distribution of matter in the modern universe formed.</p>



<p>The animation from the simulation, Shapiro says, graphically shows how the structure of the early universe is “imprinted on the galaxies today, which remember their youth, or their birth or their ancestors from the epoch of reionization.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sale-t-rex-fossil-big-loss-science-dinosaur">Why the sale of a T. rex fossil could be a big loss for science</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> isn’t just a king to paleontologists — the dinosaur increasingly reigns over the world of art auctions. A nearly complete skeleton known as Stan the <em>T. rex</em> smashed records in October 2020 when a bidding war drove its price to $31.8 million, the highest ever paid for any fossil. Before that, Sue the <em>T. rex</em> held the top spot; it went for $8.3 million in 1997.</p>



<p>That kind of publicity — and cachet — means that <em>T. rex</em>’s value is sky-high, and the dinosaur continues to have its teeth firmly sunk into the auction world in 2022. In December, Maximus, a <em>T. rex</em> skull, will be the centerpiece of a Sotheby’s auction in New York City. It’s expected to sell for about $15 million.</p>



<p>Another <em>T. rex fossil </em>named Shen was anticipated to sell for between $15 million and $25 million at a Christie’s auction in Hong Kong in late November. However, the auction house pulled it over concerns about the number of replica bones used in the fossil.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-800x450.jpg" alt="A photo of T. rex skeleton in a running position on a black background" class="wp-image-3119478" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-1030x580.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-1380x776.jpg 1380w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3119478">Shen (pictured) was slated to be the first <em>T. rex</em> fossil ever sold at auction in Asia, with an expected price of $15 million to $25 million. That auction was withdrawn due to questions over the number of replica bones in the fossil.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119478">Marcus Müller-Witte, M.A./Courtesy of Christie&#8217;s</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“These are astronomical sums of money, really surprising sums of money,” says Donna Yates, a criminologist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who studies high-value collectibles.</p>



<p>Stan’s final price “was completely unexpected,” Yates says. The fossil was originally appraised at about $6 million — still a very large sum, though nothing like the final tally, which was the result of a three-way bidding war.</p>





<p>But the staggering amounts of money <em>T. rex</em> fossils now fetch at auction can mean a big loss for science. At those prices, the public institutions that might try to claim these glimpses into the deep past are unable to compete with deep-pocketed private buyers, researchers say.</p>



<p>One reason for the sky-high prices may be that <em>T. rex</em> fossils are increasingly being treated more like rare works of art than bits of scientific evidence, Yates says. The bones might once have been bought and sold at dusty “cowboy fossil” dealerships. But nowadays these fossils are on display in shiny gallery spaces and are being appraised and marketed as rare objets d’art. That’s appealing to collectors, she adds: “If you’re a high-value buyer, you’re a person who wants the finest things.”</p>



<p>But fossils’ true value is the information they hold, says Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis. “They are our only means of understanding the biology and evolution of extinct animals.”</p>



<p>Keeping fossils of <em>T. rex </em>and other dinosaurs and animals in public repositories, such as museums, ensures that scientists have consistent access to study the objects, including being able to replicate or reevaluate previous findings. But a fossil sold into private or commercial hands is subject to the whim of its owner — which means anything could happen to it at any time, Carr says.</p>





<p>“It doesn’t matter if [a <em>T. rex</em> fossil] is bought by some oligarch in Russia who says scientists can come and study it,” he says. “You might as well take a sledgehammer to it and destroy it.”</p>



<h4>A desire for one’s own <em>T. rex</em></h4>



<p>There are only about 120 known specimens of <em>T. rex</em> in the world. At least half of them are owned privately and aren’t available to the public. That loss is “wreaking havoc on our dataset. If we don’t have a good sample size, we can’t claim to know anything about [<em>T. rex</em>],” Carr says.</p>



<p>For example, to be able to tell all the ways that <em>T. rex </em>males differed from females, researchers need between 70 and 100 good specimens for statistically significant analyses, an amount scientists don’t currently have.</p>



<p>Similarly, scientists know little about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/small-cousins-tyrannosaurus-rex-may-have-actually-been-growing-teenagers">how <em>T. rex</em> grew</a>, and studying fossils of youngsters could help (<em>SN: 1/6/20</em>). But only a handful of juvenile <em>T. rex</em> specimens are publicly available to researchers. That number would double if private specimens were included.</p>



<p>Museums and academic institutions typically don’t have the kind of money it takes to compete with private bidders in auctions or any such competitive sales. That’s why, in the month before Stan went up for auction in 2020, the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology, or SVP, <a href="https://vertpaleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SVP-letter-to-Christies-Auction-House.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a letter to Christie’s</a> asking the auction house to consider restricting bidding to public institutions. The hope was that this would give scientists a fighting chance to obtain the specimens.</p>



<p>But the request was ignored — and unfortunately may have only increased publicity for the sale, says Stuart Sumida, a paleontologist at California State University in San Bernardino and SVP’s current vice president. That’s why SVP didn’t issue a public statement this time ahead of the auctions for Shen and Maximus, Sumida says, though the organization continues to strongly condemn fossil sales — whether of large, dramatic specimens or less well-known creatures. “All fossils are data. Our position is that selling fossils is not scientific and it damages science.”</p>



<p>Sumida is particularly appalled at statements made by auction houses that suggest the skeletons “have already been studied,” an attempt to reassure researchers that the data contained in that fossil won’t be lost, regardless of who purchases it. That’s deeply misleading, he says, because of the need for reproducibility, as well as the always-improving development of new analysis techniques. “When they make public statements like that, they are undermining not only paleontology, but the scientific process as well.”</p>



<p>And the high prices earned by Stan and Sue are helping to drive the market skyward, not only for other <em>T. rex</em> fossils but also for less famous species. “It creates this ripple effect that is incredibly damaging to science in general,” Sumida says. Sotheby’s, for example, auctioned off a <em>Gorgosaurus</em>, a <em>T. rex</em> relative, in July for $6.1 million. In May, a <em>Deinonychus antirrhopus</em> — the inspiration for <em>Jurassic Park</em>’s velociraptor — was sold by Christie’s for $12.4 million.</p>



<h4>Protecting <em>T. rex</em> from collectors</h4>



<p>Compounding the problem is the fact that the United States has no protections in place for fossils unearthed from the backyards or dusty fields of private landowners. The U.S. is home to just about every <em>T. rex</em> skeleton ever found. Stan, Sue and Maximus hail from the Black Hills of South Dakota. Shen was found in Montana.</p>



<p>As of 2009, U.S. law prohibits collecting scientifically valuable fossils, particularly fossils of vertebrate species like <em>T. rex</em>, from public lands without permits. But fossils found on private lands are still considered the landowner’s personal property. And landowners can grant digging access to whomever they wish.</p>

<p>Before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-13-details-custody-battle-largest-t-rex">the discovery of Sue the <em>T. rex</em></a> (<em>SN: 9/6/14</em>), private owners often gave scientific institutions free access to hunt for fossils on their land, says Bridget Roddy, currently a researcher at the legal news company Bloomberg Law in Washington, D.C. But in the wake of Sue’s sale in 1997, researchers began to have to compete for digging access with commercial fossil hunters.</p>



<p>These hunters can afford to pay landowners large sums for the right to dig, or even a share of the profits from fossil sales. And many of these commercial dealers sell their finds at auction houses, where the fossils can earn far more than most museums are able to pay.</p>



<p>Lack of federal protections for paleontological resources found on private land — combined with the large available supply of fossils — is a situation unique to the United States, Roddy says. Fossil-rich countries such as China, Canada, Italy and France consider any such finds to be under government protection, part of a national legacy.</p>



<p>In the United States, seizing such materials from private landowners — under an eminent domain argument — would require the government to pay “just compensation” to the landowners. But using eminent domain to generally protect such fossils wouldn’t be financially sustainable for the government, Roddy says, not least because most fossils dug up aren’t of great scientific value anyway.</p>



<p>There may be other, more grassroots ways to at least better regulate fossil sales, she says. While still a law student at DePaul University in Chicago, Roddy <a href="https://scholarship.law.tamu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1200&amp;context=journal-of-property-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined some of those ideas</a> in an article published in <em>Texas A&amp;M Journal of Property Law</em> in May.</p>



<p>One option, she suggests, is for states to create a selective sales tax attached to fossil purchases, specifically for buyers who intend to keep their purchases in private collections that are not readily available to the public. It’s “similar to if you want to buy a pack of cigarettes, which is meant to offset the harm that buying cigarettes does to society in general,” Roddy says. That strategy could be particularly effective in states with large auction houses, like New York.</p>



<p>Another possibility is to model any new, expanded fossil preservation laws on existing U.S. antiquities laws, intended to preserve cultural heritage. After all, Roddy says, fossils aren’t just bones, but they’re also part of the human story. “Fossils have influenced our folklore; they’re a unifier of humanity and culture rather than a separate thing.”</p>



<p>Though fossils from private lands aren’t protected, many states do impose restrictions on searches for archaeological and cultural artifacts, by requiring those looking for antiquities to restore excavated land or by fining the excavation of certain antiquities without state permission. Expanding those restrictions to fossil hunting, perhaps by requiring state approval through permits, could also give states the opportunity to purchase any significant finds before they’re lost to private buyers.</p>



<h4>Preserving fossils for science and the public</h4>



<p>Such protections could be a huge boon to paleontologists, who may not even know what’s being lost. “The problem is, we’ll never know” all the fossils that are being sold, Sumida says. “They’re shutting scientists out of the conversation.”</p>



<p>And when it comes to dinosaurs, “so many of the species we know about are represented by a single fossil,” says Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. “If that fossil was never found, or disappeared into the vault of a collector, then we wouldn’t know about that dinosaur.”</p>



<p>Or, he says, sometimes a particularly complete or beautifully preserved dinosaur skeleton is found, and without it, “we wouldn’t be able to study what that dinosaur looked like, how it moved, what it ate, how it sensed its world, how it grew.”</p>



<p>The point isn’t to put restrictions on collecting fossils so much as making sure they remain in public view, Brusatte adds. “There’s nothing as magical as finding your own fossils, being the first person ever to see something that lived millions of years ago.” But, he says, unique and scientifically invaluable fossils such as dinosaur skeletons should be placed in museums “where they can be conserved and studied and inspire the public, rather than in the basements or yachts of the oligarch class.”</p>



<p>After its record-breaking sale, Stan vanished for a year and a half, its new owners a mystery. Then in March 2022, news surfaced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/arts/design/stan-t-rex-abu-dhabi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fossil had been bought by the United Arab Emirates</a>, which stated it intends to place Stan in a new natural history museum.</p>

<p>Sue, too, is on public view. The fossil is housed at <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/sue-t-rex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History</a>, thanks to the pooled financial resources of the Walt Disney Corporation, the McDonald Corporation, the California State University System and others. That’s the kind of money it took to get the highest bid on a <em>T. rex</em> 25 years ago.</p>



<p>And those prices only seem to be going up. Researchers got lucky with Sue, and possibly Stan.</p>



<p>As for Shen, the fossil’s fate remains in limbo: It was pulled from auction not due to outcry from paleontologists, but over concerns about intellectual property rights. The fossil, at 54 percent complete, may have been supplemented with a polyurethane cast of bones from Stan, according to representatives of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, S.D. That organization, which discovered Stan, retains a copyright over the skeleton.</p>



<p>In response to those concerns, Christie’s pulled the lot, and now says that it intends to loan the fossil to a museum. But this move doesn’t reassure paleontologists. “A lot of people are pleased that the sale didn’t go through,” Sumida says. “But it sort of just kicks the can down the road.… It doesn’t mean they’re not going to try and sell it in another form, somewhere down the road.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, scientists simply can’t count on every important fossil finding its way to the public, Carr says. “Those fossils belong in a museum; it’s right out of <em>Indiana Jones</em>,” he says. “It’s not like they’re made in a factory somewhere. Fossils are nonrenewable resources. Once Shen is gone, it’s gone.”</p>
