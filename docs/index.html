<p>Clarivate has removed the mega-journal <em>Cureus</em> from its Master Journal List, according to the October update, <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/collection-list-downloads">released today</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move means <em>Cureus </em>will no longer be indexed in Web of Science or receive an impact factor. As we have reported, it can also mean researchers are <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">less likely to submit</a> to the journal, given universities rely on such metrics to judge researchers’ work for tenure and promotion decisions.</p>



<p>Clarivate put indexing for the journal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/30/web-of-science-puts-mega-journals-cureus-and-heliyon-on-hold/">on hold last September</a> for concerns about article quality, which the journal has been <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/24/cureus-its-reviewing-and-its-scholarly-impact-quotient/">criticized for</a> in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133190"></span>



<p>Cureus has retracted about <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">125 papers</a> since Springer Nature <a href="https://www.cureus.com/newsroom/news/159">acquired the title</a> in late 2022. Last year, the journal closed six of its academic channels critics described as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/21/mega-journal-cureus-kicks-out-organizations-critics-called-paper-mills/">dressed-up paper mills</a>, and has had to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/23/journal-retracts-article-for-plagiarized-images-after-trying-to-gag-researcher-who-complained/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/30/cureus-retracts-paper-for-plagiarism-following-retraction-watch-inquiries/">retract</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/05/cureus-reviewing-paper-alleged-to-plagiarize-lancet-article/">plagiarized</a> articles, as we’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=cureus">previously reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August, <em>Cureus</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/29/mega-journal-cureus-halts-author-peer-reviewer-suggestions/">eliminated author suggestions</a> for peer reviewers in an attempt to decrease potential conflicts of interest. The journal has had authorship issues in the past, as we’ve previously reported. In 2021, a medical resident in New Jersey <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/03/19/meet-the-medical-resident-who-had-his-wife-peer-review-five-of-his-papers/">invited his wife</a> to review his papers without disclosing their relationship, resulting in five retractions. In 2019, another author <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/04/11/an-author-was-accused-of-faking-peer-reviews-turns-out-he-also-falsified-two-images/">faked reviewer accounts</a> for two well-known neurosurgeons and was discovered only after a routine editorial audit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rebecca Krahenbuhl, a communications manager at Clarivate, told us a journal is removed from the Master Journals List when it “no longer meets” 24 quality criteria. These criteria include appropriate citations, adequate and effective peer review, and primarily original scholarly content, according to the <a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/web-of-science-core-collection/editorial-selection-process/journal-evaluation-process-selection-criteria/">company’s website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Krahenbuhl also told us journals are typically on hold for an average of around six weeks, but in cases where publishers “engage” with Clarivate, the company allows journals to remain on hold for longer “to allow time for publishers to conduct their own investigations and take corrective action should they decide to do so.”</p>



<p>Graham Parker-Finger, the publishing director at <em>Cureus</em>, told us the journal was “very disappointed” in Clarivate’s decision and noted the journal would continue “to offer fast, affordable, trusted and quality-assured publishing for the global medical community.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cureus.com/users/11-john-r-adler-jr-">John Adler Jr</a>., the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal, acknowledged our request for comment, and noted his nearly 16-year tenure as editor-in-chief would be ending this year. In<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-adler-1875b95_httpslnkdingknj-dyx-the-difficulties-activity-7388269231550849024-QJe9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAByWXIBtsn0tXWeQa9YSfv4kSeHd4MCfrg"> a LinkedIn post</a> dated October 26, Adler linked to <a href="https://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/abstract/9900/global_trends_in_the_neurosurgical_literature__a.1921.aspx">an analysis of neurosurgery papers</a> by country income group and wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The journal industry uses an &#8220;aura&#8221; of intellectual exclusivity to protect its obscene profits. Journals protect their business franchize [sic] through both excessively complex editorial processes (WOS, COPE), which notably lack any evidence of social benefit, and high prices, which in combination disadvantage authors from developing countries. Nothing scares the journal world more than democratizing journals. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

                Menopause is an important and inevitable life stage for most women; however, until recently, there was no research looking into how autistic women experience menopause. Do they experience it differently from neurotypical women? Do they have different symptoms, or do they have more severe symptoms? To investigate this, I conducted a systematic review with the aim of collecting and analysing the existing research and highlighting areas for further study.

<p>At the University of Technology in Baghdad,<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/17/exclusive-iraqi-university-forcing-students-to-cite-its-journals-to-graduate/"> students must publish papers citing the school’s own journals</a> if they wish to graduate, as we reported earlier this month. But down the road at<a href="https://uomustansiriyah.edu.iq/"> Mustansiriyah University</a>, one of Iraq’s <a href="https://www.scimagoir.com/rankings.php?sector=Higher+educ.&amp;country=IRQ">highest-ranked institutions</a>, researchers are facing even steeper citation requirements, according to new evidence we obtained.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3_09182025_publish-citation-reqts-Mustansiriyah-University.jpg">In a letter</a> (in Arabic) sent to the school’s six research centers on September 18, the university council requires researchers to be first authors on at least two “of the legal minimum of three research papers” they must publish every year.</p>



<p>Each of these papers must cite at least three articles other faculty members at the school have published in Scopus-indexed journals, as well as one or more articles in the university’s own publications.</p>



<span id="more-133185"></span>



<p>Doing so will contribute “to raising the level of research output and enhancing the university’s position in respected international publications,” according to the council, the school’s highest authority.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stuartmacdonald.uk.com/">Stuart Macdonald</a>, a visiting professor at the University of Leicester in England who has written about<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/05390184221142218"> citation gaming</a>, called the requirement “a new low.”</p>



<p>”Citation coercion is usually more subtle than this,” he told us. ”Perhaps Mustansiriyah University should be congratulated for being so open in its compulsory corruption.”</p>



<p>The newsletter Fraud Factor<a href="https://fraudfactor.substack.com/p/leaked-documents-reveal-systemic"> posted a translation</a> of the letter today, as well as additional documents on citation requirements for postgraduate students.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mustansiriyah-University-citation-reqts-sabbaticals.pdf">Another document</a> we obtained from Mustansiriyah’s College of Engineering sets out identical citation requirements for academics on research sabbaticals. In return for fulfilling the publication requirements, researchers will receive a letter of appreciation from the dean, the document adds. Such letters can earn faculty members extra points on their yearly evaluations, according to an Iraqi academic, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.</p>



<p>Mustansiriyah University did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Iraq has been on<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/dr-alaboudi-iraq-concludes-education-2025-conference-with-strategic-agreement-with-clarivate-amp-announcement-of-its-achievements-in-times-higher-education-world-university-rankings-2025-10-13-20"> a mission</a> to boost the rankings of<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/higher-education-thirtysix-iraqi-universities-obtain-top-scores-in-qs-arab-region-university-rankings-2026-2025-10-16-21"> its universities</a> and<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/during-1st-conference-of-editorial-boards-of-scientific-journals-dr-alaboudi-confirms-doubling-presence-of-iraqi-university-journals-in-international-publications-2025-09-10-19"> scientific journals</a>, which are increasingly<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/post/higher-education-announces-qualitative-achievement-with-rise-in-citescore-index-for-iraqi-journals-in-scopus-database-2025-07-08-23"> getting indexed</a> in influential international databases. Two of Mustansiriyah’s publications – the<a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijhm/pages/default.aspx"> <em>Iraqi Journal of Hematology</em></a> and the<a href="https://jeasd.uomustansiriyah.edu.iq/index.php/jeasd/about"> <em>Journal of Engineering and Sustainable Development</em></a> – are included in Elsevier’s Scopus, and the former also appears in Clarivate’s Emerging Sources Citation Index.</p>



<p>University rankings, which are often used for advertising, are tied to citation and publication counts. Many rely on Scopus data. While author self-cites are typically excluded, self-citation by institutions is not.</p>



<p>In a country where <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/09/deputy-minister-in-iraq-losing-papers-with-signs-of-paper-mill-involvement/">little or no funding is available</a> to do research, coercive citation may be less of a problem than the mere requirement for publications.</p>



<p>Some researchers “might become really afraid of getting fired, for example, because there is a pressure on them to publish,” said<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lokman-meho-72441131/?originalSubdomain=lb"> Lokman Meho</a>, a university librarian and professor at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, who has developed <a href="https://sites.aub.edu.lb/lmeho/ri2/about/">an index</a> to flag potential research-integrity problems at universities.</p>



<p>“They will do all it takes, even if it is cheating, even if it is unethical, to meet those requirements,” Meho said. “So this is where the government and the universities are incentivizing and forcing people to do unethical things.”</p>

<p>Six years after researchers called for the retraction of more than 400 papers about organ transplantation amid suspicion the organs used in the studies came from executed Chinese prisoners, journals are still working to clear the record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/15/journals-have-retracted-or-flagged-more-than-40-papers-from-china-that-appear-to-have-used-organ-transplants-from-executed-prisoners/">more than 40 papers were retracted or otherwise flagged shortly after the </a><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/2/e024473">2019 study was published</a>, by our count, only 44 of the 445 papers have been retracted to date. At least 17 of the articles marked with expressions of concern in 2019-2020 remain as such. </p>



<p>The analysis, published in <em>BMJ Open</em>, found more than 400 studies of organ transplants in China that didn’t report whether the sources gave their consent for donation, nor assurances the organs involved did not come from executed prisoners. As reported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/06/call-for-retraction-of-400-scientific-papers-amid-fears-organs-came-from-chinese-prisoners">by <em>The Guardian</em></a> in 2019, the study exposed “a mass failure of English language medical journals to comply with international ethical standards in place to ensure organ donors provide consent for transplantation.”&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDn8mkmWqIwC6fPt6bie0u2KNjQEs3u3t2KG7CwBnX0/edit?usp=sharing">Thirteen retractions this year </a>directly cite the Rogers paper.</p>



<span id="more-133168"></span>



<p>The latest retractions came October 10, when an Elsevier journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210740125001822">retracted eight studies </a>of liver transplants. The journal, <em>Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology</em>, was one of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBEVMvAo06yCwTyijJDnKAGDErGgM32W/view?usp=sharing">173 journals</a> named in the <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/2/e024473">2019 study</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction notices cite the 2019 paper and state the journal “contacted the authors to clarify concerns that pertinent details regarding the source of the organs used, consent of participating individuals, and ethical approval were lacking and/or unclear in the current article. The authors did not respond,” the notice continues.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rogers.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="422" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rogers.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-107430" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rogers.jpg 640w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/rogers-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Wendy Rogers</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/wendy-rogers/">Wendy Rogers</a>, a bioethics researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who led the 2019 study, told us the recent uptick in retractions may be the result of emails sent by a volunteer in late 2024 and 2025 to each of the named journals. The volunteer, Simone Francis, is the communications officer for the <a href="https://endtransplantabuse.org/">International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China</a>. Some journals didn’t reply at all “while others engaged to some extent,” Rogers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Elsevier confirmed the retractions in <em>CRHG</em> were the result of the organization contacting the journal in August 2023, which was when Elsevier first learned of the issue, the representative said. The “impacted journals promptly initiated an ethics investigation into the relevant publications,” the representative said, but noted “editorial decisions, including whether to retract, are made independently by each journal’s Editor-in-Chief.”</p>



<p>“The broader investigation remains ongoing,” the spokesperson wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/08/14/journals-retract-more-than-a-dozen-studies-from-china-that-may-have-used-executed-prisoners-organs/">As we reported in 2019</a>, Rogers and her colleagues did not follow up with any journals after publishing the call for retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rest of the 2025 retractions appear in four journals published by Karger, all of which note none of the authors responded to the journals’ requests for additional information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is deplorable that many journals have not retracted unethical transplant research in which the transplanted organs came from non-consenting prisoners of conscience who were killed in the process,” Rogers told us. “Journals have strict human rights and business obligations, which are breached by publishing research that raises credible concerns about human rights abuses.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogers also said journal editors are in a “strong position to raise the ethical standards of research by refusing to publish papers that raise concerns about human rights abuses, including organ trafficking and forced organ harvesting.”</p>

<p>Ariel Karlinsky was confused.<a href="https://en.economics.huji.ac.il/people/ariel-karlinsky"> A Ph.D. student</a> at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he had just received a message stating the paper he had submitted to<a href="https://www.ince.md/international-scientific-practical-conference-economic-growth-in-the-face-of-globalchallenges-strategies-for-sustainable-growth-demographic-resilience-and-socialequity-xixth-editi/"> an economics conference</a> in Moldova had been accepted.</p>



<p>But Karlinsky hadn’t submitted<a href="https://www.demographic-research.org/articles/volume/50/38"> his work</a> to the conference. In fact, he had never even heard about the event.</p>



<p>At first, Karlinsky assumed a<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02358-w"> predatory conference</a> had signed him up without his knowledge. But he recognized the name of one of the organizers, the <a href="https://www.ince.md/">National Institute for Economic Research</a>, which he knew to be legitimate.</p>



<span id="more-133159"></span>



<p>Someone, it turned out, was impersonating Karlinsky. On August 11, that someone had submitted one of the researcher’s papers to the conference under Karlinsky’s name from an email address that looked like it could be his. Only&nbsp; because the conference organizers replied to the university email address listed in his paper, instead of the one used for the submission, did the real Karlinsky learn of the scam.</p>



<p>“I have no idea what the impersonator was trying to achieve,” Karlinsky told us. “Had the organizers not emailed me, but him, with acceptance, would he have shown up pretending to be me? This is very confusing and frankly, disturbing.”</p>



<p>Identity theft is<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-016-9867-x"> a growing threat</a> to academia. Fraudsters may <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/15/more-details-on-the-bmcspringer-retraction-ring-an-impersonated-reviewer-speaks/">impersonate reviewers</a> or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">former colleagues</a> to make sure articles they or their accomplices write receive favorable reviews. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Journals may be hijacked</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/03/my-journal-was-hijacked-an-editors-experience/">swindling authors</a> into paying hundreds of dollars for useless publications. Or researchers may find their names on<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/"> papers they never wrote.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>That <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/">recently happened to </a><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Ekz7EoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Mohamed Shaaban, </a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/14/perplexed-authors-identity-forged-on-plagiarized-paper-in-probably-fake-journal/">an electrical engineer in Taiwan.</a></p>



<p>A professor at National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi, Shaaban says he was on vacation when found out about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590123025027902?via%3Dihub">the article</a>, published in <em>Results in Engineering</em> in August. The notification came from the journal to his institutional email address, despite the fact it hadn’t been used throughout the study’s submission process or during peer review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While university email addresses are the go-to means for identity verification, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/22/university-email-addresses-no-longer-effective-bulwark-against-fake-peer-review/">recent analysis</a> has revealed that fraudsters have found ways to breach this safeguard as well, identifying 94 fake profiles from a pool of thousands set up for AI conferences in 2024 and 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, the study contained factual errors and some of its figures appear to be generated using artificial intelligence, according to Shaaban, who believes the scam was meant to damage his reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shaaban immediately informed the journal and took to social media to address his concerns, leading to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.net/science/2025/8/18/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%86%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%A3%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B4">media</a> <a href="https://www.mytaiwanlife.com/news/pages/en/4pYH2i6/taiwanese-professor-039-s-research-plagiarized-and-submitted-under-his-name-suspected-retaliation/?lang=en">coverage</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A couple of days after the paper was published, the journal’s editor-in-chief received an email suggesting the fraudulent article was plagiarized from another study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261925009031?via%3Dihub">recently published</a> in <em>Applied Energy</em>. An anonymous comment <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/146ED1F3C12A8C5587A2A65530D17B">on PubPeer</a> suggested the same thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shaaban forwarded us emails from someone claiming to be Yuntian Chen, a coauthor on the<em> Applied Energy</em> study. The emails raise concerns about the now-retracted paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emails from that same address were also sent to Shaaban’s university colleagues and as well as his institution’s president, demanding administrative action against Shaaban. The sender also wrote dozens of other emails, with Shaaban copied, to other universities in Taiwan, the country’s Ministry of Higher Education, The University of Hong Kong (where Shaaban completed his doctorate), and to two universities in Malaysia where he previously worked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nOMt_KkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Chen,</a> of the Eastern Institute of Technology, in Ningbo, China, for comment but have not heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A well-tailored plot to smear my reputation as a scholar and academic,” Shaaban <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mohamed-shaaban-71119713_following-my-previous-post-and-as-anticipated-activity-7363227422932004867-sgTW/">wrote on LinkedIn</a> about the experience. “It’s unbelievable to see how evil and criminal [someone] can be.”</p>



<p>The journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590123025027902?via%3Dihub">retracted</a> the study in September. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590123025027902?via%3Dihub">notice</a> reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>After investigating the matter, the institution has confirmed that Prof. Shaaban was not involved in the submission of this article and that a suspicious email address had been used to impersonate him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But Shaaban, who often posts about research misconduct on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mohamed.shaaban.503">his Facebook page,</a> is not satisfied.&nbsp; He wants the paper to be removed entirely from the web and for the journal to conduct an in-depth investigation into who paid the article-processing charge for the manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nobody is writing a paper and submitting a paper on behalf of you for a [top-tier] journal. That doesn’t make sense,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elsevier does not “remove the name of an author from a published article, nor do we remove an article solely because an author was added without their consent,” a spokesperson for the company told us. “Removals are considered only in very limited cases, and misconduct of this nature does not typically meet the criteria for removal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reported one of those limited cases in 2023 when three publishers, including Elsevier, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/23/in-unusual-move-publishers-remove-authors-victimized-by-forger/">removed authors whose names had been forged</a> by another after the publishers received letters from an attorney hired by one of the individuals.</p>



<p>The spokesperson also said Elsevier is reviewing whether other submissions were made to its journals impersonating Shaaban.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shaaban worries that this saga will affect his career going forward. “It would always be listed in my record that I have a paper retracted,” he says, “and if people wanted to target you, they can easily say you have one retracted paper and they wouldn’t delve into the reasons.”</p>

<p>The American Heart Association is reviewing its decision to give an award to the architect of a controversial theory that is the subject of <s>eight</s> seven retracted papers, Retraction Watch has learned. In the meantime, the researcher is using the award to contest several of the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/professional-membership/awards-and-lectures/paul-dudley-white-international-scholar-award">The Paul Dudley White International Scholar Award</a> “recognizes the team of authors with the highest-ranked scientific abstract from every participating country for each AHA scientific meeting,” according to the award website.</p>



<p>At its Basic Cardiovascular Sciences 2025 conference in July, the association <a href="https://professional.heart.org/-/media/PHD-Files-2/Membership/Awards-and-Lectures/2025-Paul-Dudley-White-International-Scholars.pdf">gave the award </a>for best&nbsp; abstract from India to <a href="https://aha.abstractarchives.com/abstract/bcvs2025-4307372/microbubble-induced-shock-waves-in-blood-investigating-multiphase-sanal-flow-choking-during-decompression">work describing “Sanal flow choking” theory</a>, which is named after lead author, V. R. Sanal Kumar, a professor of aerospace engineering at Amity University in New Delhi. As we have previously reported, some scientists have denounced the concept as “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/24/controversial-rocket-scientist-in-india-threatens-legal-action-after-journals-pull-papers/">absolute nonsense</a>” and “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/04/embattled-rocket-scientist-loses-paper-following-retraction-watch-report/">inaccurate and paradoxical</a>” — and earlier this year, a journal said it “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/10/physics-of-fluids-aip-publishing-sanal-kumar-journal-retraction-thermodynamics/">fundamentally violates</a>” a law of thermodynamics.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133153"></span>



<p>Following the conference, Kumar sent emails to at least three journals — <em>Scientific Reports</em>, <em>AIP Advances</em>, and <em>Global Challenges</em> — requesting the reversal of his retractions, citing the AHA award. He copied us on those emails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of the Sanal flow choking concept has been further validated,” Kumar wrote in the email to editors at <em>Scientific Reports</em>, which retracted <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94450-8">one of his papers</a> in 2023. “The American Heart Association recognized this work by conferring the 2025 Paul Dudley International Scholar Award.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="502" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-1024x502.png" alt="" class="wp-image-133155" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-1024x502.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-300x147.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-768x377.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025-1536x753.png 1536w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sanal-flow-choking-aha-bcvs2025.png 1915w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This abstract earned its authors the Paul Dudley White International Scholar Award for India at the American Heart Association&#8217;s Basic Cardiovascular Sciences 2025 meeting. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Kumar told us the award “reinforces the scientific credibility and translational value” of the theory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suzanne Grant, vice president of media relations for the AHA, told us the award “was based on abstract scores only.” She also told us “immediately” after the meeting in July, the AHA “learned of the retraction history” of Kumar. The organization was scheduled to review the award decision this week, Grant said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grant also said the AHA has “revised the process for the review” of future award submitters “to focus more on the quality of science rather than solely on the highest score for each country.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMlFPWYIrmS/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">post on Instagram</a> on July 26, Vyadh Aerospace, for which Kumar conducts research, said the award brought the research team “A Step Closer to the Nobel Prize.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous retractions don’t always get in the way of awards. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/27/cancer-researcher-under-cloud-of-suspicion-wins-300000-science-prize/">As we wrote in 2018</a>, Carlo Croce, a cancer researcher at The Ohio State University who lost several papers for image manipulation, was awarded over $300,000 from a charitable organization after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/08/cancer-researcher-dodged-accusations-decades-new-correction/">decades of misconduct allegations</a>.</p>



<p><em>Update, Oct. 23, 2025: The headline and first paragraph previously said Kumar had eight retractions. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VRS-Kumar-Retractions-Oct-2025.pdf">He has seven</a>. </em></p>

This balancing act can be tough for any young adult, but it’s often especially challenging for students with ADHD. In high school, your teen may have benefitted from built-in structure and support systems (e.g., teachers, parents) that helped them stay on track and meet their goals. In college, those supports tend to fade, leaving students to navigate much more on their own.</p><p>As a parent, you can play an important role in helping your student adjust to these new demands. Sometimes this means offering a little extra “scaffolding”—gentle support and guidance—to help them build the skills they need to thrive on their own. That’s exactly why I wrote <em>Mastering the Transition to College: The Ultimate Guidebook for Parents of Teens with ADHD.</em> It’s packed with practical information and strategies to help you and your teen navigate these years successfully. This blog post offers a first look at some of those tips, so you’ll have tools ready if your student starts to struggle, academically or otherwise, this semester.</p><ol><li>Communication and collaboration are key. You probably know from the high school years that giving unsolicited advice to your teen can backfire. Pushing too hard often leads to resistance. Instead, try to use a calm, collaborative tone. Let your teen know you’re there to support and guide them, but that <em>they</em> are in control of their own decisions. Approaching conversations this way helps your teen feel respected and more open to brainstorming solutions with you.</li><li>Set goals. Before you can help your teen make changes, it’s important to first understand what <em>they</em> want. Ask about their goals, not just in academics, but in all areas of their life that matter to them. Once you know their priorities, you can work together to map out what steps are needed to get there. This also makes it easier to guide them without feeling like you’re imposing. Some of these steps may be addressed in the tips below.</li><li>Help your teen establish an organizational system. This may sound obvious, but it’s incredibly powerful: having a clear system to track tasks and deadlines is a game changer. Encourage your teen to choose a system that works for them. It could be a paper planner, a phone app, or a calendar on their laptop. The key is sustainability, so expect some trial and error as they experiment. Whatever they choose, the idea is that the system should be sustainable. The goal is to help them feel in control of their time, not overwhelmed by it.</li><li>Encourage your teen to develop a system for completing tasks. College life means that the to-do list is rarely empty. Your teen may feel as if their tasks are never-ending… as one is completed, another is added to the list. Therefore, developing a method for triaging what needs to get completed and by when will be crucial. An approach that balances what is important vs. what is urgent is often a good place to start.</li><li>Discuss all available campus resources with your teen. College campuses offer a lot of support to help your teen succeed. However, students (and parents) often find it difficult to know what resources are available and how to access them. Resources may be academic in nature (e.g., tutoring, office hours, advising, academic accommodations, writing center), mental health related (e.g., student health center, counseling center, skills groups), or logistical (e.g., career services, resident assistants). Knowing what resources to use, when, and how to access them will be essential for ensuring a successful college career. Further, if your teen needs more support than your conversations with them or my book can provide, finding a licensed professional may be a helpful next step. Outside help can be an important part of your teen achieving success.</li></ol><p>I hope these tips provide you with a solid starting point in supporting your teen with the transition to and through college.

<p>Academic publishing needs “renewed focus and collective action” to embrace new approaches and ensure the future of the industry, concludes <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/what-we-offer/research-publishing/publishing-futures">a report</a> from Cambridge University Press, released last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What started as an exploration of barriers to open access models turned into a call for “radical change” in academic publishing. “It has been clear for some time that the publishing ecosystem is under increasing strain,” Mandy Hill, managing director of Cambridge University Press, wrote in the introduction to the report. “This was the case before the growth of open access, but it is also clear that the shift to open has not solved the problems, as some early open access advocates may have hoped.”</p>



<p>The report, which followed workshops and interviews with stakeholders, includes results of a survey of more than 3,000 researchers, librarians, funders, publishers and societies.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133145"></span>



<p>Among its observations and recommendations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The growth in volume of research articles is overwhelming the system, as <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/low-quality-and-ai-generated-papers-could-overwhelm-publishing">other coverage</a> <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/academic-publishing-at-critical-juncture-will-break-without-change-cup-warns">has noted</a>, due to AI-generated articles and paper mill output and the increase  in scientific research more generally. </li>



<li>Economic models for publishing need reform, as “pay-to-publish and pay-to-read models continue to undermine financial sustainability” while budgets for both models remain static or shrink.</li>



<li>The academic reward system continues to incentivize quantity over quality, and “the challenges in academic publishing are inseparable from broader issues of recognition and reward.”</li>
</ul>



<p>“We fundamentally believe that publishing less – but better – is essential for the health of the entire research system worldwide,” the authors of the report state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn more about the recommendations and what comes next, Retraction Watch spoke with Hill, who stepped away from the Frankfurt Book Fair for our conversation. The text has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>We read a lot of reports on the state of publishing. This report makes some fairly provocative statements about what specific changes are needed. Why is that?</p>

<p><strong>Mandy Hill: </strong>Doing the work over the past six months, through the survey, through the workshops, really brought home that enough is enough. We&#8217;ve got to stop talking about the problem and start doing something about it. [It has been like] everyone walking past a burning building going, “Oh, that house is on fire.” And then maybe a couple of people getting buckets of water and throwing them at the fire and saying, “Yeah, [I’ve] done my bit. Tried, didn&#8217;t work.” The only thing that is going to make the difference to put this fire out is us all working together in a concerted way to really tackle it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you&#8217;re right. We have tried to make pretty provocative statements about how serious this now is. It&#8217;s not going to be sustainable if we don&#8217;t make change. I&#8217;ve chatted to a few other publishers, including some of the large commercial publishers, and they agree that the rate of submission, and then the resultant output, is unsustainable. I think everyone sees that the incentives are wrong for some people to want to change that, but I think everyone sees we&#8217;re reaching a crunch point where something has to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a publisher, what I don&#8217;t want to do is say, “The problem’s over there. Somebody else needs to sort it.” We want to say, actually, we&#8217;re all in this together. But we have to see this as a systemic challenge where no one piece can be fixed without everything else being fixed.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch:</strong> So to that end, what is Cambridge University Press willing to do? What changes will you make?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hill: </strong>We made the conscious choice to not come up with a 10-point plan of what Cambridge is going to do, because that wouldn&#8217;t have solved this. The biggest thing we can do is grab people by the hair or the hand or whichever it&#8217;s going to take to get them around the table, and make that collective action work.</p>



<p>Realistically, we publish 20,000 research articles a year. We&#8217;re a relatively small piece of the publishing puzzle. We alone can&#8217;t change things, but that cannot be our “get out of jail free” card. So there are some things we want to do through demonstration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re looking at ourselves in the mirror. Are all of our journals adding value in their communities? What can we do to ensure they are? We&#8217;ve been very clear in our strategy that we will never be driven by quantity, that there will be times when journals will grow, but that&#8217;s always got to be quality driven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Probably the biggest way we hope we can make wider action is as a department of the University of Cambridge. We actually think the convening power of the University of Cambridge with us as a part of it — we&#8217;re both a leading university and a leading publisher — and with those two sides of our identity, we think we can really pull people together. We&#8217;ve already tried to have conversations with funders, but we hope to expand that.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>Do you think the administration at the university is up for these conversations? Do they acknowledge the problem and acknowledge that they can play a role in making changes that influence the wider circle?</p>



<p><strong>Hill: </strong>My hesitation is not wanting to put words into the mouth of the university. What I can say, though, is that we have had conversations, not only with the vice chancellor, but also with the pro vice chancellor of research and the university librarian, and they are very supportive of what we&#8217;re doing and want to work with us on that idea of convening. I think the University of Cambridge is a micro-example of the complexities of solving a problem like this. They would acknowledge themselves that this is going to be a really tricky one to solve, and there aren&#8217;t going to be easy answers. They&#8217;ve certainly said they are very keen to work with the idea of convening conversations to drive collective action.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>In terms of a business model for the university press, what would publishing less look like? Is that sustainable for an academic publisher?</p>



<p><strong>Hill: </strong>There are a number of journals, particularly that have been created over the past few years, that aren&#8217;t adding value and are just churning out quantity. One of the questions I&#8217;m asking my team is, how do we know if journals are valued by the community? What is a good rating of value? Is it something that people think, “I want to publish in that journal because I agree with the editorial policies?” Or, “They really support the development of my articles.” There&#8217;s something about the journal that is genuinely valued, and that&#8217;s something hard to quantify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other piece in the report is really talking about alternative publishing platforms. If we say there&#8217;s a whole chunk of content that does get benefit from being published in journals, fantastic. But there&#8217;s other content that&#8217;s not benefiting from being published in journals. It doesn&#8217;t warrant the cost that it&#8217;s adding into the system. It could be either of those things. There needs to be credible, scalable alternatives. So another part of the conversation we want to be part of is, what do those look like? At the moment there are loads of little things going on. Very few of them have got genuine scale, and so the reinvention of the wheel going on and the hidden costs in the system are not useful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So in answer to your question, if we were to publish fewer journal articles, can we use our publishing services to support other publishing outlets? What exactly does that look like? Ask me in five years.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>You write in the report, “The dominance of the impact factor must be replaced with more balanced metrics that acknowledge the real value of research outputs.” What do you mean by that?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hill:</strong> How long has this been talked about? <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a> has been around for how many years [saying] that the impact factor should not be used as a proxy for the quality of the individual articles that are published in that journal? And they shouldn&#8217;t, and the impact factor of where a researcher has had their research published should not be used in promotion decisions. It feels like forever, but it hasn&#8217;t changed behaviors. So there&#8217;s a cultural change that&#8217;s required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got to think together. I think it’s going to be quite a complex one, and may well vary by subject. Maybe it&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to value different outputs.The dependence on the journal article at the moment is really not reflecting the variety of research outputs that there are now. And we&#8217;re kind of shoving all research into a journal-shaped output, and it doesn&#8217;t really do a lot of things any favors. We should have more versatility.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: </strong>In the survey portion of the report, you found 86% of respondents agreed that a future where the majority of research articles are made freely available is desirable, and 69% agreed that the move to more open access journal publishing so far has made high quality research outputs easier to discover. Is a majority open access world a sustainable business model for both the publishers and for the researchers?</p>



<p><strong>Hill:</strong> I strongly believe we would think about open access as the default model, because we can see there&#8217;s so much evidence now in terms of citations and usage, and the way researchers around the world can access, the geographic distribution of usage that open access is better for research. It&#8217;s more equitable. We&#8217;ve got to have a system designed like that. So I think the question is not if it&#8217;s sustainable, it&#8217;s how we make it sustainable.&nbsp;</p>
