              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/12/10/updated-endorsement-policy-for-arxiv-mathematics/">Attention Authors: updated endorsement policy for arXiv Mathematics</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arXiv Mathematics section</span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement-math.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has updated its endorsement policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of December 10th, 2025, the arXiv Mathematics section will no longer accept institutional email addresses (i.e., an email address associated with an academic or research institution) as the sole qualifier for an automatic endorsement for new authors. This policy update is being made to support the arXiv community (authors, readers, volunteer moderators, and staff) by stemming the flood of low-quality, non-scientific submissions to the arXiv Math section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv was built for scientists, by scientists. Our mission has always been to advance science by providing a place for the scientific community to freely and quickly share and discover valuable and relevant scientific research. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv authors are expected to be scientists with expertise in their field and endorsement has been required from the early days of arXiv. The arXiv endorsement process ensures a sustainable and fair way for scientists to help arXiv determine who is a member of good standing in the scientific community by vouching for the scientific work of first-time submitters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past most arXiv sections, including Math, auto-endorsed first-time submitters with affiliation to an academic or research institute. arXiv felt this was a fair way to allow new researchers to submit to arXiv while still preserving the corpus and maintaining a standard of scientific integrity. However, over the past years, arXiv has received an unsustainable increase in the number of non-scientific submissions from automatically endorsed users, increasing the rejection rate and requiring excessive moderation and staff effort. Because of this, we have determined that email addresses associated with academic or research institutions are no longer a sufficient credential for determining minimum research competence. As a result, automatic endorsements will no longer be based solely on an author’s institutional email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic endorsement for new submitters in all Math categories will now require both 1) an email address from an academic/research institution, and 2) previous authorship on an existing paper which has been accepted to the arXiv Mathematics section (see </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper ownership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). New submitters who cannot meet these requirements will no longer be automatically endorsed, but can still </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html#who-can-endorse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtain a personal endorsement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly from an established arXiv author in the same research area.</span></p>
<p><b>What does this update mean for authors in the arXiv Mathematics section?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Auto-endorsement” is practically invisible to most arXiv authors, so this policy update may seem confusing. In the past, when an arXiv author with an institutional affiliation submitted a manuscript for the first time to the Mathematics section on arXiv, the system would allow them to pass through the submission process automatically, with no mention of endorsement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most arXiv authors submitting to arXiv Math categories will not notice a change at all. All authors who are already endorsed to submit to a Math category will continue to be endorsed as long as they remain in good standing and do not violate the arXiv code of conduct. This policy update will mostly affect new submitters— arXiv authors who are submitting for the first time to a category in arXiv’s Mathematics section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters to a Math category will need to pursue one of the following paths for endorsement before they can submit:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters who have an institutional email and are a co-author of a paper in an arXiv Math category and have already claimed ownership of that paper may be auto-endorsed and able to submit papers without further action.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters who have an institutional email and no claimed papers but are co-authors of other papers accepted to an arXiv Math category must </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim ownership of their papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After successfully claiming ownership on their previous papers, they may be auto-endorsed and able to submit papers without further action.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters who </span><b>do not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have an institutional email and no claimed papers, but are co-authors of other papers accepted to an arXiv Math category should </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim ownership of all their papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If still unable to submit, these users must pursue personal endorsement (see next bullet).
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New submitters who are not co-authors on any previous papers on arXiv Mathematics must be personally endorsed to submit to any arXiv Math category, </span><b>whether they have an institutional email affiliation or not.</b> <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our help pages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go into detail on how to get personally endorsed by an advisor, colleague, or arXiv author with endorsement privileges. arXiv staff are not able to personally endorse arXiv authors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This policy update only applies to arXiv Mathematics, and</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the Math categories contained in the section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please note, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/list/math-ph/recent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mathematical Physics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (math-ph) is a sub-section of Physics and will follow endorsement rules for Physics. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each category of arXiv has different moderators, who are subject matter experts with a terminal degree in their particular subject, to best serve the scholarly pursuits, goals, and standards of their category. While this policy update is currently only being implemented for the arXiv Mathematics section, other arXiv sections may wish to update their endorsement policies in the future. We will make these updates public if and when they do occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to our scientific community for supporting us in this policy update. We rely on you to help us keep arXiv open and free, and to help us make sure submissions to arXiv are scientifically rigorous and of interest to the community.</span></p>

<p>The head of a nuclear physics institute in Kazakhstan now has 21 retractions to his name — most of them logged in the past year — following dozens of his papers being flagged on PubPeer for data reuse and images showing suspiciously similar patterns of background noise, suggesting manipulation.</p>



<p>Maxim Zdorovets, director of the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Astana, has written or coauthored <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36055537300">480 papers indexed on Scopus</a>, and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/13/4/55">one analysis</a> puts him as the third most cited researcher in Kazakhstan. His prolific publication record <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2025/01/03/schneider-shorts-3-01-2025-a-flagship-of-science-on-the-entire-continent-and-in-the-whole-world/#zdorovets">has been linked</a> to Russian paper mills, though those claims are unverified. Zdorovets has defended his work in a series of online posts, arguing the imaging similarities come from technical issues and that his own analyses prove image manipulation did not occur. He did not respond to Retraction Watch’s request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest retraction for Zdorovets <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063774525050013">came last month</a> when <em>Crystallography Reports </em>retracted a study containing electron microscope images “highly similar” to those published a year earlier in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1023193525060011">now-retracted paper</a> in the <em>Russian Journal of Electrochemistry</em> by a similar group of authors. Both papers also included images that closely resemble ones Zdorovets and his colleagues presented <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/NAP.2017.8190333">at a nanomaterials conference</a> in Ukraine in 2017. In each instance, the images were meant to be showing different materials.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133566"></span>



<p>According to many of the retraction notices, Zdorovets&#8217; papers have noise in the data that appears unusually similar across several figures. In 2023, a PubPeer commenter who <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/95FE7942B21B21CE136F4C845ED8BB">pointed out suspicious patterns</a> in a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/aa92f2">2017<em> Materials Research Express </em>paper</a> triggered a lengthy exchange with IOP Publishing, the journal’s publisher, which conducted three separate investigations into the paper. Initially, IOP said their subject-matter expert consultant found no sign of “intentional alteration,” and the company decided to take no action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenters pushed back, and in June 2024, the publisher sought opinions from three more experts, one whom they described as an “absolute expert in this area.” The experts concluded the raw data submitted by the authors showed “distinct backgrounds.” The publisher again decided not to act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2024, Maarten Van Kampen, a data sleuth in the Netherlands, weighed in on the PubPeer thread, agreeing that the background noise looked identical and also pointing out similarities between data in the 2017 paper and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0020168524010011">another since-retracted paper</a> by a similar group of authors, including Zdorovets, in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, this June, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/95FE7942B21B21CE136F4C845ED8BB#11">IOP Publishing acknowledged</a> that their experts had “failed to compare the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Raw_data_for_the_article_Radiation_modification_of_Ni_nanotubes_by_electrons_/28720913/1">raw data provided by the authors</a> with the published data,” despite earlier claims to the contrary. The journal <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/addf2c">retracted the article</a> for containing identical background noise in the X-ray diffractions, which they said “can be indicative of image manipulation.” They also noted the raw data the authors provided didn’t match the paper’s data, meaning they could find “no evidence of the experiments being undertaken.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked about the investigations, Kim Eggleton, IOP Publishing’s head of peer review and research integrity, said the first set of experts had been given raw data in a different file format than the later group of experts. The newer group also included a specialist in X-ray diffraction and two of the PubPeer commenters who first raised concerns. They had requested the specific format “so they could assess the concerns in greater depth,” she said.</p>



<p>In August this year, the paper’s second author, Marat Kaikanov, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/95FE7942B21B21CE136F4C845ED8BB#13">posted</a> in the PubPeer thread that he hoped his colleagues responsible for the X-ray measurements would “be able to confirm the accuracy” of the results. Kaikanov told us he couldn’t evaluate the flagged data firsthand because those experiments were outside his area of responsibility, but said his own contribution “was completed diligently and in full.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While he didn’t weigh in on that PubPeer exchange, Zdorovets has engaged with some other criticisms on the platform, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A%28%28Maxim+OR+M+OR+MM+OR+MV%29+Zdorovets%29">where 85 papers he coauthored are flagged</a>. In one detailed response, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/53E85E814103A3C40F59D68C8CBD2A#5">he dismissed an allegation</a> the background noise in X-ray diffraction images were duplicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were puzzled by such an unexpected question,” he wrote, “since there is no and cannot be any reasonable sense to somehow artificially change the background on the spectra mentioned in the question.” In his comments on PubPeer, he says he analyzed both spectra and “can firmly say that they are not duplicated in any part,” though he acknowledged a “high degree of similarity” in the backgrounds. His explanation is that the samples were so thin that the instrument recorded signals from the table beneath them, resulting in the resemblances — a claim which Van Kampen, the Dutch data sleuth, calls “unhinged.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As sleuths we get gray hair from these arguments,” Van Kampen told Retraction Watch, adding that persistent denial helps delay or even prevent retractions. He referred to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/04/cosig-sleuths-publish-toolkit-post-publication-review/">a COSIG guide</a> <a href="https://osf.io/2kdez/files/685xa">that states</a>, “No matter what, no two XRD patterns will feature the same noise pattern, even if they are collected from the same sample on the same instrument with the same settings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2018 paper, published in <em>Journal of Nanoparticle Research, </em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11051-018-4346-8">was retracted</a> in December 2024 because of seemingly identical background noise in two figures. When the journal asked the authors for the original data, they found what was provided “differs substantially” from what had been published, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/53E85E814103A3C40F59D68C8CBD2A#10">comments made</a> after the retraction, Zdorovets expressed frustration over a lack of “scientifically-grounded counter arguments” and called the accusations “unfounded.” He said he had provided the original data to the journal and said there was “no conflict” between the submitted files and the figures in the article. “We strongly disagree with the decision to retract,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zdorovets has defended his work in reports he posted on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maxim-Zdorovets">his personal ResearchGate, including </a>what he says is a mathematical analysis of the data in three retracted papers showing no duplications. His coauthors have argued that <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1BBF0500CEE747B1738C9838F2B944">similarities come from</a> reduced image quality and say critics misunderstood <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/81B9BA737237E0C6AD77E20B83E3D3">how X-ray diffraction data</a> were processed, claiming similarities arose from how the figures were viewed or plotted. </p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WsPCVtq9U67chAnzYI3qOHJvaaksXy1WvEkThpfSA8w/edit?usp=sharing">In a statement to Retraction Watch</a>, a researcher who has collaborated with Zdorovets and wished to remain anonymous said ”neither I nor the authors of these papers, including Prof. Zdorovets, performed XRD measurements personally,” and that the measurements came from a specialist at the institute whose data they had no reason to doubt. They suggested post-processing procedures such as smoothing, background correction and normalization might explain the observations. They said all the X-ray diffraction data now undergo internal verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The collaborator said the group felt “deliberately targeted” on PubPeer since “so-called ‘reviewers’ on PubPeer presuppose our guilt in advance.”</p>



<p>The research group remains open to constructive dialogue, the collaborator wrote, and maintains the observed problems are ones of method, not falsification, problems which “could and should have been resolved through correction rather than full retraction.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While background noise duplication is the most frequent issue raised around Zdorovets’ work, seven of the retraction notices also refer to data being reused across several papers that allegedly report on different materials and experiments. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272884218319783">One 2018 paper</a>, published in <em>Ceramics International,</em> is a complete duplication of another paper <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/aac7ba">published</a> in <em>Materials Research Express</em> a few months earlier by a similar group of authors. The editor called the duplication a “misuse of the scientific publishing system.” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838825021930">A 2019 paper</a> in <em>Journal of Alloys and Compounds,</em> duplicates data and tables published <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/15/20/1590">two months earlier</a> in <em>Nanomaterials</em>. That earlier paper, now also retracted, used images published another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0042207X19302830">month earlier</a> in <em>Vacuum.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In 2023, Zdorovets <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/en-gb/promotions/scopus-awards-kazakhstan-2023">won a Scopus prize</a> supported by Elsevier and the government of Kazakhstan to recognize leading Kazakh researchers. He was also <a href="https://enu.kz/en/news/2561">recently elected</a> to the National Academy of Sciences of Kazakhstan.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/the-philosophical-misconception-behind-the-llm-cult-or-why-llms-will-always-bullshit/">The philosophical misconception behind the LLM cult (or why LLMs will always bullshit)</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is this idea that if a large language model (LLM) is trained on a large corpus of text, then it knows whatever knowledge is in that corpus. Improving the performance is then essentially a matter of scaling: as you expand the database, you expand knowledge, assuming the statistical model is fine enough (aka many parameters). You can then ask questions and the LLM will answer according to the knowledge in the corpus.</p>



<p>This might sound like a reasonable view, but it is based on a misconception about the nature of knowledge. Indeed, an implicit assumption is that the corpus is logically consistent. But what if it contains a proposition as well as its contradiction, for example the Earth is round and the Earth is flat? In that case, the trained LLM cannot produce consistent answers; it will answer differently, depending on how it is cued – an annoying experience that many users are familiar with.</p>



<p>The natural answer would be to build a high-quality corpus, e.g. by selecting academic textbooks, rather than conspiracy theories. Unfortunately, this is a naïve view of scientific knowledge, one that has been thoroughly debunked by over a century of philosophy of science. It is the view that science is a linear accumulative process: you add observations, and you add deductions, and if you check those assertions, then you get a consistent, certified, corpus of knowledge. Knowledge, then, is constituted of propositions that derive directly from observations, plus what you can logically deduce from those (this is essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>). It follows that, if you add a book to a corpus of books, you necessarily increase knowledge, by exactly one book (assuming there is no redundancy).</p>



<p>As intuitive as it might sound, this view is utterly false. It has been shattered on historical grounds by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">Thomas Kuhn</a> (see also <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3175205-inventing-temperature">Hasok Chang</a> for more recent work), and on philosophical grounds by various philosophers, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Lakatos">Lakatos</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis">Quine</a> and others. In science, theories get superseded by other theories that contradict them. At any given time, there are always different theories that coexist, and diverging interpretations of facts. Science is a debate. Human knowledge is contradictory, and science is about trying to resolve those contradictions, not accumulating true propositions. Any working scientist knows that any field is full of paradoxes, internal contradictions and diverging views. It follows that no scientific corpus is internally consistent.</p>



<p>If you build a statistical model of an inconsistent corpus, you do not resolve those contradictions. Instead, what happens is that, depending on context (the prompt), the model will predict one thing or its contrary, possibly within the same session, with apparent confidence – indeed, if you merge two confident propositions, you get a confident contradiction, not doubt. An LLM will always bullshit. Scaling alone (whether of the corpus or of the model) cannot solve this problem.</p>

<p>Muhammad Zain Yousaf, a postdoc at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, became a scholar of note overnight. Or so it would seem, based on his now-defunct Google Scholar profile: From a modest 47 in 2022 and around 100 in 2023, Yousaf’s citations jumped to 629 in 2024. His <a href="https://scientific-publishing.webshop.elsevier.com/publication-recognition/what-good-h-index/">h-index</a>, a measure combining publication and citation numbers, took off accordingly, reaching levels typical of a senior academic.</p>



<p>But another researcher smelled a rat and took a closer look at Yousaf’s publications. In just two days, Yousaf had <a href="https://www.techrxiv.org/users/859741-muhammad-zain-yousaf">uploaded 10 short documents</a> to TechRxiv, a preprint server hosted by the U.S.-based Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, or IEEE. Each of the documents was chock-full of self-citations. In five cases, Yousaf was an author on all 37 papers in the reference list; the rest of the time, his publications made up nearly two-thirds of the reference list.</p>



<p>“Many of these documents appear to be low quality, as evidenced by their lack of coherence and technical quality,” the concerned researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, said of the preprints in an email to TechRxiv last December.</p>



<span id="more-133557"></span>



<p>The researcher added that Yousaf’s actions were “a clear attempt to manipulate citation metrics on external platforms such as Google Scholar” and “undermine the credibility of TechRxiv as a platform for genuine academic contributions.” </p>



<p>One year later all of the documents remain on IEEE’s server. “IEEE is aware of the concerns regarding these papers and is investigating,” Francine Tardo, corporate spokesperson for the organization, told us.</p>

(Click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Yousaf, an electrical engineer, did not acknowledge our emails laying out the allegations against him and asking for an interview. But on the day we first contacted him, the researcher’s <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&amp;hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;user=ERQykZAAAAAJ">Google Scholar page</a>, which listed his h-index as 21, was taken down; his name on TechRxiv was shortened to “Yousaf” and delinked from <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6664-8235">his ORCID profile</a>; and the ORCID entry describing his current position at Zhejiang University – “Posdoctrate (Space)” (sic) – disappeared. Several more entries were removed later. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1452398125002949">recent paper</a> lists Yousaf’s affiliations as the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Zhejiang University and the Center for Research on Microgrids (CROM) at Huanjiang Laboratory in Zhuji.</p>



<p>Google Scholar has become the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7">go-to source</a> of publication metrics for academics evaluating new job applicants, even at renowned universities in the United States&nbsp; and England. But the tool is exceedingly easy to game for those looking for a shortcut to impressive numbers – the service will index even non-existent papers cited in preprints – as researchers have shown <a href="https://hal.science/hal-00713564">again</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0638">again</a> (and <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/2024/07/18/engineering-the-worlds-highest-cited-cat-larry/">again</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7">again</a> and <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/2025/05/06/google-scholar-is-still-doing-nothing-about-citation-manipulation/">again</a>). We wrote about a high-profile computer scientist in Spain, Juan Manuel Corchado, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/25/how-critics-say-a-computer-scientist-in-spain-artificially-boosted-his-google-scholar-metrics/">who had done just that</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get a better sense of how this tactic inflated the researcher’s h-index, David Robert Grimes, one of Retraction Watch’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/27/meet-the-first-two-retraction-watch-sleuths-in-residence/">Sleuths in Residence</a>, scraped data from Google Scholar on September 10, when Yousaf’s h-index was 19. Excluding self-citations slashed the index to 13, and removing sources with no or minimal peer review, such as preprints and conference proceedings, brought it down to 12. When Grimes excluded both self-citation and sources without peer review, Yousaf’s h-index dropped to 9, a reduction of more than 50 percent. (Yousaf’s h-index according to Scopus, the Elsevier citation database, is <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57204241229">14</a>, up from 13 in November.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="476" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1-1024x476.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-133562" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1-1024x476.jpeg 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1-300x139.jpeg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1-768x357.jpeg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpeg 1380w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The position at Zhejiang University shown in this screenshot of Yousaf&#8217;s ORCID profile has since been deleted.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is far from the first time somebody has used non-peer-reviewed archives to manipulate Google Scholar,” said <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/">Reese Richardson</a> of Northwestern University, who studies scientific fraud. “Google Scholar has made it very clear they don&#8217;t intend to fix this. They have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2014.16269">known about this for 10 years</a>.”</p>



<p>Google did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p><a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/yasir-zaki.html">Yasir Zaki</a>, a computer scientist at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, recently published a study describing different ways <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7">Google Scholar metrics can be manipulated</a>. Yousaf’s case, Zaki said, is “in line with what we have seen in the past.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Many of our suspicious authors were uploading documents to either ResearchGate or Authorea,” Zaki told us. “On a related note, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03664-7">arXiv has banned</a> computer-science review papers that have not been published for the exact same reason, because some authors are using this as a way to inflate their citations.”</p>



<p>Zaki said he and his colleagues built a tool using data from OpenAlex to visualize collaboration patterns for specific researchers. The tool shows Yousaf had nearly 130 unique coauthors with whom he collaborated only once, and that in 2025, Yousaf had as many as 120 new unique coauthors – both abnormally high numbers, according to Zaki.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.graham-kendall.com/">Graham Kendall</a>, a computer scientist and deputy vice chancellor at Mila University in Malaysia who writes frequently about publications ethics, also noted a steep rise in citations in 2025 on Yousaf’s <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57204241229">Scopus profile</a>. Such an increase raises “a red flag,” Kendall told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Richardson’s view, metrics gaming “is going to happen so long as there&#8217;s a pressure for citations. The question is, who is going to willingly participate in it? So TechRxiv has decided that they&#8217;re going to, Google Scholar has decided that they&#8217;re going to.”</p>
