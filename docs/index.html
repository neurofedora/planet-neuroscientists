                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="653" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction-1024x653.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131864" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction-1024x653.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction-300x191.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction-768x489.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-reports-sunlife-retraction.png 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">One of several retraction notices noting &#8220;the existence and nature&#8221; of a company couldn&#8217;t be confirmed.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since March of last year, Elsevier has pulled around 60 papers connected to companies in the Caucasus region that don’t seem to exist. The retraction notices attribute the decision to suspicious changes in authorship and the authors being unable to verify the existence of their employers. Online sleuths have also flagged potentially manipulated citations among the articles. </p>



<p>Each of the retracted papers appears to follow an identical pattern, based on the details given in the retraction notices. First, a solo author submits a paper and claims to be affiliated with a company that doesn’t appear in any business registries. During the revision process, the author adds several other authors to the paper — including new first and corresponding authors, despite no clear contribution to the original work. This behavior <a href="https://www.escienceediting.org/journal/view.php?number=314">is typical of</a> paper mills and authorship-for-sale schemes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked by the editors, the original authors are unable to explain why they added the additional authors, nor validate the “nature” or “existence” of the companies they were claiming an affiliation with, according to the retraction notices.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131863"></span>



<p> The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OZ3Bw927zex1a8W6GvxX3KANp3azPhArZwl1fWHi7Bw/edit?gid=0#gid=0">papers linked to these companies</a> seem to be largely published in Elsevier journals, with a few exceptions. A spokesperson for the publisher said they discovered “unauthorized authorship changes” during the review process, and began an investigation into the articles. The press office has not responded to follow-up questions about why the papers were published if they were being investigated in the review stage. </p>



<p>Elsevier does allow authors to be added during the revision process, under certain conditions. <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/behind-the-byline-identifying-and-addressing-authorship-changes">According to a December 2024 guide</a>, any changes to authorship before a paper is accepted should be approved by the editor and accompanied by a written explanation. The guide states authors are “now required” to submit a form for editorial consideration to change authorship, but when that form became a requirement is unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Dozens of papers are linked to ‘Sun-life’ or ‘Sunlife’ company, and in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670725001374">one instance</a> “Sun-light.” The company is purportedly headquartered in Baku, Azerbaijan, although <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018584">one article</a> bases it in Bangkok, Thailand. Several authors claim to be affiliated with the departments of electrical engineering, solar energy, or stomatology – a field related to dentistry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither business name appears to be on any Azerbaijani corporate listings, but a website for the company briefly appeared online. A domain was registered in March 2024, around the time that <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/03/01/schneider-shorts-1-03-2024-remember-why-we-work-on-cancer/">‘For Better Science’ began raising questions</a> about the papers, and of the first retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The website’s meta description says the company is a “leading force” in the renewable energy sector, and that it was founded in 2015. But the domain status is pending delete, meaning whoever owns the domain has not renewed the purchase, and the link no longer seems to connect to any content. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240902061822/http://sunlife-pv.com/">archived snapshot</a> of the website shows a paragraph referring to an American non-profit organization that’s unrelated to Sunlife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A similar pattern appears with “Arian company,” claiming to be based in Yerevan, Armenia. That name can be found among legitimate Armenian businesses, but they are hospitality or jewelry businesses, not ones involved in scientific research. In one case, a submitting author named Ashk Fars claimed an affiliation with Sunlife in Azerbaijan <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484721011422">in 2021</a>, and then to Arian company in Armenia <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319925009292">in 2023</a> as well as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544223030748?via%3Dihub">“Yerevn Company”</a> the same year. No contact information or online presence could be found for Fars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexander Magazinov, a Kazakhstan-based software engineer known for uncovering suspicious papers, has looked into these companies, commenting on dozens of the articles on PubPeer highlighting the fake affiliations. While Magazinov said the first retraction was independent of his findings, he later contacted Elsevier about the papers linked to Arian Company, prompting the publisher to ask him for evidence the company was fake. </p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19sC1DbvVQoy1aJJlQSb6DsbJgOjjtOHlG8xgF8QgDn4/edit?gid=0#gid=0">In his research</a>, he has spotted another affiliation he presumes to be fake: &#8220;Solar Energy and Power Electronic Co.,&#8221; which claims to be based in Japan but is also listed in cities across Turkey and in Germany. None of these papers have been retracted. </p>



<p>Nasrin Eghbalian appears at least five times as the submitting author and was the only person affiliated with the ghost companies who had a listed email address. In February 2024, Eghbalian <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A53816914619B7BE862A766738E64B#0">responded to a PubPeer inquiry</a> about the nature of Sunlife. He claimed the company is active in research projects and renewable energy projects, but that it had stopped operating, even though the company’s website was registered a month after his comment:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The research activity of this company is closed and we are not be able to contact with the related manager. We used the valid affiliation due to the collaboration with this company. Now, if there is serious concern about this affiliation, please remove it. Regards, Authors</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked for proof of the company’s existence, Eghbalian declined to provide proof publicly:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As you know the employees in a private company doesn&#8217;t have accessibility for the company details. To solve the mentioned problem, I have contacted with all managers in the company who I was familiar with them. Fortunately, I get some information from this company. But, to have more details, I can not send them in public pages. Please send me your email for further communications and clarifications.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eghbalian did not respond to a request for comment to the listed email address, and doesn’t appear to have a verifiable online presence. Nor do any of the other authors who had initially submitted the papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors added to the papers during the revision stage are affiliated with institutions in China. Nearly all of these authors’ names appear just once among all the retracted papers, whereas the authors who initially submitted the work published several papers each. None of the new corresponding authors have responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Retraction Watch has written about some of the journals that published papers from with the sham company affiliations. At least eight papers appear in the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=%22journal+of+cleaner+production%22"><em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em></a>, which has previously been flagged for large numbers of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">self-citations</a>. At least nine of the papers appear in the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/21/elsevier-retracting-26-papers-accepted-fake-reviews/#more-53130"><em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em></a>, which has come under scrutiny for publishing papers with fake peer reviews.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from authorship concerns, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/7E40F1302E65AB7667D0B6A2B57DBF#0">one PubPeer commenter mentioned</a> possibly manufactured citations. Many of the retracted papers cite Oveis Abedinia from the Zenith Sustainable Energy Institute in Iran. In an email to Retraction Watch, Abedinia asked us not to name him in this story and wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I have no connection to the authors or the journals involved, and I was not aware of these papers citing my work. I have never used or supported any citation-increasing services, and I strongly oppose any unethical citation practices.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2025/05/updated-version-of-the-how-equitable-is-it-tool-for-assessing-equity-in-scholarly-communication-models/">Updated version of the “How Equitable Is It?” tool for assessing equity in scholarly communication models</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS, cOAlition S and Jisc issued the following press release on Wednesday, May 14, 2025</p>



<p>[Strasbourg, 14 May 2025] The &ldquo;<a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/Equity-Tool">How Equitable Is It?</a>&rdquo; tool, designed to assess the equity of scholarly communication models, has been officially launched today in its updated version following a comprehensive review of community feedback. Originally introduced as a beta version in September 2024 at the OASPA conference, this refined version of the tool incorporates significant improvements based on input from across the scholarly publishing ecosystem.</p>



<p>Developed by a <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/moving-away-from-apcs/">multi-stakeholder Working Group</a>, comprising <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/beyond-article-based-charges-working-group-established/">librarians, library consortia representatives, funders and publishers</a>, and convened by <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">cOAlition S</a>, <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/">PLOS</a>, the tool aims to provide a framework for evaluating scholarly communication models and arrangements on the axis of equity<strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Key enhancements</strong></p>



<p>The revised tool offers enhanced guidance for users and clearer definitions of equity indicators, across the seven core assessment criteria:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Access to Read&nbsp;</li>



<li>Publishing immediate Open Access&nbsp;</li>



<li>Maximizing participation&nbsp;</li>



<li>Re-use rights&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pricing and fee transparency&nbsp;</li>



<li>Promoting and encouraging open research practices: data and code&nbsp;</li>



<li>Promoting and encouraging open research practices: preprints and open peer review</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Community-driven improvements</strong></p>



<p>From September 2024 through January 2025, the Working Group collected extensive feedback from stakeholders who tested the beta version. This collaborative approach ensured that the tool&rsquo;s updated version addresses practical challenges faced by institutions, library consortia, funders, and publishers in evaluating equity within scholarly communication models and arrangements.</p>



<p>The tool, which was inspired by the &ldquo;<a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/howopenisit/">How Open Is It?</a>&rdquo; framework, is targeted at institutions, library consortia, funders and publishers, i.e. the stakeholders either investing or receiving funds for publishing services. It offers users the opportunity to rate scholarly communication models and arrangements across seven criteria:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert Kiley, Head of Strategy at cOAlition S and co-Chair of the Working Group, stated: <em>&ldquo;We are grateful to everyone who provided feedback during the testing period. Their insights have been instrumental in refining this tool to better serve stakeholders in making informed decisions when investing or receiving funds for publishing services while seeking equity&rdquo;.</em></p>



<p>Roheena Anand, Executive Director of Global Publishing Development &amp; Sales at PLOS, added: <em>&ldquo;With this updated release, we&rsquo;re delivering on our promise to create a practical tool that reflects diverse stakeholder perspectives. The refinements made based on community feedback have strengthened the tool&rsquo;s ability to assess equity across different publishing models and arrangements.&rdquo;</em></p>



<p>Anna Vernon, Head of Research Licensing at Jisc, commented: <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been using the &ldquo;How Equitable Is It?&rdquo; tool to understand how agreements can broaden participation in scholarly publishing. The clearer framework of the updated version will further allow institutions to make more nuanced assessments of how their resources can best support equitable knowledge dissemination.&rdquo;</em></p>



<p><strong>How the tool works</strong></p>



<p>Based on the above-mentioned criteria, the &ldquo;<a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/Equity-Tool">How Equitable Is It?</a>&rdquo; tool prompts users to consider to what extent the model (and associated funding flow) they are assessing facilitates (or restricts) equitable participation in knowledge sharing. Users score each criterion on a scale from &ldquo;least equitable&rdquo; to &ldquo;most equitable,&rdquo; receiving an overall equity score upon completion, along with a summary of their responses.</p>



<p>Rather than prescribing outcomes, the tool empowers users to exercise their judgment in rating models against equitable criteria, with no pre-populated data shaping evaluations.</p>



<p>The &ldquo;How Equitable Is It?&rdquo; tool is available at <a href="https://coalitions.typeform.com/Equity-Tool">https://coalitions.typeform.com/Equity-Tool</a>. A detailed description of the revised criteria and their definitions can be accessed at: <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HowEquitableIsIt_Framework_criteria_definitions.pdf">Framework_criteria_definitions.pdf</a></p>



<p><strong>Future development</strong></p>



<p>The Working Group remains committed to the ongoing development of the tool, with plans to gather implementation case studies and establish a community of practice around equity assessment in scholarly communication. Users of the tool are encouraged to share their experiences at info@coalition-s.org.&nbsp; The Group will review this feedback and publish annual updates as appropriate.</p>

<p>Several studies have tackled the issue of what effect a retracted paper has on a scientist’s reputation and publication record. The <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/11/07/doing-the-right-thing-scientists-reward-authors-who-report-their-own-errors-says-study/">answer is</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/27/authors-retract-honest-error-say-arent-penalized-result/">by and large</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/16/life-after-retraction-in-many-cases-its-forgive-and-forget/">it depends</a>: The contribution the researcher made on the paper, their career stage, the field of study and the reason for the retraction all play a role.</p>



<p>Three researchers from New York University’s campus in Abu Dhabi wanted to&nbsp; better understand how a retraction affects a scientist’s career trajectory and future collaborations. Using the Retraction Watch Database, they looked at papers retracted between 1990 and 2015, and merged that data with Microsoft Academic Graph to generate information on researchers’ pre- and post-retraction publication patterns, as well as their collaboration networks. They also looked at Altmetric scores of retractions to factor in the attention a retraction got.</p>



<p>From that data, they extrapolated if and when researchers with retracted papers left scientific publishing, and looked for trends in researchers’ collaboration networks before and after the retraction.</p>



<span id="more-131856"></span>



<p>Shahan Ali Memon, Kinga Makovi and Bedoor AlShebli wrote the article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02154-0">Characterizing the effect of retractions on publishing careers</a>,” published in April in <em>Nature Human Behavior. </em>We asked them about their research, their findings and the inspiration for the study.</p>



<p>Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Your study looks across all disciplines. What trends did you find? And what differences did you find among the fields of science?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Memon: </strong>Our analysis centered on STEM, particularly the natural sciences, and revealed a consistent pattern across fields: Retracted authors who remained in publishing careers retained and gained more collaborators than their matched counterparts who did not have retractions, with the largest gaps appearing in biology and medicine.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Of the researchers with retractions in your dataset, how many left science? What trends did you find in that data?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Memon:</strong> We found that about 46% of the retracted authors leave their academic publishing around the time of the retraction, and that the early-career authors, those whose papers are retracted due to misconduct and plagiarism, and those with higher online attention were more likely to leave when experiencing a retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found that the retracted authors who remained in publishing careers did not suffer a reduction in the size of their collaboration networks post-retraction; instead, they built larger collaborations than their counterparts. However, this increase in size – both retaining more old and creating more new collaborations – was accompanied by qualitative differences, with retaining less senior, less productive and less impactful collaborators, which was balanced by gaining more impactful ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that these are the broad contours of the results and rely on averages using all fields and academic ages of authors. When we disaggregate these analyses by, say, seniority of retracted authors, we don’t find these patterns in all cases, but overall, these trends describe the results in broad strokes.</p>



<p><strong>RW: How do you account for the growth of collaboration networks for researchers who have retracted their work and continued to publish?  We have written in the past about “</strong><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/25/science-self-refereed/"><strong>trust dividends</strong></a><strong>” that seem to accrue to researchers who retract for honest error. Is the same thing at work here?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Makovi</strong>: This is a great question, which our data can not address directly, and where qualitative work and future research would be helpful. Here are two hypotheses, which address this question from either the supply or the demand side of collaborators. </p>



<p>On the demand side, retracted authors might change their strategy in seeking collaborators. Specifically, prior research has documented that having a retraction might have a stigmatizing effect, and as we and others have shown, has negative impacts on various career outcomes. To counteract these, some retracted authors might act particularly agentically seeking collaborators to increase the volume and impact of their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The supply side may be how the environment around the retracted author changes: Senior colleagues in one’s department might become especially agentic in bringing retracted authors on as collaborators, especially if their retractions were due to a mistake, and/or if the retracted author experienced a retraction early on during their career. They might broker connections to help them along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these remain hypotheses that we are unable to test with the data at hand. There could be other explanations as well, therefore, we would take this explanation with a heap of salt, as it points beyond the analysis we conducted in the paper.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Were you able to tease out whether specific authors in your dataset had responsibility for the factors that led to retraction? And were you able to observe and study a “bystander effect”?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Makovi: </strong>This is an excellent question, and I wish we had a straightforward answer. As part of our analysis we trained a large group of students to identify and hand-code retraction notices to categorize retraction reasons, and collect other data, for instance if the retraction was led by authors or journal editors. In the process we have read many retraction notices ourselves. It is a rare occasion that the notice doles out responsibility to specific authors. We only found a handful where this was the case. </p>



<p>What we have done is a disaggregation of our findings by author position, separating first, last and middle authors, which correlate with the typical roles in a paper, but we would not find it convincing to base “responsibility” on this. This, again, is an aspect where more qualitative work would come in handy.</p>



<p><strong>RW: Your study focuses on papers retracted between 1990 and 2015, and includes data up through 2021. Since then, the number of papers has gone up and so has the retraction rate. How do you think things may have changed since your analysis and since the cutoff of your datasets?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AlShebli:</strong> We focused on this period to allow for a long enough observation window, up to five years after retraction, to assess career outcomes like collaboration patterns and attrition. Since then, several dynamics may have changed. For one, there’s been increased awareness and transparency around research integrity, and platforms like Retraction Watch have expanded coverage, possibly shifting the norms around retraction and its stigma. At the same time, with the rise of open science and preprints, new challenges around reproducibility and misconduct have also emerged. Not to mention the newly available AI tools that might shape how authors write, cite and conduct research more generally. These changes could affect both the frequency of retractions and how they impact scientists’ careers.</p>



<p>That said, while the scale has grown, we believe that many of the structural dynamics we document, like career attrition or collaboration loss, might still hold today. We hope future research, using newer data, will build on our findings to track how these patterns evolve over time.</p>



<p><strong>Retraction Watch: Two of you (AlShebli and Makovi) </strong><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/21/nature-communications-retracts-much-criticized-paper-on-mentorship/"><strong>had a paper retracted</strong></a><strong>, which you mention in a note at the end of the paper. How did that experience inform this study? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AlShebli:</strong> Yes, two of us experienced a shared retraction firsthand, and we felt it was important to be transparent about that in the paper. That experience gave us a personal understanding of how painful and disorienting the process can be. We were very fortunate to have strong support from our colleagues and peers, which helped us recover and continue our research. But our experience, as the data shows, could have been very different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That contrast really motivated this study. We wanted to understand how retractions affect scientists more broadly, especially early-career researchers, and to highlight the structural factors that can either mitigate or exacerbate the impact. Ultimately, our hope is to inform an evidence-based approach to research integrity that is perhaps more compassionate.</p>



<p><strong>RW:  How can scientists help early-career researchers move beyond a retraction?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AlShebli:</strong> Retractions are a necessary self-correcting mechanism of science and scientific progress. They are meted out collectively, and as an institution, we do not believe that retractions should be done away with. The challenge lies in communicating what they mean to the public, and to fellow scientists. Our findings highlight just how vulnerable early-career researchers are in the wake of a retraction. They face higher rates of career attrition which can derail promising trajectories.</p>



<p>One possible takeaway is that institutions, funders, and senior collaborators need to be more proactive in distinguishing between culpability and proximity. When early-career scientists are caught up in retractions they didn’t cause, they need support systems, such as mentorship, opportunities to re-establish their credibility, and clear institutional statements where appropriate. Transparency in responsibility and a culture that allows for recovery, rather than guilt by association, are crucial to protecting the next generation of researchers.</p>

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Manal Helal will talk about her work in the presentation entitled &quot;When the Robotic Maths Tutor is Wrong - Can Children Identify Mistakes Generated by ChatGPT?&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This study delves into integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT-
powered robots, as educational tools in primary school mathematics. Against the backdrop
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating educational settings, our
investigation focuses on the response of young learners to errors made by these LLM-
powered robots. Employing a user study approach, we conducted an experiment using the
Pepper robot in a primary school classroom environment, where 77 primary school students
from multiple grades (Year 3 to 5) took part in interacting with the robot. Our
statistically significant findings highlight that most students, regardless of the year
group, could discern between correct and incorrect responses generated by the robots,
demonstrating a promising level of understanding and engagement with the AI-driven
educational tool. Additionally, we observed that students' correctness in answering the
Maths questions significantly influenced their ability to identify errors, underscoring
the importance of prior knowledge in verifying LLM responses and detecting errors.
Additionally, we examined potential confounding factors such as age and gender. Our
findings underscore the importance of gradually integrating AI-powered educational tools
under the guidance of domain experts following thorough verification processes. Moreover,
our study calls for further research to establish best practices for implementing AI-
driven pedagogical approaches in educational settings.</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal is investigating a paper by a controversial author after a Retraction Watch inquiry about the article. The article concluded that “placebo effects have a significant impact on observed outcomes” in both placebo and treatment groups in clinical trials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The senior author of the paper is Harald Walach, whose name <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=harald+walach">may be familiar</a>. In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/02/journal-retracts-paper-claiming-two-deaths-from-covid-19-vaccination-for-every-three-prevented-cases/">one paper</a>, now retracted, Walach and his coauthors claimed COVID-19 vaccines killed two people for every three deaths they prevented. In a different <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/16/jama-journal-retracts-paper-on-masks-for-children/">paper</a>, also retracted, Walach and his colleagues claimed children’s masks trap carbon dioxide; they later <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/01/one-would-not-want-to-tarnish-another-journal-why-a-republished-covid-19-masks-study-doesnt-say-it-was-retracted/">republished</a> the article in a different journal. He <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dWalach%252c%2bHarald">lost two papers</a> and a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/07/university-terminates-affiliation-with-researcher-who-had-paper-on-covid-19-vaccines-retracted-as-mask-study-comes-under-scrutiny/">university affiliation</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of his latest papers, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435624004141#bib11">Treatment effects in pharmacological clinical randomized controlled trials are mainly due to placebo</a>,” appeared online December 27 in the <em>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131842"></span>



<p>Walach’s group analyzed 30 clinical trials for each of five conditions — osteoarthritis, depression, migraines, sleep disorders and irritable bowel syndrome — and analyzed the improvement in both the placebo and treatment groups. The authors conclude “that the placebo-effect is the major driver of treatment effects in clinical trials that alone explains 69% of the variance.”</p>



<p>Stephen Rhodes, a researcher at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in Ohio, criticized the study in a <a href="https://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(25)00055-1/abstract">letter to the editor in February</a>, citing a “number of errors that lead to some sweeping conclusions.” In the letter, Rhodes wrote those leaps “reflect a misunderstanding of what a ‘treatment effect’ is,” noting that in a placebo-controlled trial, the measure can’t be “due to placebo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked <a href="https://gidmk.medium.com/">Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Gideon+Meyerowitz-Katz">a sleuth</a> and research fellow at the University of Wollongong in Australia, to take a look at the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz called the work “bizarre” and told us the results seem to indicate “simply being in a clinical trial is the main component of healing.” The studies included in the analysis had “very low average treatment effects,” meaning they didn’t show a huge benefit for the interventions tested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The clinical trials included had another issue: one was <a href="https://www.jrheum.org/content/45/12/1713.2">retracted in 2018</a> after journal editors realized&nbsp; all its participants had been enrolled and randomized <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/18/this-is-something-that-we-have-never-seen-before-in-any-study-group-loses-two-more-papers/">on the same day</a>. “I do not think that a meta-analysis which includes work retracted nearly a decade ago can be relied on as evidence,” Meyerowitz-Katz said.</p>



<p>When he attempted to replicate the methods, Meyerowitz-Katz wasn’t able to do so. The researchers claimed to have taken one of the formulas from a <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-8-52">previous paper</a>; however, the referenced paper used a regression model, and the formula was not listed, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz also pointed out a potential undisclosed conflict of interest. Walach runs the <a href="https://chs-institute.org/">Change Health Science Institute</a>, which <a href="https://chs-institute.org/news/50-verschwoerungstheorie.html">promotes</a> “homeopathy and various COVID-19 conspiracy theories,” he said.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prof_Dr_Harald_Walach.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="417" height="323" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prof_Dr_Harald_Walach.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-122498" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prof_Dr_Harald_Walach.jpeg 417w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Prof_Dr_Harald_Walach-300x232.jpeg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Harald Walach</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Walach, in response to Meyerowitz-Katz’s comments, called the term “conspiracy theory” “an analytically void terminology, because it is dependent on the political mainstream view, which is in turn dependent on political power.”</p>



<p>He did not respond to any of Meyerowitz-Katz’s critiques of the paper.</p>



<p>Meyerowitz-Katz touched on many of the same issues Rhodes had raised in his letter. Rhodes questioned if the results really suggest there is “limited space for effects due to pharmacological substances,” quoting from the original paper. He also wrote by weighing clinical trials by study size rather than standard deviation, the researchers are “throwing information away.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers responded to Rhodes in their own letter to the editor, conceding they should have used “treatment response” rather than “treatment effect” in the title “to avoid confusion.” The authors also argued they had demonstrated “whenever a treatment is very effective, so is the improvement in the placebo group and vice versa.”</p>



<p>Retraction Watch sent questions to the <em>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</em>, including the above critiques of the paper. <a href="https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/tricco-andrea-catherine/">Andrea Tricco</a>, the co-editor-in-chief of the publication, told us the journal was investigating the concerns and was “treating this as a matter of highest urgency.”</p>



<p>Stefan Schmidt, the corresponding author of the paper, told us his group has been asked to give “a detailed reply within 30 days.”</p>
