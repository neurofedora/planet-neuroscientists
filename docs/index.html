<p>A team of researchers in Belgium got more than they expected when they tried to study potato pathogens: an unwelcome contaminant, a retraction, and a new paper the authors say is “an improvement over the first.”</p>



<p>In a now-retracted <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfae004">paper</a> in <em>Metallomics </em>originally published in January 2024, researchers at the University of Liège described how availability of nitrogen and iron changes how the bacterium responsible for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12230-017-9575-3">potato common scab</a> interacts with each of the two microorganisms responsible for early and late blight while infecting the same host. The results suggested the bacterium had antimicrobial properties against both microbes, with nearly all of the experiments focusing on the fungus that causes late blight. </p>



<p>After publication, the authors realized their strain of the late blight-causing microorganism was not the one described in the paper. While the lab originally received the correct strain, “the plates became contaminated, and the fungal contaminant eventually overgrew the strain we intended to study,” <a href="https://www.rigalilab.be/">Sébastien Rigali</a>, corresponding author and professor at the University of Liège, told Retraction Watch. </p>



<span id="more-133445"></span>



<p>Sample contamination in the lab is an ever-present problem for researchers and has led to the retraction of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/05/26/two-japanese-universities-revoke-phds-one-for-plagiarism-and-one-because-of-cell-line-contamination/">multiple</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186281">papers</a>. For studies using cell lines, resources such as the <a href="https://iclac.org/databases/cross-contaminations/">ICLAC Register of Misidentified Cell Lines</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/30/can-a-nudge-stop-researchers-from-using-the-wrong-cell-lines/">Research Resource Identifiers</a> can help scientists prevent the use of tainted cells. Fungal contamination during preparation and experiments is such a common problem that many <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/biological-contamination.html#fungus">cell</a> <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/cell-culture-and-cell-culture-analysis/mammalian-cell-culture/cell-culture-troubleshooting-contamination?srsltid=AfmBOooTpf9yl3ivVgv6IwawYxh8vUP63gNR7IY1KTMHVi5g1206on_W#microbial">culture</a> <a href="https://www.ptglab.com/support/cell-culture-protocol/cell-contamination/?srsltid=AfmBOooVHZGhbjKEFORFRxNdO-Mt5h0UGvBQJvNnjzohVM4bpCux35GX#Fungal%20(yeast/mold)%20contamination">guidelines</a> include a section on how to handle it.</p>



<p>For the fungus cultures used in the <em>Metallomics </em>study, genome sequencing confirmed the actual strain wasn’t the one described in the paper. “Because our work focused on macroscopic phenotypes, we did not initially notice the contamination; the original strain and the contaminant looked similar on Petri dishes,” Rigali told us in an email. Later, he examined the samples using electron microscopy and “realized the morphology was not as expected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He and his collaborators contacted the journal to request the retraction of the paper, as “the data themselves were scientifically sound, but the biological narrative was wrong because we were unknowingly working with an unintended organism.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even with great care and the best working conditions, mistakes can still occur,” said Rigali. “What would have been far worse is failing to detect the contamination and allowing an incorrect story to remain published.”</p>



<p>The paper was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfae021">retracted</a> in April 2024, less than four months after its publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All collaborators responded unanimously that ‘these things happen,’ emphasizing that what truly mattered was that we retracted the paper almost immediately after publication and submitted a revised version, which we all agree is an improvement over the first,” Rigali said.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfae048">replacement paper</a> was published in <em>Metallomics</em> in October 2024. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mtomcs/mfaf037">retraction notice</a> was updated in November 2025 to note the replacement, “which now accurately refers to the correct strain,” the notice states. The new paper’s “objectives and context are properly aligned and more focused on specific environmental nutrients that trigger the antifungal activity of <em>Streptomyces scabiei</em>”— the potato scab-causing bacteria — “through iron deprivation.”</p>



<p>Often the retraction, replacement, and notice are published simultaneously in cases like these, Katherine J. Franz, editor-in-chief of <em>Metallomics</em>,<em> </em>told us. “This time there was a gap between the retraction and the revised version being published, and the revised version is now available,” she said.</p>



<p>Franz added, “My advice to other scientists who may find similar problems is to deal with the issue professionally and honestly so as to uphold the rigor of the scientific process.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/rebecca-sear">Rebecca Sear</a> is on a mission to convince publishers to retract articles that use a database that purports to rank countries based on intelligence.</p>



<p>To maintain the integrity of scientific literature, the professor of psychology at Brunel University of London and her colleagues are writing to journals that are publishing papers that rely on the so-called National IQ database, which aims to rank countries based on intelligence. It has drawn criticism for the way the data were collected. Sear’s efforts have so far led to two retractions.</p>



<p>“There is absolutely no scientific merit whatsoever in the National IQ database,” Sear told Retraction Watch. “That means that any conclusions drawn from the database will be faulty and worthless.”</p>



<span id="more-133404"></span>



<p>The database was first published in 2002 after psychologists Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen constructed what they claimed were averaged estimates of IQ scores for different countries. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/revealed-international-race-science-network-secretly-funded-by-us-tech-boss">Critics say</a> the database fueled networks of “race science” activists who argue Western countries are under threat from certain ethnic groups with low intelligence and higher propensity to commit crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Lynn, a self-proclaimed “scientific racist,” was stripped of his emeritus status by Ulster University in Northern Ireland after students protested against his views, as we<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/08/08/prof-who-lost-emeritus-status-for-views-on-race-and-intelligence-has-paper-flagged/"><em> </em>reported</a>. <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1#?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3d1%26auth%3dRichard%2bLynn">By our count</a>, three of Lynn’s papers have been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/08/08/prof-who-lost-emeritus-status-for-views-on-race-and-intelligence-has-paper-flagged/">flagged with expressions of concern</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Sear hasn’t tracked how many papers Lynn — who died in 2023 — himself authored, she is tracking the number of studies using his dataset. She <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_deyyZUrcZNNSZZfHYbC5tRW4IWqSRWZ1KveIoLyOo/edit?gid=0#gid=0">shared a list</a> with us that as of now contains 174 such studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest retraction was issued November 2 by <em>Cross-Cultural Research</em>, which pulled a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10693971221143577">2023 study</a> Sear had flagged. The paper, “Likely Electromagnetic Foundations of Gender Inequality,” has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10693971221143577">retraction notice</a> doesn’t identify Sear by name but acknowledges she raised the concerns. It states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Given the concerns raised by the reader, and that the original round of peer review did not meet the journal’s standards, the Journal Editor and Sage conducted a post-publication peer review of this article. Sage contacted the author for comments on the concerns raised.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Study author <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FRAzlFEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Federico R. León</a> of the San Ignacio de Loyola University in Lima, Peru, agreed to the retraction, the notice states. He did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other retraction prompted by Sear’s reporting, which we<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/18/do-some-iq-data-need-a-public-health-warning-a-paper-based-on-a-controversial-psychologists-data-is-retracted/"> covered</a> when it occurred last year, was for a 2010 paper about intelligence and infections published by the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sear told us she has written to editors at 18 journals that have published papers using the IQ database. So far, however, her efforts have led to just those two retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The others, I was either ignored or just brushed off by the editors or publishers concerned on the whole,” she said. “I genuinely thought that when concerns were raised about research integrity of papers, something would be done, and that’s not the case.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The dataset isn’t well known outside psychology, Sear noted, so editors from journals from other disciplines may not know that it is “fundamentally flawed,” she said. According to <a href="https://jeltewicherts.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wichertsravenafr2010rej.pdf">one 2010 critique</a>, which failed to replicate the database’s low IQ estimates for Africans, Lynn’s methods for selecting data were “unsystematic” and “too unspecific to allow replication,” the authors wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Prof-Richard-Lynn-7651.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="967" height="1024" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Prof-Richard-Lynn-7651-967x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-105703" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Prof-Richard-Lynn-7651-967x1024.jpg 967w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Prof-Richard-Lynn-7651-283x300.jpg 283w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Prof-Richard-Lynn-7651-768x813.jpg 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Prof-Richard-Lynn-7651.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Richard Lynn</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/j-m-wicherts">Jelte Wicherts</a>, a statistician and methodologist at Tilburg University in the Netherlands who coauthored that 2010 critique, told us that although Lynn’s colleague, David Becker, has since addressed some methodological issues, the updated iterations of the database are still flawed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Becker’s NIQ database inherited many of the fundamental flaws in Lynn’s original national IQ work that we showed quite clearly to be unsystematic and biased towards Lynn’s expectations,” Wicherts told us. “Until it has been validated with rigorous means, I would not recommend the use of Becker’s IQ data in peer-reviewed research.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/hsw/psychologie/professuren/entwpsy/team/becker/becker.php.en">Becker</a>, now based at the Chemnitz University of Technology in Saxony, Germany, did not respond to a request for a comment.</p>



<p>However, one researcher who has multiple studies on Sear’s list and spoke to Retraction Watch on the condition of anonymity, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>At the time those papers were written, I was not fully aware of the depth of the controversy on that topic and its connection to racialized interpretations of intelligence. Researchers in developing countries are far from such debates, they are under more pressure to publish more research papers. So, my focus then was on contributing to empirical growth and development research, <strong>not on questions of race</strong>. I stopped using it and publishing papers in impact factor journals and have not relied on it in my more recent research.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Lynn dataset never met the “minimal standards” for being published, even when it was collected, said <a href="https://webapps.unf.edu/faculty/bio/N01440659">Gregory Kohn</a>, an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of North Florida. “I think there is a burgeoning consensus that is long overdue, that this dataset was not collected in a disciplined way to make any reasonable conclusions,” Kohn said.</p>



<p>Last December, publishing giant Elsevier said it was reviewing papers its journals had published in the past using the dataset. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/10/elsevier-reviews-national-iq-research-by-british-race-scientist-richard-lynn">the <em>Guardian</em></a>, Lynn had published more than 100 papers in Elsevier journals, including several iterations of the NIQ database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An Elsevier spokesperson told us: “In line with our commitment to investigate this matter thoroughly, we invited prominent members of the scientific community to aid us in gathering a consensus on the flaws in the national IQ database and other similar projects. This piece of work is nearing completion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">One study on Sear’s list is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289618302435?via%3Dihub">2019 paper</a> published by the journal <em>Intelligence</em>, which explored the link between national IQ and scores on a graduate admissions exam&nbsp; that was co-authored by psychologist Bryan Pesta.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On November 4, a U.S. appeals court <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/professor-loses-appeal-over-firing-for-racial-iq-gap-article">dismissed an appeal</a> from Pesta, who was stripped of his tenure and fired by Cleveland State University after his colleagues claimed he engaged in research misconduct by misrepresenting his intended use of data from the National Institutes of Health to advance a theory that genetic differences lead to a racial IQ gap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Pesta <a href="https://quillette.com/2022/12/16/and-yet-it-may-or-may-not-move/">has argued</a> his academic freedom had been violated, the <a href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/25a0511n-06.pdf">court found</a> that, “Whatever the controversial nature of [Pesta’s work], CSU officials were reasonably alarmed by Pesta’s cavalier handling of sensitive genomic data, misleading representations to the NIH about the nature of his research, failure to observe basic conflict-of-interest reporting, and the impact that his actions had on CSU as a research institution reliant on the NIH.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Cleveland State told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The ruling confirms that the university and its employees acted properly and that the law and facts support our position. We strongly believe our faculty are entitled to full freedom in their research, but they must adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity and professional ethics.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sear said&nbsp; journals should retract every paper based on Lynn’s database.&nbsp; “Every paper that is published using the database effectively justifies the use of the database,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lynn’s work is systematically biased, Sear said, because it has unrepresentative samples — with relatively higher rural populations and numbers of children for some nations — leading to a skewed picture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So as long as papers which have used the database sit in literature, that will make it easier for people to continue using a worthless database,” she says. “Retracting these articles is particularly important in order to essentially stop the continued use of the dataset.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are pleased to announce that Schmidt Sciences and NASA have generously awarded arXiv $7 million in gifts and grants, respectively, to allow arXiv to complete its technology migration project and to explore ways to improve the arXiv experience through personalized and fair discovery of new preprints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv began its cloud migration and code modernization project in 2023 with support from the Simons Foundation. This additional funding from Schmidt Sciences will allow arXiv to maintain an expanded software development team and complete the modernization effort without impacting ongoing operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schmidt Sciences is thrilled to help support arXiv migrate to modern, scalable cloud technology, and ensure it can sustainably meet the accelerating demands of the global research community,&#8221; said James Ricci, director of Science Systems at Schmidt Sciences. “We hope that this will continue advancing open science for years to come.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-funds-open-source-software-underpinning-scientific-innovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through funding from NASA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, faculty members in Cornell University’s Department of Computer Science will build and evaluate discovery and dissemination tools that are fairer and more effective than existing methods. NASA funding will also equip arXiv to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand into subject areas of interest to NASA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am profoundly grateful for this generous support from both Schmidt Sciences and NASA,” said</span><a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/people/greg-morrisett/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Morrisett</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of Cornell Tech. “This investment will ensure that arXiv can grow sustainably and continue to serve the needs of the global research community well into the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“arXiv is in the midst of a technology transformation to meet future challenges, and to respond effectively to changes affecting the research community.

<p>At Prince Sultan University in Saudi Arabia, faculty members must help raise their school’s academic standing not by doing impactful work, but by citing the institution’s research in their papers, according to a document Retraction Watch has obtained.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/prince-sultan-university-ahmed-yamani-memo-scaled.png">interoffice memo</a> from 2022, <a href="https://www.psu.edu.sa/en/CSC-profile-ahmed-yamani">Ahmed Yamani</a>, president of the Riyadh-based institution, referred to “the rule of the requirement of citing 3-4 relevant publications in each paper” whose aim was “increasing the exposure of PSU research work and increasing the total number of PSU citations.”</p>



<p>Coordinated citation efforts can boost the rankings of <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">institutions</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02639-9">individual researchers</a>. The Committee on Publication Ethics considers <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/discussion-document/citation-manipulation">citation manipulation unethical</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133395"></span>



<p>The memo, titled “Follow-up on publication fees and incentives 2023,” added, “If no PSU publication is related to the paper to be submitted, the PSU authors do not need to cite the PSU papers.” It continued, “We urge faculty members to cooperate in raising PSU citations and impact.”</p>



<p>Yamani did not reply to requests for comment.</p>



<p>We have reported in the past on coercive citation at Iraqi universities, where both <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/17/exclusive-iraqi-university-forcing-students-to-cite-its-journals-to-graduate/">students</a> and<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/27/mustansiriyah-university-iraq-researchers-must-cite-colleagues-school-journals-in-papers/"> researchers</a> are required to cite their institutions’ journals and research.  </p>

<p>The Saudi policy differs by including the clause on relevance – an apparent nod to intellectual freedom and research integrity, said <a href="https://spp.gatech.edu/people/person/diana-hicks">Diana Hicks</a>, an expert in publication metrics and a professor emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.</p>



<p>Despite this, she told us, “it certainly feels like mandating metrics gaming and so would encourage a culture not focused on integrity.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/ludo-waltman/activiti">Ludo Waltman</a>, an expert in research assessment at Leiden University in The Netherlands, agreed, calling Prince Sultan’s citation requirement “highly problematic.”</p>



<p>“Because of the ‘relevance’ criterion, this perhaps doesn’t constitute coercive citation in a strict sense, but in a practical sense this memo puts strong pressure on PSU researchers to cite work from their own university, so this is very close to coercion,” he told us. “It is also problematic that the ‘relevance’ criterion states that PSU researchers don’t need to cite<strong> </strong>PSU work if they cannot find relevant work. The criterion should state that PSU researchers must not cite<strong> </strong>PSU work if it is not relevant.”</p>



<p>The memo referred to feedback received from the school’s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251119102734/https:/ric.psu.edu.sa/our-team.php"> Research and Initiatives Center</a> on “the publication fees for 2023.” To be reimbursed for publication fees, the memo stated, 40 percent of a paper’s authors must be faculty members at the university. Whether this policy is meant to prevent the school’s researchers from being gifted authorship simply to help pay publication fees is unclear.</p>



<p>Earlier this fall,<a href="https://facultyportal.psu.edu.sa/ViewProfile.aspx?instructorID=1052"> Mohamed Bououdina</a>, a<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=nVGQSU8AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate"> hyperprolific</a> physicist and administrator at Prince Sultan, lost<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024015524"> a 2024 paper</a> in <em>Heliyon</em> due to the addition of eight irrelevant citations, according to the<a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(25)02480-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2405844025024806%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"> retraction notice</a>.</p>



<p>Elsevier, the journal’s publisher, would not tell us which citations it found irrelevant. But at least<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1158399/full"> two</a><a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admi.202202404"> references</a> coauthored by fellow Prince Sultan physicist<a href="https://facultyportal.psu.edu.sa/ViewProfile.aspx?instructorID=1052"> Mohammed Benali Kanoun</a> could qualify. The works are cited after a sentence stating nanomaterials ”are more hydrophobic than conventional bone grafts,” although neither reference mentions hydrophobicity or bone grafts.</p>



<p>Bououdina, who is<a href="https://www.psu.edu.sa/en/directory"> an aide to the university’s president</a> and associate director of the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251119102734/https:/ric.psu.edu.sa/our-team.php"> Research and Initiatives Center</a>, also has earned a<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402617300876"> retraction</a> for<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/E24F0B198E1F13DE757526749E82F5"> using tortured phrases suggestive of plagiarism</a> in another paper. He has had<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/CCCAFCFE34E19C69ACB4F85904DB74"> several papers flagged</a> on PubPeer, including for potential<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6DFADAA76FFD34A8EC65F1699D09A8"> image</a><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A737C1219ADE6818F5C2DAD021ABA6"> manipulation</a> and<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B776374962262979F9C1D70AA65E91"> data fabrication</a>. Bououdina did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Waltman said he did not know how common institutional self-citation policies are. But he stressed that ”choosing citations politically, rather than purely based on relevance, is not specific to particular countries or regions. This is done by researchers all over the world, but usually in more subtle ways, without explicit policies that mandate this.”</p>

Created with BioRender. Simpson, S., Jinich, A. (2025). BioRender.com/ryzs1cd.</span><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Before offering my own opinion, here's how the authors presented their work to the public:<br /><br /><a href="#"></a><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/groundbreaking-study-reveals-future-medicine-131000164.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GROUNDBREAKING RESULTS: THE DISCOVERY THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING</a>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>--</b></span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>This is from a paid press release.&nbsp;</b></span></span></p><p></p><blockquote><p>The landmark study demonstrates how intensive meditation can trigger the same profound brain activity previously documented only with psychedelic substances – while simultaneously activating measurable biological transformations throughout the entire body.&nbsp;</p><p>In just seven days, without any pharmaceutical intervention, retreat participants achieved what researchers are calling a "biological reset" – rewired neural networks, boosted cellular nerve cell growth, reprogrammed cellular energy systems, and activated natural pain-relief mechanisms. Research data also shows study subjects' "mystical experience" scores – measured via self-reporting – increased significantly in a group of 20 individuals within the seven-day event.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>OK then. Well... My take is different. I suggest some of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence,&nbsp;based on procedural and analytic flaws that occur throughout the manuscript and supplementary materials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Claim 1. Enhanced Neuroplasticity (greater neurite outgrowth)</b></p><p></p><blockquote>“Participants’ anecdotal reports consistently emphasize radical psychological breakthroughs, and previous meditation studies have reported increased BDNF levels consistent with enhanced neuroplasticity. To investigate whether the intervention affected circulating plasma factors conducive to neuroplasticity, we treated cultured glutamatergic PC12 neuroendocrine cells with NGF (nerve growth factor) and 1% pre- and post-intervention plasma and quantiﬁed neurite outgrowth length.”</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Result 1. PC12 cells treated with plasma from all 20 participants</b></p><p>PC12 cells are <i>not</i> primarily glutaminergic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC12_cell_line" target="_blank">PC12</a> is a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma (tumor) of the rat adrenal gland. The cells <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2022.1016559/full">synthesize, store, and release catecholamines</a>. PC12 cells can be induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells. When treated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor" target="_blank">NGF</a>, they extend neurite-like processes. Subsequent treatment with a variety of agents can elucidate specific cellular mechanisms.</p><p>Here, a problematic choice was that plasma from all 20 participants was combined into one soup, which eliminated individual variation and prevented mechanistic insights. Further, p<span lang="EN">lasma samples from novice and advanced meditators (who showed different molecular
profiles in other analyses) were pooled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p><b>Claim 2. Metabolic Reprogramming (shift toward glycolytic metabolism)</b><p></p><blockquote>“Previous studies have characterized meditation as a hypometabolic state and reported enhanced glycolysis in Tibetan Buddhist monks. To test the intervention’s effect on real-time metabolism, we treated BE(2)M17 human neuroblastoma cells with 1% plasma from all participants for 60 min and performed Seahorse XF assays.”</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strike><b>Result 2A. Pooled Plasma (loss of individual metabolic signatures)</b></strike><p><strike>Once again, the&nbsp;<span lang="EN">claim of&nbsp;</span>“<span lang="EN">significant</span>”</strike><span lang="EN"><strike>&nbsp;changes
in glycolysis is based on comparing two pooled samples (basically n=1 vs. n=1). We can't determine
which plasma components (or which individual participants) drove the metabolic changes.</strike>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #800180; font-family: arial; font-size: medium;"><b>*</b></span></p><b>Result 2B. Preselected Proteins (Fig. 4E, glycolysis proteomics heat map)</b><p>The authors didn't explain their criteria for choosing&nbsp;19 proteins involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (out of hundreds). Was the selection biased in some way? Were important proteins missing?</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Claim 3. Modulation of Functional Cell Signaling Pathways&nbsp;</b><b>(proteomics</b><b>)</b></p><p></p><blockquote>“To investigate the intervention’s effects on the plasma proteome, 7596 proteins were quantified with the SomaScan Assay v4.1.&nbsp; &nbsp;...&nbsp; Volcano plot analysis (Fig. 5A) revealed 21 significantly altered proteins.&nbsp;Coﬁlin-2 (COF2) and Enoyl-CoA hydratase were significantly upregulated, which suggests enhanced cellular processes related to cytoskeletal regulation and fatty acid metabolism.”</blockquote>&nbsp;<p></p><p><b>Result 3A. Only 21 out of 7596 proteins were significantly altered (far <i>less</i> than chance)</b></p><p>How did that happen?? The proteomic and metabolomic analyses were exploratory and hypothesis-free, but... with 7,596 proteins tested at p &lt; .05, the expected number of false positives is ~380 proteins (5% of 7,596). <b><span style="color: #cc0000;">Statistical correction for multiple comparisons was inconsistently applied across measures</span><span style="color: red;">.</span></b> Even within the Proteomics category, Table 5 says p&lt;.05 but the Methods (p. 14) indicate that FDR correction was applied (false discovery rate).<br /><b><br />Result 3B. Tiny Effect Size (Fig. 5A, linear fold change of 0.25 in either direction)</b>&nbsp;</p><p>This means there was only a 25% increase or decrease in these proteins after the retreat, which may be within technical or biological noise levels. Most studies require at least 1.5 fold changes for biological relevance. Elsewhere, for the protein-protein interaction networks in Fig. 5B, they used either p&lt;.05 OR fold change &gt;.5, which is still problematic. Use more stringent criteria instead (FDR &lt; 0.05 AND fold change &gt; 1.5).</p><p><b style="color: #cc0000;">Across the entire study, the chance of false positive results is high.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Claim 4. Upregulation of Anti-Inflammatory <i>and</i> Inflammatory Markers (dynamic process of immune modulation)</b><br /></p><blockquote>“To assess whether the intervention elicited inﬂammatory or anti-inﬂammatory cascades, we examined a panel of 23 inﬂammatory and 21 anti-inﬂammatory proteins (Fig. 5E). We found significant upregulation of inﬂammatory markers ... Interestingly, we also observed a significantly upregulated anti-inﬂammatory markers index...  Concurrent activation of both pathways suggests a dynamic process of immune modulation, possibly reﬂecting enhanced cellular turnover or repair mechanisms.”</blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Result 4A. Upregulation of Inflammatory Markers is Bad (negative effects of&nbsp;</b><b>the retreat?)</b></p><p>This result is certainly the opposite of what would be expected. Some studies suggest that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4940234/" target="_blank">meditation can&nbsp;<i>reduce</i> inflammatory markers</a> (lower IL-6, TNF-α, CRP, etc.).&nbsp;For an intervention that ostensibly promotes well-being and neuroplasticity, increased inflammation is counterintuitive and potentially harmful. The authors didn't consider alternative explanations, such as:&nbsp;</p><p>

Alterations in Functional Brain Activity (related to meditation)</b></p><blockquote>“To characterize the neural signature of the meditative state, participants underwent structural and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI scans during rest (5 min) and meditation (15 min).&nbsp;<br />...<br />fMRI data showed that this meditation style functionally disrupts the default mode and salience networks (responsible for self-referential thought and allostatic regulation) and cerebellum-prefrontal predictive processing circuits involved in integrating internal models with external sensory data.”</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Result 5A.

(difference between rest and meditation)</b></p><p>During the 5 minute resting state scan, participants were told to “not move, keep eyes open, stay awake, and think about whatever you want, but do not meditate.”&nbsp; During the 15 minute meditation scan, participants were instructed to “not move, listen to the guided meditation soundtrack, and meditate as suggested by the audio while keeping your eyes open.”</p><p>A few things:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The guided meditation has a <a href="https://drjoedispenza.com/product-details/Blessings%20From%20the%20Brain%20%E2%80%93%20Blessing%20of%20the%20Energy%20Centers%20XI" target="_blank">bombastic audio soundtrack</a>, while the resting state is silent&nbsp;</li><li>It would have been beneficial to compare auditory cortex activity for meditation vs. rest</li><li>Breathing exercises during meditation can increase head movement</li></ul><p>The authors admit this show-stopping confound of greater head motion during the meditation scan.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“<b><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Participants moved more during meditation than rest, a potential confound</span></b> revealed by the significant effect of task (meditation, rest) on mean framewise displacement on a two-way (task × time) repeated measures ANOVA (n = 19, F(1,18) = 25.1, p = 0.00009, η²p = 0.58).”</blockquote><p><b><span style="color: #cc0000;">Thus, the functional connectivity differences between meditation and rest could explained by head motion, not by changes in brain activity.</span></b>&nbsp;Even tiny movements (0.5 mm) create spurious correlations between regions. The effect size above indicates that 58% of variance in movement was explained by meditation vs. rest. The whopping p-value above was reported in the abstract, but in a different context:</p><p></p><blockquote>“Meditation decreases&nbsp;functional integration in the default mode (p = 0.00009) and salience networks (p = 0.000003).”</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Result 5C. Errors in the Framewise Displacement Spreadsheet (supplementary material)</b></p><p>Framewise displacement (FD) is a quality control metric that considers changes in six head motion parameters from one frame to the next. The authors said their results&nbsp;“were robust to excluding BOLD&nbsp;runs with mean framewise displacement &gt; 0.3 mm, indicating they were not due to higher meditation-associated head motion.” I wasn't sure what they meant by "run" (an entire 5 min block? how many blocks tossed? why wasn't a more stringent cutoff used?).&nbsp;</p><p>At any rate, the Supplementary Material lists a temporal string of FD values for all subjects and conditions. Some numbers in the spreadsheet looked like this, '0.5053053200000001 (an extraneous apostrophe) while the pre and post values for the Rest condition were identical, suggesting some kind of copy/paste error (see screenshot below).<br /><br /> </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpI97mXyCv9CJw7I8QVORfR3QD9wURFzCM-2uk5VEx5U5LUN-amj48u2maaT_369e-ia2u8mXx-0xMfHM047zzxZb7qx_tg-UnFppoRbnYynpLbYw3sHiGXgHD1Q6FFmKq85ocLI5LGqDRVQDt5qhHtmdBm68vDd0rXTdDbig_J7otgp4vASwD/s864/FD%20excel.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="383" data-original-width="864" height="178" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpI97mXyCv9CJw7I8QVORfR3QD9wURFzCM-2uk5VEx5U5LUN-amj48u2maaT_369e-ia2u8mXx-0xMfHM047zzxZb7qx_tg-UnFppoRbnYynpLbYw3sHiGXgHD1Q6FFmKq85ocLI5LGqDRVQDt5qhHtmdBm68vDd0rXTdDbig_J7otgp4vASwD/w400-h178/FD%20excel.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><p><b>Claim 6. Machine Learning Models Discriminated Pre- and Post-Meditation States with High Accuracy</b></p><p></p><blockquote>“We applied machine learning to identify the most biologically relevant features across time point (pre/post) and experience level (novice/advanced) datasets. Each dataset was preprocessed (log-transformed and auto-centered) and missing data was imputed to ensure feature scaling, normalization consistency, and data integrity and comparability across modalities. Post-preprocessing, ELISA, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics datasets were concatenated into a single feature matrix used as input for an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data.  ...    both models achieved strong discrimination between pre- and post-meditation states (XGBoost AUC = 0.86; Random Forest AUC = 0.90).”</blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Result 6. Extreme Overfitting (with no way to validate in an independent sample)</b></p><p></p><p><i><b>Unless I'm mistaken</b></i>, they dumped ALL the data, including ~36,500 fMRI features, into one giant classifier. This guarantees overfitting. With 100,000 features and 20 samples, the model can memorize the training data. In contrast, <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-machine-learning-what-is-a-good-ratio-between-features-and-samples" target="_blank">1 feature per 10 samples</a> is often recommended as the minimum for stable ML. There was no validation set, because you can't split 20 samples into training and testing sets. There was no independent cohort, so you can't see if the findings will generalize to another population. The impossibly high AUCs of 0.86-0.90 are meaningless: you could basically use random numbers and get these values.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there were exploratory correlations between self-report scores on the <a href="https://psychology-tools.com/test/meq-30" target="_blank">Mystical Experience Questionnaire</a> (MEQ) and the top 14 features per model, which I'll skip for now. <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[The MEQ is typically used to rate psychedelic experiences, not meditative experiences.

              <h4><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/21/exclusive-reviewer-recommended-against-publishing-paper-on-dna-in-covid-vaccines/">Exclusive: Reviewer recommended against publishing paper on DNA in COVID vaccines</a></h4>

              
                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.tandfonline.com/cms/asset/8c4a7f49-02e3-4bef-818b-b40dc245c73d/default_cover.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>


<p>Rolf Marschalek was on vacation when he saw a new paper had been published in the journal <em>Autoimmunity</em>. Marschalek, a biochemist at Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany, was “very upset,” he told Retraction Watch – because he’d peer-reviewed the manuscript and had recommended against publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the paper claimed to find DNA in mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines above regulators’ suggested amounts. The article appeared online September 6, and within weeks the publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/18/covid-vaccine-safety-acip-dna-contamination-study-autoimmunity/">began an investigation</a> into concerns about its content, as we reported previously.</p>



<p>In Marschalek’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Review-of-MS-Autoimmunity.pdf">initial review</a>, which he provided to us, he detailed how Qubit fluorometry, one of the methods the authors used to measure the amount of DNA in the vaccine vials, was “not suited” for use when samples contain much higher amounts of RNA than DNA, as is the case with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. He cited a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25003196?via%3Dihub">paper</a> he and colleagues had written about methods of quantifying amounts of RNA and DNA in mRNA vaccine vials, including Qubit.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133381"></span>



<p>The authors reported using the RNase A enzyme to break down RNA before measuring the amount of DNA, they wrote in the paper. According to Marschalek, the treatment time was too short to fully eliminate RNA in the samples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also singled out Figure 2 in the paper, which depicts the amount of DNA in a vaccine lot alongside the number of adverse events reported for each lot. The figure “clearly tells the reader that there is no correlation” between side effects and DNA content, Marschalek wrote in the review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors&nbsp; — David J. Speicher of the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada; independent researcher Jessica Rose, and Kevin McKernan of the Beverly, Mass.-based company Medicinal Genomics — submitted a revision, which Marschalek reviewed in July. “They didn’t change all the things I recommended,” he told us, and he wasn’t satisfied with the revisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thus, the revised version of the authors have strengthened my opinion that the whole paper is ‘a mission’ for the ‘anti-vaxx community’ and not a scientific paper,” he wrote in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Review-about-Submission-id-252538207.pdf">his review of the revision</a>. He again recommended against publication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only one other time in his career has Marschalek recommended rejecting a paper and seen it published, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He complained to the editor of <em>Autoimmunity</em>, who told him he could submit a letter to the editor, he said. He did so, but it was not published, because the journal does not publish letters to the editor, a representative of Taylor &amp; Francis, which publishes the journal, told him. However, the publisher <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/18/covid-vaccine-safety-acip-dna-contamination-study-autoimmunity/">began an investigation</a> of the article soon after. Scientific sleuth Kevin Patrick had also contacted the publisher with critiques of the article he had posted on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Letter_to_the_Editor_Autoimmunity.pdf">In his letter</a>, Marschalek summarized the critiques in his reviews and concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>If the scientific community does not collectively act to counter such pseudoscientific narratives, the proliferation of misinformation threatens to erode public trust and compromise the integrity of biomedical research.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Paolo Casali, editor in chief of <em>Autoimmunity</em>, confirmed Marschalek did review the paper. But initially he said he was “confused” by our request for comment on the decision to publish the paper. Marschalek “did not recommend rejection of the paper,” Casali said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the associate editor who handled the manuscript, Casali said, Marschalek recommended “major revision,” which the authors performed. The revised manuscript and authors’ letter “were deemed by the AE to have properly addressed the issues” raised by the original reviews, Casali said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative of Taylor &amp; Francis later got in touch with us and offered to provide a statement about “the current situation.” The statement provided on November 24 did not address our question about the review process. Because a “thorough investigation” including “additional independent expert assessment and review of associated editorial processes” is ongoing, “we cannot comment further about the article at this stage,” it said.</p>



<p>Rose, one of the authors of the paper, declined to discuss with us the methodological critiques in Marschalek’s reviews or letter to the editor. But she did question how we obtained the peer reviews, which she called “confidential documents.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She later <a href="https://jessicar.substack.com/p/dna-paper-retraction-update-we-received">posted on Substack</a> that our obtaining the reviews would be “a serious ethical breach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many journals now publish peer reviews online with articles, a practice which falls under the umbrella of “<a href="https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/">open peer review</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>McKernan wrote in a separate <a href="https://anandamide.substack.com/p/retraction-watch-steps-on-another">Substack post</a> the authors would prefer the peer review documents “were not confidential but according to the contract with Taylor and Francis, they are.” He also disputed Marschalek’s statement that the RNase A treatment wasn’t enough to get rid of all the RNA in the vaccine samples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McKernan acknowledged some of the vaccine lots with the most DNA did not have the most adverse events reported, but wrote, “nothing can be inferred from this as we don’t know the lot sizes,” which he said could vary by orders of magnitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/18/covid-vaccine-safety-acip-dna-contamination-study-autoimmunity/">we reported in September</a>, McKernan was also an author on <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202507.2155/v1">a preprint</a> about “synthetic mRNA vaccines and transcriptomic dysregulation” that was withdrawn following critiques from sleuths <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2025/07/25/preprint-claiming-that-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cause-transcriptomic-dysregulation-is-deeply-flawed/">Elisabeth Bik</a> and <a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/2025/07/28/no-mrna-vaccines-do-not-cause-transcriptomic-chaos/">Reese Richardson</a>. The <a href="https://www.f6publishing.com/ArticleInPressDetail/113869">manuscript now appears</a> as an “article in press” at the <em>World Journal of Experimental Medicine</em>. According to <a href="https://f6publishing.blob.core.windows.net/articlepdfpreview202511/113869.pdf">a PDF of the paper</a>, the peer reviewer’s report gave it a grade of C for quality and a grade of D for novelty, creativity and scientific significance.</p>



<p><em>Update, Nov. 24, 2025, 8:15 p.m. UTC: This story has been updated to include a statement from Taylor &amp; Francis.</em></p>

<p>The 2025 end-of-the-year holiday stretch will be temporarily impacting arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This temporary change only affects the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the arXiv team logs in from around the globe, our staff primarily takes time off according to the holiday schedule of the United States, which at the end of the year includes many holidays in quick succession, leading to several announcement delays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on </span><a href="http://arxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced by email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As our team rests, celebrates, and takes time to be with family, there will be some disruption to arXiv’s regular announcements, mailings, and user support.</span></p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of the delays around the following U.S. holidays and dates. Mailings and public availability of new submission will be deferred accordingly:</strong></p>
