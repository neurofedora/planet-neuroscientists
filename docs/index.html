              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geometry-architectural-problem-bee-wasp">How geometry solves architectural problems for bees and wasps</a></h4>

              
                <p>Honeybees and yellow jackets don’t look much like mathematicians — for one thing, they’re smaller. But collectively, the insects can solve a common architectural conundrum using a geometric solution that they evolved independently of each other.</p>



<p>As their colonies grow, these bees and wasps eventually need to increase the size of the hexagonal cells that make up their nests. But nest material is expensive, and it’s hard to efficiently combine hexagons of different sizes into a single continuous array. Both the honeybees and wasps have solved this problem <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by mixing in some pairs of five-sided and seven-sided cells</a>, which bridge the gap between different sizes of the six-sided hexagons, researchers report July 27 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>. This fix is close to the optimal solution to this problem, the team says.</p>





<p>“We’ve known for a long time that the hexagonal comb bees and wasps use is the most efficient, stable shape,” says Lewis Bartlett, a honeybee biologist at the University of Georgia in Athens who was not involved with the study. “But mixing different-sized hexagons is tricky.”</p>



<p>Social insect colonies, like those of honeybees and some wasps, are run by female workers who raise the offspring of their mother, the queen. They do this in hexagonal cells that honeybees build out of wax and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-glow-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescence">wasps construct from paper</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/21</em>). At a certain point in its life cycle, the colony needs to switch from raising workers to raising reproductives, like males and new queens. These reproductives are often bigger than the workers, which means the hexagonal cells need to get bigger too.</p>

<p>“Think of someone tiling your bathroom floor,” says Michael Smith, a biologist at Auburn University in Alabama. “If you have two different sizes of hexagons, and you&#8217;re going to group the small ones on one side and the big ones on the other side, you&#8217;re inherently going to have some kind of an issue when you try to fit them together.”</p>



<p>To figure out how bees and wasps solve this tiling puzzle, Smith and colleagues analyzed 115 images of colonies of five species of honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>, <em>A. cerana</em>, <em>A. dorsata</em>, <em>A. florea </em>and <em>A. andreniformis</em>), four species of <em>Vespula </em>wasp (<em>V. vulgaris</em>, <em>V. maculifrons</em>, <em>V. flavopilosa</em> and <em>V. shidai</em>), commonly known in North America as yellow jackets, and one species of paper wasp (<em>Metapolybia mesoamerica</em>). </p>



<p>Using an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2103605118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated image analysis tool</a> developed by team member Kirstin Petersen, a roboticist at Cornell University, the scientists extracted data from 22,745 cells such as lengths of cell walls and how many neighbors each cell has. (Smith also verified the data for each one of the cells by hand. “I was the unfortunate sap,” he says, “but I was also happy to do that.”)</p>



<p>The automated tool allowed the team to get data from irregular cells that aren’t perfect hexagons, which many scientists had ignored due to the difficulty of measuring them manually. These seemingly misshapen cells turned out to be anything but.</p>



<p>When transitioning from small worker cells to big reproductive cells, all the bees and wasps built pairs of adjoining five-sided and seven-sided cells to bridge the gap. A five-seven pairing has the same number of open sides as a pair of hexagons — both types of conjoined pairs have 10 sides available to connect to other cells — so it doesn’t disrupt the pattern. And the larger size of the seven-sided cell allows the bees and wasps to seamlessly start making larger hexagons on the other side of it. “They&#8217;re always building the five-sided cell first, and then the seven-sided cell,” Smith says.</p>



<p>Colleague Nils Napp, a computer scientist at Cornell University, designed a mathematical model of this strategy and found that what the bees and wasps are doing is close to the optimal geometric solution.</p>



<p>The most efficient way to build an array of shapes such that each cell is big enough to raise a baby bee or wasp can be represented by a Delaunay triangulation. Imagine a sheet of paper marked with dozens of dots. Then, fill the sheet with triangles by connecting only neighboring dots. Finally, around each triangle, draw a circle that touches each corner. In the layout of a Delaunay triangulation, no dot is inside any of those circles. Drawing additional lines that connect centers of neighboring circles produces a tiling of polygons, much like the latticework of hexagons found in the bee and wasp nests.</p>

<p>Napp’s model shows that adding bigger hexagons to the nest slowly inches the whole array away from perfection, such that gaps may form or the workers may need to build an unusable cell to keep the nest together. The optimal thing to do is to add a five-seven pair just as the Delaunay condition is about to be violated. Across the bee and wasp species, about 85 percent of all nonhexagonal cells are in five-seven pairs, just like the model predicts.</p>



<p>The bees and wasps used in this study are separated by 179 million years of evolution and build their nests out of different materials. “But both evolved to use this five-seven rule for transitioning between hexagon sizes,” Bartlett says. “Evolution has a tendency to solve challenges optimally.”</p>

<p><em>Science</em> has rescinded an expression of concern it issued one month ago after the authors provided data that “addressed concerns about the integrity of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal had published the expression of concern for the 2021 article “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abh2890">Light-induced mobile factors from shoots regulate rhizobium-triggered soybean root nodulation</a>” after two separate readers contacted the editorial team about an issue in the paper, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/29/science-paper-marked-with-expression-of-concern-after-readers-pointed-out-data-issue/">we reported</a> at the time. The expression of concern noted that &#8220;that data presented in Fig. 5 assessed GmNSP1 expression rather than GmNIN expression.&#8221;</p>



<p>The article has been cited 43 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is publishing the newly submitted data as a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj7468">correction</a>, as well as an <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj7040">editor’s note</a> explaining the removal of the expression of concern. The new notice states: </p>



<span id="more-127605"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These changes have addressed concerns about the integrity of the paper. Therefore, <em>Science</em> has removed the Editorial Expression of Concern and posted this notification in its place to indicate the editors’ confidence in the Research Article’s data and conclusions. We thank the community for bringing these issues to our attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corrected version of the paper now includes GmNIN expression data in figure 5, and updates to the supplementary materials.</p>



<p>Neither of the two corresponding authors of the article, Shiyong Sun and Xuelu Wang of the State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Adaptation and Improvement at Henan University in Kaifeng, China, have responded to our request for comment. </p>



<p>Last week, <em>Science Advances </em>published an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj8941">expression of concern</a> after the authors of the article “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg3758">Unemployment and underemployment are causes of suicide</a>” notified the journal “of a quantitative error in their reporting of summary statistics” that they said did not affect their results or overall conclusions. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors regret this error and apologize to the community. <em>Science Advances</em> is examining the details of this issue and will proceed with a response as soon as sufficient information has been obtained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response from <em>Science</em> and its sister journal in these cases stands in stark contrast to the flagship publication’s failure to publish corrections to two of Marc Tessier-Lavigne’s articles that the neuroscientist and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/19/marc-tessier-lavigne-stanford-president-resignation/">former president of Stanford University</a> had submitted in 2015. “We regret this error,” Holden Thorp, editor in chief of <em>Science</em>, said in a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/stanford-investigates-potential-misconduct-president-s-research">statement</a> to the journal’s editorially independent news division.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A journal spokesperson told us: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Science</em> has been consistently more aggressive about correcting the record, where needed, in recent years. We take related matters very seriously and communicate such updates to reporters via the embargoed <em>Science</em> Press Package, to readers in our print and online issues, and via social media, to spread the word as widely as possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference</a> (fast forward to minute 31 to begin watching). This is the final blog in a series of posts on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-takes-people-willing-to-disrupt-the-system-to-move-it-forward/">part two</a>, I highlighted how shifting to Open Science practices can have meaningful and long-lasting impact. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/moving-beyond-the-apc-to-make-scholarly-publishing-more-equitable/">part three</a>, I discussed how institutional business models can also affect equitable change at scale.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>So where do we go from here? What&rsquo;s required of publishers to accelerate the transition to Open Science and change the landscape for the good of all of us?</p>



<p>Back in the early days of the pandemic&ndash; which now feels like a lifetime ago &ndash; I remember being deeply moved by Arundhati Roy&rsquo;s piece <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca">The Pandemic is a Portal</a> about the impact of the pandemic in India. Towards the end, she notes that &ldquo;&hellip;in the midst of this terrible despair, [this moment] offers us a chance to rethink the doomsday machine we have built for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>



<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that this same imperative applies to scientific publishing. I don&rsquo;t think that evolutionary change will get us to where we need to be fast enough. At the STM Conference in Frankfurt last October, even a panel of CEOs from the biggest publishers agreed that scholarly publishing hadn&rsquo;t changed that much.</p>



<p>While I&rsquo;m enormously proud of what PLOS has achieved in its first 23 years, our role is fundamentally that of a catalyst and so we&rsquo;re nowhere near done.</p>



<p>To inform our next leap forward, we&rsquo;ve been in deep conversation over recent months with four key groups: researchers, senior university administrators, librarians, and funders. While we&rsquo;ve heard support for much work done by publishers, we&rsquo;vealso heard convergence on what&rsquo;s failing and frustration at the lack of disruption.</p>



<p>One of our roles has always been to demonstrate what&rsquo;s possible and so that&rsquo;s again where our focus is now shifting. We have a vision for a radical reframing of research sharing, built on the principles of Open Science, based on rigor, openness, and equity.</p>



<p>That vision is something we&rsquo;re now making concrete as we create a new way of sharing research. This will shift us away from the final article being the sole center of attention to one of a series of research objects, shared and appropriately assessed at different points in the research lifecycle. One that demonstrates that the article doesn&rsquo;t have to be immutable but that conclusions may shift over time. And one in which peer review evolves into less of a binary accept/reject decision to a more nuanced assessment.</p>



<p>There are a growing number of other innovators alongside us. But not enough. Our industry must embrace more radical change and let go of its own distorting incentives, those of profits and prestige.</p>



<p><strong>Call to Action</strong></p>



<p>And so as with all good experiments, the one we&rsquo;ve lived these past few years will only be useful if we learn something and change as a result. We&rsquo;ve all seen what&rsquo;s possible. And we know what&rsquo;s at stake. Now is the time to capitalize on this progress, to deepen interconnection, to align infrastructure and policies. We know that Open Science is the most effective way to tackle our common global challenges.</p>



<p>And so, I&rsquo;d like to leave you with a question: as a publisher, funder, scientist, or policymaker, what steps can you each take to move us forward?</p>



<p>Publishers have both an opportunity and a responsibility to act now, but we all share that responsibility. Everyone is this ecosystem is a crucial partner in the ambitions that I&rsquo;ve outlined in this series of blogs posts. If each of us is willing to take one disruptive step, we can ensure the pandemic&rsquo;s legacy is a reminder not just of what science can do, but also of how science should be done.</p>

<p>The journal <em>BMC Public Health</em> plans to retract an article that found smoking rates fell faster than expected in the US as use of e-cigarettes increased, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The authors contend that they addressed the issues cited in the retraction notice during the peer review process and say they addressed them even more extensively when the journal said they intended to retract.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z">Population-level counterfactual trend modelling to examine the relationship between smoking prevalence and e-cigarette use among US adults</a>,” was published last October. The authors are all employees of Pinney Associates, a consulting firm that they disclosed “provide[s] consulting services on tobacco harm reduction on an exclusive basis to Juul Labs Inc.” The article also disclosed that Juul Labs funded the research and reviewed and provided comments on a draft manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some journals, including several in the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5193">BMJ family</a> and the <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306916">American Journal of Public Health</a>, will not publish research funded by the tobacco industry, which has led to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/30/bmj-journal-retracts-e-cigarette-paper-after-authors-disclose-tobacco-industry-funding-late-in-the-process/">at least one retraction</a>. But the planned BMC Public Health retraction notice does not refer to that conflict of interest.</p>



<span id="more-127608"></span>



<p>An unpublished letter to the editor prompted the investigation that led to the journal’s retraction decision, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. The letter did not request retraction of the paper, but argued that its analyses “were flawed and therefore potentially produced misleading findings that would benefit tobacco industry profits and interests.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorena Verduci, an editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, shared the letter with the authors on May 24. She also included an assessment of the letter by an unnamed editorial board member who agreed with the critiques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among other critiques, the letter called out Juul’s support for the article, and that the analysis assumed the prevalence of e-cigarette use in the US was zero in 2010 and rose in a linear fashion until a CDC survey began gathering data on usage in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors’ filling in linear data points between 2010 and 2014 for their main analysis was “questionable,” the letter stated, and findings from an additional analysis that left out those filled-in values “are hidden in the manuscript.” Reading the paper’s supplementary materials, the letter said, revealed that “most estimated associations were no longer statistically significant” in that analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Floe Foxon, the original article’s corresponding author, sent the authors’ response on June 12.&nbsp;In their response, the authors highlight sensitivity tests they performed using 2009 and 2011 as alternative cutoff years, which they said “support the findings of the main analysis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper’s <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z/peer-review">peer review record</a>, which is available online, indicates that the authors added those sensitivity tests in a <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12889-022-14341-z/12889_2022_14341_AuthorComment_V3.pdf">revision</a> responding to reviewer feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also wrote that the analysis leaving out the filled-in data:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>showed that the results of our main analyses were robust for the younger adult and male cohorts in these sensitivity tests. These are the cohorts with the highest e-cigarette use prevalence, and thus the most relevant to the research question. Contrary to the Letter, which claims that our results were not mentioned in text, the findings from this analysis are reported in the Results section of our manuscript under the subheading ‘Sensitivity test results.’ Thus, the allegation in the Letter that we “directed attention elsewhere” is simply untrue.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verduci, who has not responded to multiple requests for comment over the past week, informed Foxon on July 18 that the journal had decided to retract the article in light of the editorial board member’s assessment of the authors’ response. She included the assessment, which did not explicitly recommend retraction. However, the editorial board member wrote: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am not convinced that the authors’ response addresses the main issues and serious flaws raised by the authors of the Letter.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verduci proposed the following text for the retraction notice, and asked the authors if they agreed with it, giving them a deadline of July 25 to respond: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors have retracted this article after readers have raised concerns around the methodology. In particular, the paper&#8217;s conclusions are based on assumption of ‘0’ prevalence of e-cigarette use in 2010 which contradicts available data. Without this assumption, the results become non-significant.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Foxon replied on July 21 that the authors “object strenuously to the intention to retract our article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reply included additional analyses using 2006, 2007, and 2008 as cutoff years when e-cigarette use was zero in the US, and offered to add them to the paper. The authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The fundamental finding remains: smoking is declining at a faster-than-expected rate, in a manner that correlates with the rise in e-cigarette prevalence. In fact, the correlation coefficients change little with these variations in cut-off years, which suggests that the findings are robust.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Foxon told us the email informing the authors of the retraction was “baffling.” He maintained that the authors had “thoroughly addressed” the criticisms, and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It was not previously indicated that a retraction was on the table; the previous correspondence we received from the journal did not contain any accusation of fabrication, falsification, or anything else in the COPE guidelines that would warrant a retraction. We were asked to respond to concerns raised by an anonymous reader and an anonymous Editorial Board Member, but at that time there was no mention of an investigation into a retraction; we were never notified that such an investigation was taking place.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked what Foxon thought should happen instead of a retraction. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am a firm believer in open science, and that path would entail publishing both sides of the disagreement: the anonymous Letter to the Editor and the anonymous Editorial Board Member’s opinions, as well as our responses. That would allow interested readers to decide for themselves which conclusion best fits the available data. Retracting the paper does not afford readers this opportunity, and credits one side of a discussion while suppressing the other in a way that is incongruous with the pursuit of scientific knowledge. Readers may welcome seeing an analysis which the anonymous Letter-writer and Editorial Board Member believe is more correct. NHIS is a publicly-available dataset, and they have the same access to these data as we did.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-saddle-horseback-riding-china-grave">The oldest known horseback riding saddle was found in a grave in China</a></h4>

              
                <p>A woman buried more than 2,400 years ago in what’s now northwestern China has galloped into a scientific afterlife atop the earliest directly dated horseback riding saddle.</p>



<p>Researchers have radiocarbon dated the well-preserved, soft saddle to 727 B.C. to 396 B.C. Excavated at what’s known as the Yanghai cemetery, this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ara.2023.100451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertly crafted piece of riding equipment</a> is about as old as, or possibly older than, the previous record holders, archaeologist Patrick Wertmann of the University of Zurich and colleagues report in the September <em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>.</p>





<p>Soft saddles found in tombs of mobile herders and warriors from the Scythian Pazyryk culture of northern Asia date to 430 B.C. to 420 B.C. Those dates are inferred from analyses of tree rings in wood that was used to construct those chambers.</p>



<p>Despite its simple design, “the Yanghai saddle was manufactured by a specialist familiar not only with needle- and leatherwork but with horse riding and the anatomy of horse and rider,” Wertmann says. The finished product, which showed signs of extensive use, had been placed with the deceased woman’s body in a position for her to take another ride.</p>



<p>It shares basic features with present-day soft saddles, including two wing-shaped hides sewn together to form a seat, divided by a long, narrow strip of hide that was placed over a horse’s spine. Rounded pieces of hide attached to the front and back of the wing-shaped pieces would have helped riders to maintain an upright position and raise themselves up, say when shooting an arrow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="494" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072423_BB_exhumed-saddle_inline.jpg" alt="A shallow grave with a skeleton, around which is an ancient saddle (which is circled for greater visibility)" class="wp-image-3129925" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072423_BB_exhumed-saddle_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072423_BB_exhumed-saddle_inline-527x383.jpg 527w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072423_BB_exhumed-saddle_inline-619x450.jpg 619w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072423_BB_exhumed-saddle_inline-256x186.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129925">A more than 2,400-year-old saddle found in western China showed signs of extensive use and had been placed with a deceased woman’s body in a way that suggests she might be riding still (marked by the red circle).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129925">P. Wertmann <em>et al</em>/<em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>, 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Different stitching techniques using either sinew or leather thread hold the Yanghai saddle together. Saddle stitching, a method still practiced today that creates two rows of interlocking threads using a single row of holes, connected front and back supports to the saddle seat. Simpler stitching methods were used to repair tears in the saddle and to close incisions in each main hide that could be opened to stuff animal hair and straw into the saddle seat for cushioning.</p>



<p>When and where people began to ride horses and use saddles remains uncertain. Yamnaya herders living in the area of modern Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-worlds-earliest-horseback-riders">may have ridden horseback as early as around 5,000 years ago</a>,&nbsp;based on an analysis of the herders’ skeletal features (<em>SN: 3/3/23</em>). Ancient artwork from around 4,800 years ago in Mesopotamia shows horses being ridden without saddles, Wertmann says.</p>



<p>But only saddles provide clear evidence of horseback riding, says anthropological archaeologist Alicia Ventresca-Miller of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Subtle construction differences between the Yanghai saddle and others found at several regional sites, presumed to be of around the same age as the Yanghai find, “suggest that knowledge of saddle-making was being transferred between [communities] that then made variable types of saddles,” says Ventresca-Miller, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>At Yanghai, where 531 tombs have been excavated, researchers have recovered whips, bridles and other items associated with horseback riding that date to as early as around 3,300 years ago. Only one other grave aside from the woman’s tomb, thought to be of about the same age, has yielded a saddle. But that find is fragmentary and has not been radiocarbon dated.</p>



<p>Yanghai excavations have also produced the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pants-oldest-ancient-horseman-asia-culture-origin">oldest known pair of pants</a>, worn by a horseback rider around 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 2/18/22</em>).</p>



<p>Saddle-making emerged later, as riders became concerned with their own comfort and safety and the health of their horses, Wertmann suspects. Comfortable saddles would have enabled everyone in a community to ride horses and spurred increases in long-distance horseback trips, Ventresca-Miller says.</p>





<p>Wertmann’s team cannot say whether Yanghai people, who lived in year-round settlements, or a mounted herding community from elsewhere in Central and East Asia made the ancient woman’s saddle. She may have migrated to Yanghai from a herding group and brought the saddle along. Or Yanghai people may have acquired the saddle through trade. Or local experts in leather and needlework may have crafted the saddle.</p>

<p>An alumna of the lab of <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/?s=carlo+croce">Carlo Croce</a>, a high-profile cancer researcher at The Ohio State University with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCroce%252c%2bCarlo%2bM">14 retractions</a>, has sued the institution over the results of its investigation that found she committed research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flavia Pichiorri is now a principal investigator with <a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research/beckman-research-institute/hematologic-malignancies-translational-science/pichiorri-lab">her own lab</a> researching potential therapies for multiple myeloma at City of Hope – a cancer center that also owns Cancer Treatment Centers of America –&nbsp; in Duarte, Calif.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She worked at Ohio State from 2004-16, first as a postdoctoral researcher in Croce’s lab, then as a research scientist, and finally as an assistant professor of hematology. She has been a PI on grants that garnered <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/UElPzu9dME-YG2jg4sv2EA/projects?PI=10290216">millions of dollars</a> in funding from the National Institutes of Health since switching jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127597"></span>



<p>After Pichiorri left Ohio State, the university received allegations that some of her work contained fake data in the form of manipulated and reused images. A subsequent investigation, finalized in 2020, found that Pichiorri was responsible for the faked data in four publications, one of which was a correction, spanning from her time in Croce’s lab through her establishing her own lab at Ohio State. <em>Nature</em> reported the university’s findings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02002-5">last year</a>, calling them one of “the first determinations of research misconduct relating to work done in Croce’s lab.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Pichiorri is suing her former employer, alleging in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pichiorri-complaint.pdf">her complaint</a> that the investigation was “flawed,” the findings “invalid,” and the issues identified in her work the result of “honest error.” She further alleges that the university’s investigation and requests that journals retract her papers with fake data violated her rights to due process, and that the publication of the final report defamed her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Croce has filed several lawsuits unsuccessfully, and now owes his attorneys <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/judge-orders-cancer-researchers-art-collection-seized-to-pay-fees-from-failed-libel-suit/">well over $1 million</a>.</p>



<p>Among Pichiorri’s demands: that Ohio State retract its investigation report, no longer keep it on file, and revise its findings to be “consistent with federal research misconduct standards and evidence presented by Plaintiff.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Ohio State told us the university “cannot comment on pending litigation.” Ohio State&nbsp; in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OSU-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">court filing</a> asking for the suit to be dismissed with prejudice has disputed Pichiorri’s allegations and argued that federal regulation of research misconduct investigations preempts her claims.</p>



<p>Pichiorri declined to be interviewed and referred questions to her lawyers. We asked the lawyers, Renny J. Tyson and William W. Patmon III, both of Columbus, Ohio, to comment on the university’s arguments in its motion to dismiss the case. Tyson responded that Pichiorri “stands by the allegations in her complaint.”</p>



<p>Pichiorri’s suit names each member of the university’s “College of Medicine Investigation Committee” – officially referred to as “COMIC” – as well as the Ohio State Board of Trustees and the university’s Vice President of Research. She claims the members of the investigation committee “lacked the requisite expertise to review and evaluate research misconduct investigations,” and that Ohio State’s “failure to properly select, train and provide sufficient oversight” to the committee “resulted in a flawed investigation.”</p>



<p>The findings, the suit alleges, were “premised upon improper standards of review; and unevenly applied to Dr. Pichiorri, especially with respect to male researchers.”</p>



<p>The complaint elaborates:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Carlo Croce was the principal senior lead researcher overseeing all the findings in which image falsifications were found and no research misconduct finding was made against him, even though all the work was produced in the OSU laboratory controlled by him and Plaintiff and other PhD students and post-doctoral researchers were supervised by him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pichiorri further describes the conditions in Croce’s lab:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Pichiorri and other OSU researchers at the time were not trained, were left unsupervised, without computers connected to OSU servers or standard of procedures to save or record the data, required to work long days and nights under strenuous conditions and treated as cheap labor to perform the bottom rung work related to the manuscripts in order that OSU and Dr. Croce, the party primarily responsible for the research, could continue to receive grants and grant monies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the problems in Dr. Croce&#8217;s laboratory, of which OSU and the COMIC were aware, the COMIC ignored those problems and assigned fault for the laboratory failings to Dr. Pichiorri.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In her complaint, Pichiorri maintains she “followed all procedures, protocols and standards of practice with regard to her work.” Other co-authors were responsible for the data and figures in question, she alleges, and “there was no evidence she was not diligent as a co-author.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast, the investigation committee’s report, <a href="https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-022-02002-5/23294232">published by <em>Nature</em></a>, had concluded that responsibility for the integrity of the images “should lie with the individual assembling the figures, which by her own admissions, is Dr. Pichiorri.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the course of the investigation, Pichiorri submitted what she said were original data from the experiments that formed the basis for the figures. The committee, she alleges, should have viewed this data and the formal corrections she had already made to some figures in the published papers “as evidence of honest error.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pichiorri also claims the number of questionable figures – eight, four of which were corrected before the investigation began – indicates the irregularities were the result of honest error. Her complaint states that the U.S. Office of Research Integrity, which oversees research misconduct investigations:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>has historically determined that research misconduct accusations are typically the result of honest error where, as in the instant case, only a few images and data are involved. Where ORI has found research misconduct, it has only found actual research misconduct in cases where the mean number of falsified or fabricated data involved an average sixty-two (62) images within a range of minimum twelve (12) to one hundred eighty-nine (189) images.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In its review of the data and explanations Pichiorri submitted, the investigation committee concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>none of Dr. Pichiorri&#8217;s current arguments justify how an image would be altered by stretching, flipping or inverting.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pichiorri alleges that her “career and professional reputation have suffered irreparable, grave injury” because Ohio State’s “improper and errant findings of misconduct and the publication of such erroneous findings that have placed Dr. Pichiorri in a false light and irreparably damaged her reputation in the scientific community.”</p>



<p>She claims in her complaint that after <em>Nature</em>’s story publicized Ohio State’s finding, she was removed from an NIH panel she had served on for seven years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also alleges that Ohio State contacted City of Hope with its findings and requested the cancer center investigate all of her NIH-funded work. The second investigation found she had “not engaged in any research misconduct,” according to the complaint, “but the damage was already done.” Pichiorri was left feeling “diminished in her role as a senior leader,” and a member of her staff “allegedly resigned due to the accusations.”</p>



<p>The Ohio State investigation committee recommended that two of Pichiorri’s papers should be retracted and another corrected. Of the two articles recommended for retraction, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610822004974">one</a> has been pulled and the other marked with an <a href="https://rupress.org/jem/article/219/11/e2012095009272022e/213516/Expression-of-Concern-In-vivo-NCL-targeting">expression of concern</a>. The <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/5290/text/">article</a> the committee wanted corrected does not appear to have been updated. Two other papers on which Pichiorri was a co-author have been <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dFlavia%2bPichiorri">retracted</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sport-supplements-ingredients-dietary">Many sports supplements have no trace of their key ingredients</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fat incinerator. Metabolism booster. Thermo activator. Some over-the-counter sports supplements advertise ingredients with purported performance-enhancing properties, but it’s anyone’s guess what’s really in that pill or powder.</p>



<p>Just <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 percent of nearly 60 tested dietary supplements</a> actually contain an accurate amount of key ingredients listed on the label, scientists report July 17 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>. Forty percent did not contain a detectable amount of the ingredients at all.</p>



<p>“I just had to shake my head,” says Pieter Cohen, a primary care doctor at Cambridge Health Alliance in Somerville, Mass. “It’s incredible that in 40 percent of the products, the manufacturer doesn’t even bother putting any [of the ingredient] in.”</p>





<p>Cohen and his colleagues chemically analyzed 57 sports supplements with labels that listed <em>R. vomitoria</em>, methylliberine, halostachine, octopamine or turkesterone — plants or plant compounds that could potentially serve as stimulants or muscle-builders. Only 34 contained the ingredient claimed. Six had about the right amount; 28 had inaccurate amounts that varied wildly, from 0.02 percent to 334 percent of the quantity indicated on the label.</p>



<p>“That’s alarming,” says Luis Rustveld, a dietician and epidemiologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who was not involved with the work. Some people may be very sensitive to these ingredients he says, and “they may be getting a whole lot more than they thought.”</p>



<p>Cohen’s team also found that seven of the products tested contained at least one compound prohibited by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In past years, scientists have identified hundreds of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hundreds-dietary-supplements-tainted-potentially-harmful-drugs">supplements tainted with potentially harmful drugs</a> <em>(SN: 10/12/18).</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike prescribed drugs, the FDA does not have the authority to approve dietary supplements before they hit grocery store shelves. But the agency requires that supplements do at least contain the ingredients they list on their label, Cohen says.</p>



<p>Just because a supplement is on the market does not mean it’s safe, effective or contains what it advertises, says Patricia Deuster, a nutrition specialist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md., who did not participate in the new research. “It is virtually impossible for the average person … to make informed decisions about purchasing supplements without outside assistance.”</p>



<p>Third-party organizations like NSF, BSCG and USP can be helpful, she says, because they analyze supplements and offer their stamp of approval. And an <a href="https://www.opss.org/opss-scorecard-check-your-dietary-supplement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online scorecard</a> developed by the U.S. Department of Defense can also help consumers evaluate their supplements, Deuster says.</p>



<p>When deciding what and whether to buy, Cohen cautions, “you should use the utmost skepticism.” Rustveld agrees. “Whenever you see claims like, ‘You’re going to burn fat’, or ‘You’re going to improve your performance,’” he says, “if it sounds too good to be true, it’s probably not true.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-intense-sunlight-earth-atacama-desert">The most intense sunlight on Earth can be found in the Atacama Desert</a></h4>

              
                <p>Forget Arizona or Florida — sun worshippers ought to head to the Atacama Desert in South America. It&#8217;s there that <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/104/6/BAMS-D-22-0215.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sun&#8217;s rays on Earth are most intense</a>, beating out places like Mount Everest and even, occasionally, rivaling the conditions on Venus, researchers report July 3 in the <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</em>.</p>



<p>Satellite data have suggested that the Altiplano — a high-altitude plateau in the Atacama that straddles parts of Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Argentina — experiences the most intense levels of sunlight on Earth. But since satellites look down on our planet’s surface from afar, it’s important to verify that claim with on-the-ground data, says Raúl Cordero, a physicist at the University of Santiago in Chile. “How good are these estimates?”</p>



<p>To answer that question, Cordero and colleagues set up a small atmospheric observatory, housed in two shipping containers, in the Chilean Altiplano. Since 2016, the researchers have been measuring solar radiation levels at the site using a pyranometer, a palm-sized instrument sensitive to ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared light.</p>

<p>Based on the first five years of data from the observatory, the average amount of solar power hitting each square meter of the landscape — 308 watts — is consistent with the earlier satellite observations and even higher than values <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/101/11/bamsD190198.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded by a pyranometer near the summit of Mount Everest</a>, the team reports.</p>



<p>The researchers also captured bursts of extremely intense solar radiation. One event, in January 2017, blasted the site with 2,177 watts per square meter — more than seven times the average. The intensity of that burst and others like it rivals <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-will-it-take-go-venus">solar radiation on Venus</a>, which is over 40 million kilometers closer to the sun than Earth is (<em>SN: 2/13/18</em>). Such events, which typically last just a few minutes, are caused by thin clouds scattering light toward the ground, the researchers suggest.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-driver-ants-africa-ecology">Some African birds follow nomadic ants to their next meal</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>COIMBATORE, India</strong> — To better understand Equatorial Guinea’s tropical birds, ornithologists Luke L. Powell and Patricia Rodrigues scan the ground rather than the trees. They are searching for nests of driver ants (<em>Dorylus</em> spp.). These voracious predators will march out of their underground nests and fan out into a meters-wide swarm, flushing out insects and worms from undergrowth. From the trees, birds swoop down to catch the fleeing insects. And where the ant swarms go, the birds follow.</p>



<p>Swarms make humming and “tick tick tick” sounds, says Powell, of the University of Porto in Portugal. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-ants-squeak">It is the sound of the ants</a> — and of animals scurrying in panic (<em>SN: 8/12/02</em>). “Then you hear the sounds of birds chirping at the edge [of the swarm], communicating.”</p>





<p>Ant-following birds are well studied in the neotropical Americas. In Africa, however, “people have seen birds follow ants, but nobody has really looked” to see whether the animals have a specialized relationship, says Rodrigues from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.</p>



<p>The first step to figuring that out is finding driver ant nests. Since 2020, Rodrigues has spent weeks at a time scrutinizing the ground for ants in a forest near Ciudad de la Paz. When she finds them, she knows to keep her distance. “They’re super-duper aggressive and they have giant mandibles that can pierce your skin,” Rodrigues says. Despite her caution, ant bites “inevitably happen”— sometimes the ants fall out of trees onto her and her colleagues.</p>



<p>Rodrigues follows the ants as they carry food back to their nests. Since driver ants are nomadic, often relocating their colonies, she checks every nest daily in case the colony starts to move. “We do a lot of walking around the block,” she says with a laugh.</p>



<p>For their latest study, Rodrigues, Powell and colleagues placed cameras at the entrances of seven&nbsp;driver ant nests and recorded about 80 hours of footage. “Birds come up to a nest entrance and check it out,” says Powell, leaning his body forward and turning his head left and right, imitating a bird, “and fly into the direction of where the ants are raiding that day.”</p>

Rodrigues</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When the team played calls of ant-following birds like the white-tailed ant thrush (<em>Neocossyphus poensis</em>) and fire-crested alethe (<em>Alethe castanea</em>), it attracted about 30 other bird species. Many of these birds eat insects and could be homing in on the calls of specialized ant-following birds for food, the researchers say.&nbsp; In contrast, only seven bird species responded to calls of the African green pigeon (<em>Treron calvus</em>), which does not follow ants.</p>



<p>What’s more, early results from a GPS monitoring experiment suggest that <a href="https://www.xcdsystem.com/atbc/program/PlxWxeL/index.cfm?pgid=2748&amp;sid=23991&amp;abid=121645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ant-following birds have larger home ranges</a> than the average understory bird. The scientists think this is because the birds have to fly farther to survey the moving ant colonies, Powell said July 6 at a meeting of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.</p>



<p>These newly documented behaviors in African tropical birds show they are more specialized on driver ants than researchers had expected, Rodrigues says. The team now wants to examine how this specialization affects the birds when forest degradation changes the numbers and distribution of driver ants. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous studies in <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cameroon</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.13014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equatorial Guinea</a> have shown that forest degradation drastically reduces the populations of insectivorous birds, especially the ones that follow ants. Because driver ants avoid hot, open spaces, Powell and Rodrigues wonder if that might explain why these birds are particularly vulnerable to forest loss.</p>



<p>The team’s work “is essential to inform decision makers and ideally have an impact on regulations for deforestation and land-use change in countries with growing agriculture, such as Equatorial Guinea,” says Carolina Ocampo-Ariza, an ecologist at the University of Göttingen in Germany who has reported on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S143917911830272X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact of forest loss on ant-following birds in Cameroon</a>. Forest degradation would remove the mix of trees and shrubs that the birds need to “stand on and effectively catch prey and follow the ants,” she says.</p>





<p>Because ant-following birds are relatively easy to find, not hunted, and sensitive to forest disturbance, Powell says they could indicate which forests to protect and how. Studying the birds and their relationship with driver ants is akin to “keeping your finger on the pulse of forest health,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-heat-wave-summer">Here’s how much climate change increases the odds of brutally hot summers</a></h4>

              
                <p>The recent, record-breaking heat waves that have scorched the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, China and southern Europe were made <a href="https://doi.org/10.25561/105549" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatically more likely</a> due to human-caused climate change, researchers report July 25 in a study from the World Weather Attribution network.</p>



<p>“This is absolutely not a surprise,” climate scientist Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said at a July 24 news briefing. But “while the weather is changing as expected, how much it hurts us is larger than expected.”</p>





<p>These intense and at times deadly heat waves are occurring as high-pressure systems stall across the Northern Hemisphere, creating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">barely budging heat domes</a> (<em>SN: 7/19/23</em>). &nbsp;Phoenix, for example, has reached at least 43.3° C (110° Fahrenheit) every day for more than three weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Otto and her colleagues used computers to simulate Earth’s climate, with and without human-caused climate change, to assess how likely the recent heat waves would have been under different climate conditions.</p>



<p>In a world without climate change, they found, the recent extreme heat in China would be expected roughly once every 250 years. Now, it’s a once-in-five-years phenomenon, or 50 times more likely to occur. Meanwhile the extreme heat waves in southern Europe and North America, which would have been virtually impossible without climate change, are now likely to occur once every 10 years and 15 years, respectively.</p>



<p>Should climate warming reach 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, these events could occur every two to five years, the simulations showed. We’ve already warmed by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-weather-climate-change-2022">at least 1.1 degrees C</a> since then (<em>SN: 12/22/22</em>).</p>



<p>Though it’s still too early to pin down the human toll of these extreme events, hundreds of deaths have already been reported from regions around the world, and power shortage concerns grow as the demand for cooling surges.</p>



<p>“The risks are rising faster than we are adapting,” Otto said. “We are much more vulnerable than we might have liked to believe in the past.”</p>

<p>Hyperprolific authors have been drawing attention for some time. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/09/12/when-it-comes-to-authorship-how-prolific-is-too-prolific/">In 2018</a>, for example, a <em>Nature</em> article reported that “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06185-8">thousands of scientists have published a paper every five days</a>.” And earlier this year <em>El Pais</em> noted that a now-suspended scientist <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-04-02/one-of-the-worlds-most-cited-scientists-rafael-luque-suspended-without-pay-for-13-years.html">was publishing a paper every 37 hours</a>.</p>



<p>What about an author who publishes more than once a day, on average?</p>



<p>Viroj Wiwanitkit has published <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Wiwanitkit%20V&amp;filter=datesearch.y_1">543 items indexed in PubMed</a> in the last 12 months, the vast majority of them letters to the editor. Most of Wiwanitkit’s letters with colleagues appear to be only a single paragraph. Many concern <a href="http://dx.doi.org/0.1016/j.wneu.2022.12.059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 and vaccinations</a>, but the catalog includes letters about <a href="http://dx.doi.org/0.1007/5584_2022_741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monkeypox</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00590-021-03193-9">knee replacement surgery</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17712/nsj.2023.1.20220122">bipolar disorder</a>, even <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2023-003864">ChatGPT</a>.</p>



<span id="more-127585"></span>



<p>To be clear, most definitions of hyperprolific authors exclude such work. But the volume seemed noteworthy. We asked Wiwanitkit, now an adjunct professor at Joseph Ayobabalola University in Nigeria, some questions over the course of several emails. Below is an edited version; we have made the entire exchange available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wiwanitkit-interview.pdf">here</a>. We have not made spelling or grammatical changes anywhere in either version. (And a researcher who flagged a May 2020 correction of a paper by Wiwanitkit reminds us of a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/22/what-it-takes-to-correct-the-record-autopsy-of-a-covid-19-corrigendum/">guest post he wrote for us about the episode</a>.)</p>



<p><strong>How do you explain your productivity?</strong></p>



<p>For the profilic work, I have collaboration with several other profilic authors and I take role in supervision in most cases. The type of article that our group work is usually on scientific letter to editor, which is a standard type of article in scientific journal. Our group focus to work and publish only in a standard non predatory (non-paid) journal with international indexing. For sure, the article has to pas the scientific peer review and checking for code of conduct by the academic publisher.</p>



<p>A way to produce the scientific work has to start with a good ideas, plan and work on the academic plan. As I am also journal editor for many journals, therefore, I usually get communicate by some academic practitioner for collaboration.</p>



<p>You are not the first one who ask how to produce many publications and I reply a simple concept that you have to create, idea, make a plan and practice to get experience that you can have experience in working and writing. Also, I usually teach my junior to follow the code of conduct and it is an important that if you do not follow the good code of conduct , you will not gain your own creative ideas and experience to do any work</p>



<p>I have work for more than 30 years, starting from a poor developing countries. At early stage, I wrote many article sand rejected (more than one thousand draft article that I submit during my early academic practice and was rejected).</p>



<p>If you have loss an attempt, you will not get to the target. Experience and succcess will be soon if you still walk. Without walking , you cannot reach the target. I take 4 hours every day for working and writing. Though there might be a lot of work, I use the time in the night to work. That&#8217;s all.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you focus on indexed journals?</strong></p>



<p>Indexed journal is a standard journal platform in academic society.</p>



<p>Gray journal and predatory journal is not good. I think you understand.</p>



<p><strong>Do you benefit financially or otherwise from publishing these letters?</strong></p>



<p>I have never receive any money from writing those works.</p>



<p>Academic work is by willingness. I also have ever advice some of my junior who try to make money from working in incorrect way such as ghost writing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Are you concerned that this volume of work leads to superficial letters?</strong></p>



<p>Superficial or not depends on the view of readers. Any work go on routine academic peer reviewing process and ethical code of conduct.</p>



<p>Small or large piece of work is not important in my though. Ideas is more important</p>



<p>Have you ever heard and remembered the story of one piece of paper of famous scientific rule written by Einstein. A long article with non sense and poor idea content is not uncommon and many authors use predatory (paid) journal to be their portal for publication, which I totally not agree for that idea.</p>



<p>in Asian, we have idiom &#8220;have a quater first then you will get the complete whole one&#8221;</p>



<p>If you rely on only large long thing and devalue of the short message, there will not be scientific progression.</p>



<p>Another point that I do not publish long work since I already notify that there is no money to support my team academic work.</p>



<p>At present, I usually act as supervisor to my junior colleage and most of them are from poor Asian countries and have no mney to pay for the expensive publication charge so they usually write a short piece of work to correspond and manage the problem of publication charge.</p>



<p>Publishing short scientific letter usually cost me and may team no charge. Perhaps, if there is any financial support externally, a longer article might be focused (maybe, in your setting, USA??, there might be funding to support those junior authors who have willingness to do the academic work).</p>



<p>One who publish few works might publish either good or non sense work or ethical or non ethical work. This is the same for the high profilic author as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last, as I told do not count on other work. Counting on number of other work can let you feel fatique and loss of hope to reach the target. In some cases, a bad person might feel jealous and thing bad when he/she see the other has more success. This is an important take home message that I usually teach my junior.</p>



<p><strong>Any summary thoughts?</strong></p>



<p>[I] would like to let take home message for any beginner that 1. If you do not walk, you will not reach the target.&nbsp; 2. Rome does not built in one day!&nbsp; 3. Do a good thing by your own first. God will not help anyone who do not help his/her own self. &nbsp; 4. Do not count on other success but look to improve your ownself. Don&#8217;t waste time, everything has to start from 0 before it reach the infinity.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/open-science-by-discipline/">How does Open Science practice differ between research disciplines?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by </em><a href="mailto:lcadwallader@plos.org"><em>Lauren Cadwallader</em></a><em> and </em><a href="mailto:linds.morton@gmail.com"><em>Lindsay Morton</em></a></p>



<p>Different research communities have different priorities, needs, norms, and challenges in communicating their research&mdash;it&rsquo;s no surprise, therefore, that adoption of Open Science practices also differs across topics and disciplines. Open Science Indicators (OSIs) illuminate patterns in Open Science adoption across disciplines in a way that hasn&rsquo;t been possible before. We&rsquo;re excited to share preliminary observations on disciplinary differences in the adoption of Open Science practices based on the most recent <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">OSI dataset</a>.</p>



<h2>About this analysis</h2>



<p>Open Science Indicators (OSIs) use Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence to identify and quantify Open Science practices. The most recent dataset encompasses all 74,130 PLOS research articles published between January 1 2019 and March 31 2023 and a comparator set of 8,186 Open Access articles drawn from PMC. The Open Science practices measured are data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting.</p>



<p>The OSI dataset includes the DOI of every article analyzed, making it easy to match against the range of taxonomies in use at indexing and archiving services that capture disciplinary data. For this analysis, we&rsquo;ve chosen the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/classifications/australian-and-new-zealand-standard-research-classification-anzsrc/latest-release">Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC)</a> taxonomy, as applied to Dimensions data, because it is an Open classification system and so can be extracted and recreated easily.</p>



<p>A single paper may fit within more than one topic definition, and so may be counted more than once in the analysis that follows.</p>



<h2>Data repository use</h2>



<p><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">Data</a> shared in any format has value, but for maximum discoverability, access, and utility, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/10/data-repository/">data repositories are considered the gold standard</a>. We focus our analysis on repository use, but rates of data sharing broadly may be calculated from the OSI dataset as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data repository use varies widely, both across disciplines, and between PLOS and comparator articles within the same discipline. For PLOS articles, the disciplines with the lowest rates of data repository use are Health Sciences (19% for PLOS, 6% for comparators) and Biomedical &amp; Clinical Sciences (19% for PLOS, 10% for comparators)&mdash;both fields likely to be affected by privacy considerations. Among the other disciplines with below average rates of repository usage are Engineering, Agriculture, and Earth Sciences, where proprietary data is common. The comparator dataset shows similar but not identical results, with Engineering (5%) and Health Sciences (6%) having the lowest adoption rates.</p>



<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum are Information &amp; Computing Sciences, Psychology, and Biological Sciences. The high rate of adoption in the Biological Sciences, and the similarity between the PLOS and comparator rates in the field, suggests a combination of disciplinary norms and mandated data deposition requirements.&nbsp;</p>

Dashed lines show the overall average repository use for all topics in each cohort (PLOS = 26%; comparators = 13%).</sub></p>



<p></p>



<p>When we examine the types of repositories used most often by discipline, Biological Sciences, Agriculture, and Biomedical &amp; Clinical Sciences are most likely to use a specialist repository with a more narrow discipline-specific scope&mdash;again probably influenced by mandated deposition for sequencing, genetic, crystallography, and macromolecular data.</p>

Note that each article may have more than one repository associated with it and therefore some topics tally to more than 100%.</sub></p>



<h2>Code sharing</h2>



<p>Augmenting a research article with publicly available <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-code/">code</a> enhances understanding, facilitates reproducibility and reanalysis, promotes trust, and saves other researchers time and effort.</p>



<p>Interestingly, code generation does not appear to have a strong relationship with code sharing. In topic areas with high rates of code generation, code-sharing rates were widely distributed. For example, Mathematics, Information and Computing Sciences, and the Physical Sciences exhibit higher rates of both code generation and sharing, while the Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences, and Chemical Sciences had equally high rates of code generation, but&nbsp; much lower rates of code sharing. </p>



<p>Instead, code-sharing behavior appears highly correlated with data shared in a repository, suggesting that established data-sharing norms (<em>not</em> the prevalence/relevance of code) are the deciding factor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="554" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/combined-code-and-repo-by-discipline-for-blog-1024x554.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21531" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/combined-code-and-repo-by-discipline-for-blog-1024x554.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/combined-code-and-repo-by-discipline-for-blog-300x162.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/combined-code-and-repo-by-discipline-for-blog-768x415.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/combined-code-and-repo-by-discipline-for-blog.png 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><sub>Figure 3. Rates of data shared in a repository plotted alongside the rates of code shared and generated for each topic. Data from the PLOS and comparator datasets have been combined for each topic.</sub></p>



<h2>Preprint posting</h2>



<p><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">Preprints</a> empower researchers to take more control over their scientific communications, sharing early in order to establish priority, broadcast results, seek community feedback, increase readership, and bolster grant, job or tenure applications.</p>



<p>We explored preprint posting patterns over time and by region as part of our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/#preprints">2022 year-end analysis</a>. Parsing the data by discipline shows that the Biological Sciences display the highest rates of preprint posting for both the PLOS and comparator cohorts. This makes sense, given that biology is one of the largest topic areas published at PLOS, and biology preprint server bioRxiv was our first official partner server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS has also established preprint server partnerships in the Biomedical and Clinical Sciences with medRxiv, and more recently the Earth and Environmental Sciences, with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">EarthArXiv</a>&mdash;both topic areas where PLOS publishes relatively high volumes of papers. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that in the Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, preprint rates across PLOS and comparator articles are very similar. This parity may indicate, for example, that the convenience of facilitated posting&nbsp; less strongly influences the decision to preprint in this discipline. In Earth and Environmental Sciences, rates are generally lower than portfolio average, and vary by subdiscipline relative to comparators. Other future avenues of exploration might include investigation into the most popular servers by discipline, as well as when preprints are posted relative to journal submission date.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-stars-dark-matter">The James Webb telescope may have spotted stars powered by dark matter</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has spotted objects in the early universe that might be a new kind of star — one powered by dark matter.</p>



<p>These “dark stars” are still hypothetical. Their identification in JWST images is far from certain. But if any of the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2305762120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three candidates</a> — reported in the July 25 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> — turn out to be this new type of star, they could offer a glimpse of star formation in the early universe, hint at the nature of dark matter and possibly explain the origins of supermassive black holes.</p>





<p>First proposed in 2007 by cosmologist Katherine Freese and colleagues, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twinkle-twinkle-dark-matter-may-have-lit-first-stars">dark stars might have been some of the first types of stars</a> to form in the universe (<em>SN: 1/1/08</em>). Though dark stars have yet to be observed, they’re thought to be powered by heat from dark matter interactions rather than by nuclear fusion reactions like in the sun.</p>



<p>Dark stars “would be very weird looking,” says Freese, of the University of Texas at Austin. The hypothetical stars would have formed from clouds of hydrogen and helium that drew in locally abundant dark matter as they coalesced. Though the true nature of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics">dark matter</a> isn’t known — its presence is inferred largely via its effect on how stars move within galaxies — it’s possible that dark matter particles can interact with themselves, annihilating each other when they collide and producing vast amounts of light and heat (<em>SN: 7/7/22</em>). That heat would keep the cloud of hydrogen and helium from condensing into a dense, hot core like the stars that exist today.</p>



<p>Because the heat from dark matter annihilations would keep the gas cloud from condensing, dark stars could grow to gargantuan size. Theoretically, dark stars could be 10 times as wide as Earth’s orbit around the sun. They could also be millions of times as massive as the sun and shine billions of times brighter — bright enough, potentially, to be spotted by JWST.</p>



<p>To see if any dark stars are lurking in data from the orbiting observatory, Freese and colleagues pored over images from a JWST survey of early galaxies. In such images, JWST has so far discovered over 700 objects that may have originated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-time-galaxy">in the first few hundred million years of the universe</a> — the epoch when dark stars would have emerged (<em>SN: 12/16/22</em>). Light from these remote objects is stretched, or redshifted, as the universe expands. So Freese and colleagues zeroed in on four objects already confirmed to be highly redshifted, making them some of the oldest objects seen to date.</p>



<p>Those objects are currently thought to be small galaxies from the universe’s relative infancy. But because they’re so far away, JWST can’t resolve them well enough to determine whether they’re actually galaxies or large, ultrabright stars, the researchers say.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="551" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline.jpg" alt="An image from the James Webb Space Telescope with an arrow pointing at JADES-GS-z13-0." class="wp-image-3129792" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline-473x383.jpg 473w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline-555x450.jpg 555w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline-230x186.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129792">Three dark star candidates were identified from data collected by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. One of the candidates, JADES-GS-z13-0, is shown here (arrow).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129792">NASA, ESA, CSA, JADES Collaboration</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team ran computer simulations of how much light a hypothetical dark star might produce at various wavelengths. They compared those spectra to light from images collected by JWST at different wavelengths for each of the four objects. JWST data from three of those objects are consistent with the simulated dark star patterns, Freese and colleagues report.</p>



<p>Some scientists are skeptical. Known types of stars could also create the observed light from the three candidates, says Sandro Tacchella, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge. And identifying any of the objects as a dark star would require that the simulated patterns fit well to more detailed spectra, says Brant Robertson, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>



<p>If dark stars were to be found, though, “that would be revolutionary,” says study coauthor Cosmin Ilie, an astrophysicist at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y.</p>



<p>Detecting dark stars would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics">confirm the existence of a dark matter particle</a> and hint at how it works (<em>SN: 7/7/22</em>). “Just having the information that [dark matter] is something that could annihilate would be really, really powerful,” says Tracy Slatyer, a theoretical physicist at MIT who was not involved in the study. That knowledge could help scientists look for dark matter elsewhere in the universe, she says.</p>





<p>Dark stars could also help explain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-cant-figure-out-why-some-black-holes-got-so-big-so-fast">the formation of supermassive black holes</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/18</em>). Once the dark matter inside the star has annihilated itself, the remaining hydrogen and helium — millions of times the mass of the sun in a relatively compact space — would collapse in on itself and form a black hole. Those black holes could merge over time into black holes like the ones at the centers of most galaxies, millions or billions of times as massive as the sun.</p>



<p>Future experiments, like looking for brighter or dimmer light at certain wavelengths, could help confirm whether any of the three objects are dark stars. Freese also expects to find more dark star candidates in future JWST data, she says. But for now, whether dark stars truly exist remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-embryo-replica-complex-advanced">Human embryo replicas have gotten more complex. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some newly reported clumps of cells growing in lab dishes have been hailed as the closest things to human embryos that scientists have ever made in the lab.</p>



<p>These entities are human embryo models — masses of cells created from stem cells that mimic some properties of certain stages of embryo development. The achievement gives researchers a chance to look at human development beyond the first week or so, when an embryo must implant in the uterus to develop further. That post-implantation stage hadn’t been re-created in lab dishes — until now.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Six studies reported in June and July describe the embryo models, which have generated excitement and concern in equal measure.</p>



<p>For researchers working on these embryo models, the faux embryos are new tools to gain insight into the “black box” of human development, after embryos implant in the uterus. They are useful because donated human embryos are in short supply, and there are limits on the types of experiments researchers can perform on them.</p>



<p>About 60 percent of pregnancies fail just before, during or soon after implantation, developmental and stem cell biologist Magdalena Żernicka-Goetz of the University of Cambridge and Caltech said June 27 during a news briefing discussing an embryo model made in her lab. Insights gleaned from the embryo models may give new understanding of why many pregnancies fail to take hold and lead to better fertility treatments, Żernicka-Goetz said.</p>



<p>But others worry that the models — along with eggs and sperm made from stem cells — raise the specter of researchers using the mimics to create babies. Scientists developing the models say reproduction is not their aim or intention, and that implantation in a uterus is impossible with these embryo models.</p>



<p>Still, the research raises issues of how to — and whether to — regulate what scientists can do with embryo-like entities made from stem cells. Questions surround whether embryo models could or should be grown past the equivalent of 14 days of normal human development after fertilization. And critics warn that overstating what the models are or can do could risks damaging trust in science.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> talked to scientists and ethicists to learn more about these human embryo models.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are human embryo models?</h4>



<p>Before answering that question, Amander Clark, president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, says we first need to understand that a human embryo is the product of fertilization of an egg and sperm.</p>



<p>Embryo models, on the other hand, self-assemble from pluripotent stem cells — ones that have the power to make nearly any type of cell in the body. “Therefore, embryo models do not meet the clinical, medical or scientific definition of an embryo because they do not originate from the product of fertilization by two gametes,” says Clark, a stem cell scientist, developmental biologist and geneticist at UCLA.</p>



<p>For years, scientists have studied the first week or so of human development using donated human embryos or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blastoid-stem-cells-fertility-research">embryo models</a> (<em>SN: 1/5/22</em>). From those, researchers learned a great deal about the formation of the ball of cells known as a blastocyst. Blastocysts have an outer layer of cells that will form the placenta and other support systems for the developing embryo, and an inner cluster of cells that will give rise to the body.</p>





<p>But it&#8217;s the next few weeks of life when the real action happens, says stem cell biologist and embryologist Jacob Hanna of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. Between day seven and about day 35 after fertilization is when the embryo builds all its organs. “It moves from a ball of cells to a structure that anybody on the street … would tell you, &#8216;This is an embryo.&#8217; And then the rest of the other eight months are just growth of the embryo,” he says.</p>



<p>Researchers have assembled embryo models that contain some, but not all, of the types of cells necessary for normal development. The newly reported embryo models mimic structures that would be found in an embryo that has implanted in a uterus, even though the mimics have nothing to implant into. The models are simulating a very specific window of embryo development: “the events that occur as an embryo implants, how the embryo self-assembles,&#8221; Clark says. &#8220;Then essentially they collapse.”</p>



<p>None of the models completely copy a real embryo, she says. For instance, none make a very good trophectoderm, the layer of cells that gives rise to the placenta later in development. That layer is important for an embryo to implant into the uterus, and it also sends signals that help the rest of the embryo develop properly.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How did the latest buzz about embryo models start?</h4>



<p>Post-implantation embryo models drew media attention when Żernicka-Goetz presented preliminary findings in the closing moments of a talk she gave June 13 in Boston at a meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research. The <em>Guardian</em> newspaper hailed the work as a breakthrough that created synthetic human embryos.</p>

Other researchers are skeptical of the claim.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129911">University of Cambridge</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That characterization overstates the achievement, says Alfonso Martinez Arias, a developmental biologist at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. The work is not a breakthrough, but an incremental advance, and is far from re-creating an embryo, he says.</p>



<p>Żernicka-Goetz and colleagues genetically engineered human stem cells to resemble three types of cells necessary for embryo development: cells that mimic the important placenta-generating trophectoderm, cells that resemble ones that will form the yolk sac that feeds the embryo until the placenta takes over, and ones that form the epiblast — the cells inside the embryo that will develop into the body. The resulting balls of cells <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06368-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resemble some aspects of human embryos</a>, the team reported June 27 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>For instance, the trophectoderm layer forms on the outside of the embryo-like structure as it does in embryos. But it doesn’t make proteins typical for that layer when assembled in a 3-D structure, so it isn’t truly a placental precursor, coauthor Bailey Weatherbee of the University of Cambridge said during the news briefing. But the layer is necessary for the rest of the embryo model to assemble, suggesting it performs some of the functions of the trophectoderm, she said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How were other embryo models made?</h4>



<p>Like Żernicka-Goetz’s team, all the research groups started with human stem cells. Carefully controlling growing conditions and the numbers of certain types of cells added to the mix allowed the stem cells to grow into embryo-like structures. The models differ in the number of cell types they contain and in the features of real embryos they’re able to mimic.</p>



<p>One group of researchers coaxed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06354-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells to form embryo-like structures</a> with two tissue layers. That work, also described June 27 in <em>Nature</em>, didn’t use genetic manipulation or chemicals to induce the stem cells to form embryo-like structures. Instead, the researchers relied on stem cells’ ability to self-organize, says developmental biologist Berna Sozen of Yale School of Medicine.</p>



<p>The resulting model lacks the trophectoderm. When the researchers realized the tissue was missing, they thought its absence might tell them something about its importance, she says. “In the absence of these tissues you can see what will happen, what doesn&#8217;t happen, and then you [get] very strong scientific insights [about] why you need that tissue.”</p>



<p>Another effort by researchers in China and Michigan, described in a not-yet-peer reviewed preprint posted June 16 online at bioRxiv.org, is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.15.545180v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technically impressive</a>, Martinez Arias says. But it still lacks a placenta precursor layer.</p>



<p>Most recently, a team led by Jun Wu of the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas persuaded stem cells to form <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00794-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embryo-like entities</a> that span the rearrangement event called gastrulation, the researchers report July 20 in <em>Cell</em>. During gastrulation embryos go from hollow spheres of cells to multilayered structures that will give rise to organs and tissues that form the body.</p>



<p>These “peri-gastruloid” models made some tissues resembling those in the early nervous system and may help confirm the origins of cells that will give rise to eggs and sperm. These models also contain a yolk sac, but “our model is not a complete model,” Wu says. “We don&#8217;t have the placenta tissue.”</p>

Cells resembling the epiblast (green) begin to form multiple layers of tissues like those that would form the body in an embryo.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129909">L. Lui <em>et al</em>/<em>Cell</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Because the models lack the trophectoderm, the researchers had to add proteins to anchor and support the gastruloids so they could develop properly.</p>



<p>A team of researchers in China reported preliminary results of similar <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.28.546720v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gastruloids with yolk sacs</a> June 28 at bioRxiv.org. That team found that the chemical thalidomide alters formation of the tissue layers and interrupts development.</p>



<p>In the future, researchers might use such models to understand how chemicals from the environment could affect developing embryos, Wu says.</p>



<p>Martinez Arias and others have previously made gastruloids that could model development up to day 19 after fertilization, but those earlier models didn’t have yolk sacs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Are any of the embryo models major advances?</h4>



<p>Of this “gold rush” of embryo models, only two are real advances, Martinez Arias says: Wu’s gastruloids and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.14.544922v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;embryo models</a> made by Hanna’s group. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Hanna’s models described in a June 15 preprint posted at bioRxiv.org, have a reasonable facsimile of both a yolk sac and the placenta precursor, Martinez Arias says, and make structures with “uncanny” resemblance to those of embryos at 14 days of development.</p>



<p>The process to achieve an embryo model so closely resembling the real thing was a long one, Hanna says. His team first worked out how to grow mouse embryos past this developmental stage in lab dishes. Using mouse embryos as their “experimental compass,” the researchers then figured out how to assemble a mouse embryo model from stem cells. From there, the team used the tricks they’d learned to grow human stem cells in conditions that coaxed them to self-assemble into structures approximating post-implantation embryos.</p>



<p>The self-assembly bypassed the blastocyst stage and moved directly to something akin to a post-implantation embryo, his team found. “Maybe the embryo [models] are deficient because we don&#8217;t go to through the blastocyst [stage]. I don&#8217;t think so. But I can&#8217;t exclude it at the moment,” Hanna says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Can these embryo models result in babies?</h4>



<p>No, but that question always comes up.</p>



<p>Scientists are interested in technical and biological advances the new embryo models bring. But for most people, “it&#8217;s really the possibility that they could be used for reproduction that that draws the attention,” says Katie Hasson, associate director of the Center for Genetics and Society, a nonprofit social justice organization based in Berkeley, Calif.</p>



<p>It’s not possible to use these embryo models for reproduction, scientists say. “Not only is it illegal to put these late stage [embryo models] inside the uterus, but actually if I wanted to, or anyone wanted to, these structures can never implant,” Hanna says. Implantation happens only when embryos consist of one to 64 cells. These post-implantation models have moved beyond that stage. Biologically, he says, “it will never succeed.”</p>



<p>Wu agrees. “These models are not human embryos at all,” he says. “They are not able to generate any type of life. They are essentially just a cluster of cells.”</p>



<p>There are legal blocks to growing embryos in the lab past a certain stage as well. In the United Kingdom, the law forbids growing embryos past 14 days of development, the point at which the embryo turns on its body-building program. That limit was imposed shortly after in vitro fertilization became possible.</p>



<p>But some of these embryo models already resemble embryos at the 14-day stage of development. Since the models aren’t created through fertilization and could never give rise to a person, some researchers argue that they shouldn’t be subject to the 14-day rule.</p>



<p>In the United States, there is no law banning growing embryos past 14 days, but the 1995 Dickey-Wicker amendment prohibits the U.S. National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryos or embryo-like cells with “organismal potential,” Clark says. Since these models lack critical parts, they have no potential to make an organism — so research with embryo models can be funded.</p>



<p>The international stem cell society recently updated its guidelines, suggesting that if scientists want to culture embryos created by fertilization for longer than 14 days, they need to seek public approval in their jurisdiction. Since the models are not embryos, the society’s guidelines suggest that they can be cultured up until a structure called the primitive streak appears, signaling that the embryo is starting to build the body.</p>



<p>The goal for most scientists in the field is to understand the process by which cells assemble an embryo and then create all the organs and tissues of the body, Martinez Arias says. It’s neither necessary nor desirable, and perhaps not even possible, to build a perfect replica of an embryo. “I certainly do not think that that is something that we want to do, or that we should do or should say,” he says. “And that&#8217;s not something that is on the horizon.”</p>



<p>Even so, scientists need to hit the pause button to thoroughly evaluate the embryo-like structures and determine how they can aid in understanding human development, Martinez Arias says. “I hope that now we can all develop these systems in a manner that is useful for research, rather than trying to see how far into space we [can] go, without thinking [about] how we return.”</p>



<p>Conversations with the public about what the embryo models represent scientifically, philosophically and legally, and about how to use them ethically need to start now, Hasson says. “We need to think about them now because it&#8217;s not the case, and it shouldn&#8217;t be the case, that the technical limits of what scientists can currently do with these models should define the ethical discussion and what the ethical limits should be.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viking-age-ancient-solar-flare-trade-archaeology">How an ancient solar flare illuminated the start of the Viking Age</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Calamity after calamity befell Europe at the beginning of the so-called Dark Ages. The Roman Empire collapsed in the late fifth century. Volcanic eruptions in the mid-sixth century blocked out the sun, causing crop failure and famine across the Northern Hemisphere. Meanwhile, the Justinian Plague arrived, killing, by some estimates, nearly half of everybody in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, and scores of others elsewhere.</p>



<p>And then, on June 8, 793, a group of marauders attacked a small island off the northeastern coast of Great Britain. As Christian monks noted in the <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em>, “heathen men destroyed God’s church in Lindisfarne island by fierce robbery and slaughter.”</p>





<p>With that description, the Vikings entered the annals of medieval history as merciless raiders, having also killed a local official in southern Great Britain in 789. From today’s perspective, these Norse seafarers burst into existence seemingly out of nowhere.</p>



<p>Exactly when and why the Vikings first turned their boats away from shore to sail south over the horizon and into the unknown is hotly debated. According to some historians, another development in the late eighth century offers a clue: Silver coins known as dirhams made their way to Europe from the Islamic world in the Middle East. Around this time, Viking men in what is now Norway and Sweden became obsessed with silver as a means to purchase brides made scarce by female infanticide, or so a popular theory holds. A desperate need for silver, it was thought, motivated the Vikings’ initial trips across the North and Baltic seas and somehow precipitated their infamous raids.</p>



<p>Other historians, however, suspect the Vikings’ first forays into the outside world long preceded their violent raids and had nothing to do with a quest for silver.</p>



<p>“Our understanding of the chronology of the early Viking Age is really patchy because our best accounts are sometimes written 100 years later,” says Matthew Delvaux, a medieval historian at Princeton University. That includes the description of the Lindisfarne raid in the <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em>.</p>



<p>Fortunately, medieval scholars have recently found another aid to turn to: a solar storm.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Søren Sindbæk and his colleagues at Aarhus University in Denmark have reconstructed the timing of the Vikings’ early voyages by harnessing the power of what was likely a supermassive solar flare that erupted in 775. The flare has helped the team improve radiocarbon dating and thus more precisely date artifacts excavated at Ribe, Denmark, the site of an early medieval trading post.</p>



<p>The chronology of events at Ribe reveals a less violent start for Viking voyages, at least 50 years before the Lindisfarne raid. The secret of Viking success, Sindbæk believes, is best explained by skillful trading, not fearsome raiding.</p>



<p>More precise radiocarbon dating has the potential to reveal other aspects of the medieval world once thought lost to history.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Viking Age archaeology at Ribe</h4>



<p>Since the 1970s, archaeologists have been probing Ribe, on the North Sea, for artifacts that could help explain one of the deepest mysteries in medie­val history: how, within the span of mere decades, hardscrabble farmers wedged between dangerous seas and impenetrable forests became the Vikings who dominated Europe for nearly 300 years — a period known as the Viking Age.</p>





<p>At some point, a few highly motivated seafarers from the Scandinavian Peninsula made it across the treacherous 100-kilometer Skagerrak strait to Ribe. There, among a cluster of thatched single-story houses on a sandy outcrop rising above a tidal marsh, the Vikings left clues to why they had come.</p>



<p>Sindbæk imagines how Ribe, already a marketplace for settlements to the south, would’ve looked to those early Vikings. “What would impress you at first sight would be all those masts,” he says. “There would be more ships than you’ve ever seen in your life.”</p>



<p>Ribe, Denmark’s oldest town, eventually linked trade routes crisscrossing across northern Europe. The artifacts excavated along its narrow streets reveal when the early Vikings first arrived and where they spread next, expanding their influence around the region.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Early medieval trade routes in northern Europe</h3>



<p>In the early medieval period, Ribe was a hub of international trade, with trade routes bringing goods from across northern Europe and the Middle East. Dashed lines show routes where goods probably passed through intermediaries before heading to Ribe.</p>

<p>Starting in June 2017 for 15 consecutive months, Sindbæk’s group uncovered extensive <a href="https://projects.au.dk/northernemporium/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence of trade in Ribe</a>, starting around the year 700. In clay floors of houses that had functioned as both residences and workshops, the Aarhus team found glass beads, including a kaleidoscopic array of colorful Middle Eastern beads, embedded among debris from prolific metalworking, hide preparation, weaving and bone carving. These were all telltale remains of a Viking Age trading town, where a variety of people met, mingled and hawked their wares.</p>



<p>And they did so peacefully. There is virtually no archeological evidence of violent conflict in Ribe, contrary to the popular myth of Vikings as bloodthirsty barbarians.</p>



<p>“From the beginning Ribe seems to have been a sort of safe haven. You can land here, you’ll be safe. We’re not going to plunder you. We’ll try to outsmart you,” Sindbæk says.</p>



<p>In all, he and his colleagues unearthed more than 100,000 artifacts — tools, accessories and trinkets that would come to define Viking Age culture. In many cases, these objects were made with materials sourced from the Scandinavian Peninsula inhabited by the early Vikings. Some beauties stand out. A magnificent amber battle axe pendant hints at the Vikings’ warrior ethos. Combs carved from reindeer antlers display intricate designs. Terrifying beasts adorn oval brooches. The face of the Viking god Odin graces coins. The artifacts had value beyond their utility or inherent beauty. Back home on the Scandinavian Peninsula, these prestige items gave social status to those who delivered or received them.</p>



<p>“You can kind of show off your ability to participate in these interregional networks the same way that we might show off our ability to purchase a foreign car,” Delvaux says.</p>



<p>Digging down through the centuries, there were many generations of workshops. Twenty shop floors strewn with artifacts. Two hundred years of continuous manufacturing activity compressed into 2½ vertical meters.</p>



<p>Richard Hodges, an archaeologist and past president of the American University of Rome, visited the site in 2018. It’s “a layer cake of superimposed workshops, one on top of another,” he says. “Some burned down. Some of them were just demolished. Every one of them was producing huge amounts of material culture.”</p>



<p>With the layers often bleeding together, the Aarhus team needed to radiocarbon-date each one to put the artifacts in a clear chronological order and reveal the timing of events that produced them.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The limitations of radiocarbon dating</h4>



<p>For decades, radiocarbon dating has been a go-to technique for archaeologists. It takes advantage of the fact that when living organisms take in carbon and incorporate it into their tissues, some fraction of the carbon is a radioactive version of the element. It takes 5,730 years for half of that radiocarbon to decay into a form of nitrogen. Knowing that half-life and the amount of radiocarbon in, say, a bone or piece of charcoal helps scientists calculate the age of that organic matter.</p>



<p>But the amount of radiocarbon in the atmosphere — and thus taken up by plants during photosynthesis and then by the animals that eat them — fluctuates over time, so scientists must calibrate their measurements to estimate a true calendar date. Tree rings are handy for this purpose; each one records the atmospheric radiocarbon content in the year it formed. Experts have used trees of known ages from around the world to compile a curve called IntCal20 that plots fluctuations in radiocarbon over the last 55,000 years to help researchers calibrate radiocarbon dates.</p>



<p>But IntCal20’s annual tree ring data are sparse for parts of the eighth and ninth centuries. So archaeologists haven’t been able to date Viking-era artifacts precisely enough to explain the Vikings’ emergence on the global stage.</p>



<p>To fill the gap, physicist Bente Philippsen, a member of the Aarhus team, performed her own calibration using oak tree specimens from the National Museum of Denmark — one of which befittingly had been part of a bridge built by Viking King Harald Bluetooth (the great unifier of people in Denmark and Norway in the 10th century after whom the eponymous device-linking technology is named).</p>

<p>But even with the extra calibration, Philippsen couldn’t narrow the possible age range of a given layer enough to know exactly when Vikings first arrived or when long-distance trading networks reached the town.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">An ancient solar flare boosts radiocarbon precision</h4>



<p>To zero in on the timing of these events, the Aarhus team looked to see if signs of an ancient solar flare were recorded at the site. In 775, a few literate observers in western Europe reported seeing the impact of a solar storm. Celestial phenomena streaking across the sky were described in various ways: a red cross, inflamed shields, fire from heaven. Some people saw “snakes” slither with the same movements as the aurora borealis.</p>



<p>At the atomic level, solar particles streaming into Earth’s atmosphere kicked off nuclear reactions that transformed some nitrogen atoms into an unstable variant of carbon with six protons and eight neutrons: the isotope carbon-14, or radiocarbon.</p>



<p>Typically, 99 percent of atmospheric carbon is carbon-12, which has six protons and six neutrons. Only one in a trillion atoms of the remaining 1 percent is carbon-14; the rest is carbon-13. But these ratios vary ever-so-slightly over time due to carbon-14’s unstable nature. In 775, the solar storm created 1.2 percent more carbon-14 than usual. That ratio of carbon isotopes became imprinted on any organisms alive at the time.</p>



<p>Physicist Fusa Miyake of Nagoya University in Japan and colleagues first <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered this 775 spike in radiocarbon</a> about a decade ago, in the rings of Japanese cedar trees. Counting the annual rings, she was able to pinpoint the year of the solar storm. It turns out that the sun has on several occasions, about once every millennium and a half or so it appears, sent flares in our direction with enough energy to make measurably more carbon-14.</p>



<p>So while the Aarhus team peeled back layer upon layer of wet clay and sand along one of Ribe’s ancient streets, Philippsen set out to see if any of those layers might date to 775. Up to her elbows in mud and clay at the site, she searched for the right bits of organic material to date.</p>



<p>“I’ve been trained in all the [excavation] methods, so it’s safe for them to let me be in the trench and work, and you get a really good understanding of the samples,” Philippsen says.</p>



<p>Of all the startling finds in Ribe, the site’s trash held the most potential to shed light on the origins of Viking Age trade. Twigs, rye, barley, oats, nutshells and other refuse still lying around more than 1,000 years later possibly bore the time stamp of the supermassive flare.</p>



<p>Philippsen shuttled between her lab at Aarhus and the dig at Ribe with 140 samples plucked from different workshop layers. Trading her trowel for a scalpel, she diced up her bits of ancient oak and ran them along with samples from the site through the lab’s accelerator mass spectrometer, which counts carbon-12 and carbon-14 atoms by sorting them according to mass.</p>



<p>Two pieces of charcoal and a hazelnut shell from a combmaker’s workshop turned out to have the same ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 as the oak tree rings dated to 775.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ribe is a time capsule of early medieval trade</h4>



<p>Once Philippsen identified a workshop layer dated to 775, every other workshop and its artifacts above and below fell into a decade-by-decade chronological order. And with that sequence, Sindbæk and colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04240-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pieced together the evolution of trade at Ribe</a>, reporting the findings in 2022 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Around the year 700, ceramics and repurposed Roman glass appear at Ribe, indicating trade with the Franks of the Rhine Valley in what’s now Germany. By the 740s, early Vikings were arriving in ships large enough to carry blocks of Swedish and Norwegian stone. In the 750s, reindeer antler appears from a species not found outside of Norway’s hinterlands — more signs of a Viking presence. Craftspeople in town turned those bulk items into sought-after combs and sharpening stones. In exchange, vendors probably offered the early Vikings beads and brooches that would become the ubiquitous hallmarks of the Viking Age. These items also show up later in other Viking trading towns, such as Birka in Sweden. Finally, around 790, a cache of beautiful beads arrived in Ribe, likely via Russia, indicating new Middle Eastern trade connections.</p>

After the introduction of those beads, black-and-yellow-striped beads made in Ribe disappear. <em>Click to enlarge</em>.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129847">Museum of Southwest Jutland</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This scenario strongly suggests, if not proves, that Viking explorations began as regional trading expeditions, not as a desperate bid for Middle Eastern silver, Sindbæk’s team argues.</p>



<p>Given the similar timing, the possibility that the raids somehow relate to Middle Eastern trade goods just then finding their way into northern Europe raises important questions.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing this intensification of [Middle] Eastern trade on the Scandinavian periphery of the North Sea, and that precedes the intensification of Viking raiding in the British Isles,” Delvaux says. “Did this trade stimulate the raids? Were they raiding so they would pick up things to engage in Eastern trade? Did the raids start because people wanted to compete with Eastern trade? I could trade with the Muslims for silver or else I can raid the English for it, right?” Delvaux asks rhetorically.</p>



<p>Regardless, the solar flare clearly demarcates a moment of first contact between emerging civilizations. Sindbæk can imagine how it happened.</p>



<p>The Middle Eastern beads, he says, probably traveled north from the Mesopotamian heartland in several-pound bags before being handed over to a merchant in present-day Turkey, who probably followed nomadic trails north to the forest steppe somewhere in northern Ukraine. There, the merchant may have met Vikings who had come east across the Baltic Sea and exchanged the beads for furs or enslaved people. The beads dispersed through Scandinavian markets, ultimately arriving in Ribe.</p>



<p>Ribe is awash in these imported beads after 790, while the locally made black-and-yellow-striped “wasp beads” individually crafted exclusively in Ribe disappear from the archaeological record. The reason, the Aarhus team concludes, is competition.</p>



<p>Craftspeople living several thousand kilometers away mass-produced beads by dicing up long rods of glass. People now had to ask themselves: “Do I want the beads that are made by Sven on the corner, or do I want the beads Olaf is bringing in from God-knows-where, but he could give me 30 of them for the same price that Sven can make me one?” Delvaux says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Future questions to address</h4>



<p>The solar flare in 775 and a slightly weaker one in 993 with a distinct carbon spike have revealed how Vikings were trying to touch every corner of the globe. Using that 993 solar flare, another group of archaeologists finally confirmed when Vikings lived in North America. Wooden objects at the L’Anse aux Meadows site in Newfoundland, Canada, hold the signature of the 993 flare. Counting tree rings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03972-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed when the timbers to make those objects had been cut</a> — in the year 1021, the team reported in 2022 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_vikings_inline-5-800x450.jpg" alt="photo of a reconstructed settlement at L’Anse aux Meadows" class="wp-image-3129844" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_vikings_inline-5-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_vikings_inline-5-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_vikings_inline-5-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_vikings_inline-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_vikings_inline-5.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129844">The Vikings briefly lived in Newfoundland, Canada, at L’Anse aux Meadows (reconstructed settlement shown).

<p>Vikings weren’t the only ones reaching beyond their horizons at the time. A diverse set of trader-explorers in Afro-Eurasia also survived perilous sea crossings and found each other in towns akin to Ribe. Solar flare–aided radiocarbon dating could bring their stories to light as well.</p>



<p>“We can put different cultures and regions on the same timeline, no matter whether they had a tradition of history writing or not,” Philippsen says. “This makes it much easier to study contacts and the causes and effects of developments in different parts of the world. Environmental and climate records are also dated by radiocarbon … we can also check how societies responded to climate change, and how cultural developments are connected with changes in the environment.”</p>



<p>Archaeologist Mark Horton of the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, England, agrees that solar flares “enable us to create a much more precise timetable for history.” But in trading towns around the Indian Ocean where he works, for example, dead trees decay out of existence very quickly, leaving huge gaps in the radiocarbon calibration curve for the Southern Hemisphere, SHCal20, making it more difficult to fill them in as Philippsen did.</p>



<p>Next up for Philippsen is helping Aarhus archaeologist Sarah Croix radiocarbon-date early Christian graves to test King Harald Bluetooth’s claim that he converted Denmark to Christianity. If the graves predate his rule, then Bluetooth would’ve been, let’s say, exaggerating.</p>



<p>“Radiocarbon dating now approaches the precision of traditional historical sources, so it becomes relevant for studying ‘recent’ history, not only prehistory,” Philippsen says. “We can thus study the lives of individuals who are not mentioned in historical sources, i.e., ‘normal people,’ with the same chronological precision as those of the rulers, the literate, or whoever wrote or was written about.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-mission-boulder-asteroid-space">NASA’s DART mission lofted a swarm of boulders into space</a></h4>

              
                <p>When a probe smashed into a small asteroid last year, the collision did more than change the asteroid’s orbit — it blasted a few dozen hefty boulders into space too.</p>



<p>Last September, NASA steered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">the DART spacecraft into Dimorphos</a>, a moonlet of the larger asteroid Didymos, to test a strategy for knocking any future Earth-bound asteroids off course (<em>SN: 10/11/22</em>). About three months after the impact, the Hubble Space Telescope spied <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ace1ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a halo of 37 previously unseen objects</a> accompanying the space rock duo in their orbit around the sun, researchers report in the July 21<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters.</em></p>





<p>The boulders probably aren’t bits that were pulverized from larger rocks during the impact. Instead, simulations suggest they were likely intact when they were blasted off Dimorphos and could have been launched off the moonlet’s rubble-covered surface by the energy of either the collision or the seismic waves bouncing around inside it in the wake of the impact.</p>



<p>Still, “there’s a lot of uncertainty in such simulations,” planetary astronomer David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Based on the brightness of the new objects, some of the dimmest ever spied by Hubble in our solar system, Jewitt and colleagues estimate that these boulders may be as wide as 7 meters. At least 15 are larger than 4 meters across. Together, the researchers calculate, the boulders probably weigh just over 5 million kilograms — roughly the weight of 300 dump truck loads of gravel.</p>



<p>Repeated observations by Hubble reveal that, on average, the boulders are drifting away from Dimorphos and Didymos at about 1 kilometer per hour — a little faster than the escape velocity for the double asteroid system. So, Jewitt says, the boulders, as well as a presumed multitude of rocks too small and dim for Hubble to see, will eventually break away from the asteroid system’s orbit and circle the sun on their own.</p>

<p>Sage Publishing is retracting 37 articles from an engineering journal after finding “indicators of third party involvement” in the peer review process. </p>



<p>The publisher’s investigation continues, and more papers may be retracted, a spokesperson for the company told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A single <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09544089231188713">retraction notice</a> lists the links of the 37 papers to be retracted from <em>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E: Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering</em>. The notice states: </p>



<span id="more-127573"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After an internal investigation Sage became aware that the peer-review process for these articles had been compromised and contains indicators of third-party involvement.</p>



<p>As these were accepted because of a peer-review process that did not meet Sage’s expectations of high quality and ethical peer-review, the publisher cannot uphold the integrity of the research. In line with COPE guidelines and Sage policies, these articles are retracted.</p>



<p>The authors have been informed of this decision using the email addresses provided at submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00713">Ooi Kim Tiow</a>, the journal’s editor in chief and an associate provost at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only one of the papers has attracted notice on PubPeer. In June of last year, sleuth Alexander Magazinov <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F62C83E94CD638BD4744AA87C727DB#1">commented</a> that “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09544089221082489">Applications of fractional derivatives in MHD free-convective oscillating flow of a blood based CNTs nanofluid across a porous medium</a>” contained “A hollow sentence with a bulk citation to the benefit of a certain YM Chu.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early this year, Sage became aware of concerns with the journal’s content after one article “showed indicators of third party activity and compromised peer review,” a spokesperson said. The publisher began an investigation and reviewed “all submissions that showed indicators of suspicious activity. We asked which article tipped off the investigation, but Sage was not able to share the title by our deadline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sage is deeply committed to research integrity and righting the academic record. We have recently expanded our Research Integrity Group and have a full dedicated team who are actively working to guard against ethical misconduct – strengthening our use of tools and technology to undercover suspicious activity in papers, improving policies, and identifying journals where there may be similar issues. As a result, we anticipate further retractions to come as we uncover and address potential misconduct. We will continue to support our Editors and Assistant Editors in peer review best practices, and we have provided them with additional guidance on how to identify suspicious activity in journal submissions.</p>

<p>Sage was one of the first publishers to recognize large-scale peer review manipulation and begin retracting papers in bulk nine years ago. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/08/sage-publications-busts-peer-review-and-citation-ring-60-papers-retracted/">wrote</a> back in 2014 that a batch of 60 retractions involved in a peer review and citation ring “deserves a ‘wow.’” In recent years, however, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/20/new-record-major-publisher-retracting-100-studies-cancer-journal-fake-peer-reviews/">publishers</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/20/journal-retracts-more-than-400-papers-at-once/">have been</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/exclusive-plos-one-to-retract-more-than-100-papers-for-manipulated-peer-review/">retracting</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/23/publisher-retracts-350-papers-at-once/">even more</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">papers</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">at once</a> for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/20/deplorable-imaging-journal-to-retract-nearly-80-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">similar reasons</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the Sage spokesperson what’s changed since 2014, and if the systems put in place to catch such problems needed updating. The response:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve increased our investment in correcting the academic record and this is a sign of those efforts. We have recently put together a full team whose main purpose is to investigate these issues using new technology to help them along the way and then to improve policies and processes for the future. We have more than 1,100 journals so this can take time but we are very committed.</p>

<p>Other publishers have <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/21/research-misconduct-journals-hiring-research-integrity-czars/">long had such teams</a>, some for well over a decade.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-body-mapping-technique-mouse-organ">With a new body mapping technique, mouse innards glow with exquisite detail</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mouse’s entire nervous system lights up in psychedelic hues. Clumps of immune cells attacking tumors give off a ghostly glow. The vessels that make up the body’s sewer system flare brightly.</p>



<p>These and other images are shining a new light on the inner workings of mice, thanks to a new technique <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01846-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that makes whole body imaging cheaper and faster</a>, researchers report July 10 in <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>.</p>



<p>See-through mice <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/clearing-anatomy-see-through-mouse">are nothing new</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/14</em>). But existing techniques to image their insides can be expensive, time-consuming or don’t hit the right target. Now, a study shows that chemically removing cholesterol — an essential component of cell membranes — from dead mice creates spongelike holes in tissues without destroying them. That means tailored antibodies can move through the holes to infiltrate every corner of the body and bind to proteins of interest to make entire anatomical features visible under fluorescent light.</p>





<p>The technique, dubbed wildDISCO, gives scientists an extraordinarily thorough peek under mouse skin to create body-wide anatomical atlases. It’s a bit like Google Maps, says Ali Ertürk, a neuroscientist at Helmholtz Munich. But in place of cars driving around to record every street, antibodies act as streetlamps to illuminate scientific landmarks.</p>



<p>Such maps could help researchers train artificial intelligence programs to simulate bodily processes in mice. The algorithms would aim, for example, to simulate how a drug travels through blood vessels, or predict the path of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">genetically engineered immune cells</a> for cancer therapy, Ertürk says (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>). Computational simulations of biology may help researchers move away from doing animal experiments, he says.&nbsp;</p>

Mai <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Biotechnology </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To make the mice glow, Ertürk and colleagues pumped cholesterol-removing chemicals along with antibodies tagged with fluorescent molecular markers into the dead animals via the heart and blood vessels, a proven tactic that allows liquids to traverse the entire body. Then the team made all the tissues transparent, and the mice were ready for their close-ups.</p>



<p>One of the resulting maps depicts a comprehensive view of the network of nerves that runs beneath the skin and around organs. Another shows off the lymphatic system, an open network of organs and lymphatic vessels that helps fight off pathogens and transport cellular waste for removal.</p>



<p>These blueprints yielded some scientific nuggets.</p>



<p>Images taken of the nervous systems, for instance, showed that mice with no microbes in their bodies had underdeveloped nerve networks in their guts compared with normal mice, suggesting that the gut microbiome plays an important role in helping nerves develop.</p>



<p>And in mice with cancer, the team documented clumps of immune cells inside and near the tumors. The role that these clusters play in controlling cancer is unclear, Ertürk says. But wildDISCO offers scientists a way to investigate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>wildDISCO might also help with studies that focus on animals other than mice, says Yijun Su, an imaging specialist at Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va., who was not involved in the work. Scientists working with fruit flies, frogs or zebra fish might use a similar “recipe,” he says, to take clearer snapshots of their anatomy.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780226824918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Next Supercontinent</a><br><em>Ross Mitchell</em><br><em>Univ. of Chicago, $30</em></p>



<p>Today, there are seven continents. Some 200 million years from now, there will be just one. In <em>The Next Supercontinent</em>, geophysicist Ross Mitchell previews what the world might look like when Earth’s continents amalgamate into a single landmass.</p>



<p>Although Mitchell’s destination is the distant future, don’t be fooled. His book is as much a romp through the past as it is a look ahead, complete with references unique to the present (like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson helming a speedboat as it crests a highly improbable tsunami that ravages the Golden Gate Bridge in the movie <em>San Andreas</em>).</p>





<p>On the journey back in time, Mitchell visits how the continents came together in the past to form the previous supercontinents. He begins about 300 million to 200 million years ago with lush, dinosaur-laden Pangaea, which was centered on present-day Africa. He then goes back to a billion years ago to barren Rodinia, whose center consisted of much of today’s North America plus Greenland. Two billion years ago, there was what some scientists call Columbia — the Siberia-centric first supercontinent.</p>



<p>Tracking the paths of today’s continents through history takes some serious scientific sleuthing. This often begins with fieldwork to collect samples that constrain when a rock formed and its latitude at that time. To give readers a taste of such (mis)adventures, Mitchell shares how he lost half his right thumb in the Australian Outback while unearthing some of Rodinia’s mysteries, and when he and a colleague were nearly stranded with their samples on a frigid lake in Canada’s Northwest Territories.</p>



<p>Clues as to why supercontinents form in the first place and what causes their repeated rending also reside in an entirely different field of study — one in which scientists simulate how the “solid but pliable” mantle might have behaved to coax continents along. The mantle regulates the relationship between the crust and Earth’s core, which stores primordial heat. The supercontinent cycle, Mitchell argues, is linked to mantle movement that transfers Earth’s interior heat upward so the crust can release it.</p>



<p>As heat rises, scientists suspect, continents drift toward regions where the mantle is cold. These cold spots exist where oceanic plates subduct, or sink below more buoyant tectonic plates, into the mantle. Inch by inch, subducting ocean will disappear and bring continents closer together, resulting in a collision that will eventually culminate in a new supercontinent. Mantle simulations suggest that after the supersized landmass has formed, the incessant inward pull ceases as new subduction zones initiate at the coastlines of the supercontinent. Somewhere in the interior of the supercontinent, hot mantle rises, eventually causing the supercontinent to tear, forming new oceans and beginning another cycle.</p>



<p>Using the past to predict the future and understanding the mechanics of the mantle, Mitchell presents his vision of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">Amasia — the next supercontinent</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/17, p. 18</em>). Some researchers have suggested it will form from either the closing of the Pacific or Atlantic oceans. But he posits Amasia will form via the disappearance of the Arctic Ocean as the Americas and Eurasia meet near the North Pole, dragging the other continents along for the ride.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, Mitchell’s clear explanations and carefully chosen images help make sense of even the most complicated concepts (take it from a trained geologist who always had trouble with the particulars of the study of Earth’s past magnetic field — paleomagnetism — which often drive supercontinent reconstructions).</p>



<p>But whether Mitchell’s predictions are correct is something no reader will live long enough to find out, though maybe our descendants will. That will require humankind to survive far longer than any other known mammal. But given all our achievements as a species, Mitchell is hopeful we can beat the odds. “While such longevity may seem far-fetched,” he writes, “doesn’t it also sound a lot like us?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nature-exercise-happiness-psychology">Time in nature or exercise is touted for happiness. But evidence is lacking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Go on a run, hike through nature and meditate, and you’re basically guaranteed a happier life. At least, that’s what scores of listicles might lead you to believe. But a new review of hundreds of studies on happiness questions just how strong the evidence is for some of these happiness hacks.</p>



<p>The finding comes in the wake of the “replication crisis” in psychology, where the results of dozens of key psychological studies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-results-evaporate-upon-further-review">haven’t been able to be repeated</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/15</em>). In response, scientists have reassessed reams of old studies and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">doubled down on the best practices</a> for ensuring that new studies will hold up under scrutiny (<em>SN: 8/27/18</em>).</p>





<p>To find studies of happiness that applied these best practices, psychologists Dunigan Folk and Elizabeth Dunn of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver combed through hundreds of papers. The team focused on research that studied a large sample of people, which helps tease out real effects, and studies that were pre-registered, meaning that researchers outlined how they were going to conduct a study before starting it. That way, they can’t tweak it midway; it’s the scientific equivalent of calling your shot in pool.</p>



<p>Although studies of happiness were plentiful, studies that met these high standards were relatively scarce. And the evidence they offered, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01651-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially for exercise, meditation and time in nature</a>, was weaker than one might expect, the researchers report July 20 in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Dunn to discuss happiness, how we can get better at studying it and what science says works — and doesn’t — to build a happier life. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Why study happiness?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Science has given us our most essential human advances. It&#8217;s because of science that we got to the moon, that we have substantially increased longevity, that we have COVID vaccines. The scientific method is what solves our greatest challenges, and so I want to apply that method toward understanding happiness.</p>



<p>I think of happiness as being kind of the ultimate outcome measure. You know, whatever else we might be interested in, what ultimately matters is: “Are people leading happy lives?”</p>



<p>For me, understanding happiness is one of the fundamental mysteries and challenges of human existence.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>SN: </em>What gave you the idea to look into these past studies of happiness?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn: </strong>This research actually started with a question from a journalist who asked, ‘’These things we hear about in the media as being really important for happiness, like meditation and nature, how rigorous is the research behind those kinds of claims?”</p>



<p>I realized I didn&#8217;t know. We were inspired to go look at the scientific literature, really comb through it to understand how good the evidence is underlying commonly recommended strategies. We didn&#8217;t go in with an agenda, but rather just an open curiosity.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>So where did you start?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> First, we wanted to identify what strategies were most recommended to the public. So we googled phrases like “how to be happy” and identified media stories providing recommendations. Then we said, OK, these five strategies [practicing gratitude, meditating and being mindful, spending time in nature, being social and exercising] are really commonly recommended to the public as ways to be happier.</p>



<p>And then we combed through the literature and found every experiment that we could testing the effectiveness of these strategies for happiness. We wanted to look for studies that hold up to modern standards of what constitutes good evidence. We found over 500 studies examining these strategies, but fewer than 60 of them actually met contemporary standards for rigor.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>What did you find?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> The key takeaway here is that some of the strategies that have been widely recommended to the public as ways of improving happiness are not actually supported by very rigorous evidence.</p>



<p>What’s shocking to me is when we reviewed the literature on meditation, exercise and nature, of the hundreds of studies that we looked at, 95 percent of them didn&#8217;t include enough people that we would trust these studies by contemporary standards.</p>



<p>[Take exercise. Dunn and Folk found no study that both had a sufficiently large sample size and was pre-registered. They did find a dozen studies that included enough people to have meaningful conclusions. Five of those studies “found evidence that people feel happier after a single bout of exercise, but only in comparison with rather boring activities, such as sitting in silence or watching a documentary on bookbinding,” the researchers write in the paper. Similarly, the researchers found only four experiments that supported the happiness benefit of spending time in nature and had large enough sample sizes, though none were pre-registered either.]</p>



<p>Importantly, we&#8217;re certainly not saying that this is all snake oil. There are good reasons why these strategies should work. It&#8217;s just that there isn&#8217;t all that much rigorous evidence to show that they actually do work.</p>



<p>If something works for you, great. I&#8217;m not saying you should stop. It&#8217;s important to emphasize that if you&#8217;re, for example, dealing with an anxiety disorder and your therapist is recommending meditation, you know, we&#8217;re not saying ignore this advice. All we&#8217;re saying is that, for the average person trying to get a little bit happier, the evidence is maybe not there yet.</p>



<p>This is really a call to action to say, hey, we as researchers and as a society need to better understand these topics because they have been so widely embraced by the public and so widely disseminated by the media. We built our castles in the sky; you really need to get some foundations under them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Assessing happiness studies</h3>



<p>Of the hundreds of studies that experimentally tested common recommendations for happiness, only a handful met the gold standard for rigor (larger samples and pre-registered, in blue). Some have one or the other, and the majority didn&#8217;t have large sample sizes and weren&#8217;t pre-registered.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Even if there’s limited evidence, what’s the harm in, say, going for a walk in nature?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn: </strong>Most of these behaviors, like going for a nature walk or meditating, require time and effort. And as somebody who has a child and job, I can tell you time and effort are not in super strong supply.</p>



<p>Particularly for people who are working multiple jobs and have a lot of family responsibilities, finding even 20 minutes on a typical Tuesday where they can do something purely for themselves that they think will make them happy [can be hard]. How they use that 20 minutes really matters.</p>



<p>And they should be getting the best scientific guidance you can possibly give them about how to make the most of that scarce resource of time and of energy.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also a potential danger that people could [needlessly] feel like they failed. If they are like, “Well, nature and meditation make everybody happier, and they don&#8217;t work for me. I guess there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s gonna make me happier.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important that we not overstate the strength of the evidence behind these things.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Did any strategies seem to work in making people happier?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Gratitude comes out looking pretty good, and also chatting with strangers and acting more extroverted. I would always like for the evidence to be even stronger, but those are the strategies I would probably feel the best about recommending from our current review.</p>



<p>[There is “consistent evidence that people in diverse cultural contexts benefit from making gratitude lists,” Dunn and Folk write in the review paper. The researchers also found two studies that had large enough sample sizes and were pre-registered that found talking to strangers boosts mood. Another study that included enough people but wasn’t pre-registered had a similar finding.]</p>



<p>We have another paper in process where we looked at the best studies on happiness, meeting the modern gold standard. From that, there&#8217;s also pretty good evidence that spending money on others promotes happiness. And there&#8217;s good evidence that giving money to poor people makes them happier.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that [psychologists] know nothing about happiness. We do. It&#8217;s just that some of the strategies that have been so widely touted and disseminated are not actually among the sort of best and brightest to emerge from our field.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Do you have personal practices that help you be happier?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> [My past research has shown a link between] generosity and happiness. One thing that I&#8217;ve done with a group of friends was privately sponsor a family of Syrian refugees. Without really intending it this way, it was the perfect application of all of my research, and was probably the most rewarding experience I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>



<p>I also work out every day. It does put me in a really good mood. But this research has given me perhaps some humility in recognizing that that was the case for me. It&#8217;s not like other people would experience necessarily the same benefit as I do from that experience.</p>

<p>Florida State University last week terminated a criminology professor accused of research misconduct, Retraction Watch has learned, capping a years-long, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-criminologist-accused-of-cooking-the-books/">highly</a> <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/14/florida-state-university-under-fire-eric-stewart-a/">publicized</a> <a href="https://www.theflstandard.com/fsu-criminology-professor-abruptly-leaves-after-accusations-of-cooking-race-data/">saga</a> the school says has caused almost &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; damage to its standing.</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Final-Termination-Letter-7.13.23.pdf">termination letter</a> obtained by Retraction Watch, the university accused the former professor, Eric A. Stewart, of &#8220;extreme negligence and incompetence.&#8221; It also asserted that, due to Stewart’s actions, &#8220;decades of research&#8221; once believed &#8220;to be at the forefront of&#8221; criminology has &#8220;been shown to contain numerous erroneous and false narratives.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The details of problematic data management, false results, and the numerous publication retractions have negatively affected the discipline on a national level,&#8221; FSU Provost James J. Clark wrote in the letter, dated July 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clark added that the debacle had also affected recruitment of faculty and students and caused the university&#8217;s researchers to worry about their chances of getting papers into top journals.</p>



<span id="more-127564"></span>



<p>&#8220;The damage to the standing of the University and, in particular, the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice and its faculty approaches the catastrophic and may be unalterable,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>Stewart, whose work focuses on racial disparities in the criminal justice system, could not be reached for comments. He was hired by FSU in 2007.</p>



<p>The misconduct allegations date back to 2019, when one of Stewart&#8217;s coauthors, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/scj/faculty/justin-pickett">Justin Pickett</a>, suggested in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stewart-Data-7.23.19_Redacted.pdf">emails to the university</a> that Stewart had &#8220;falsified data and findings.&#8221; Pickett grew suspicious of his former collaborator following an email from a “John Smith” outlining problems with five of Stewart&#8217;s papers. A <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9b2k3/">27-page article</a> that Pickett posted to a preprint server later that year <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/07/17/criminologist-posts-27-page-article-explaining-why-he-asked-for-one-of-his-papers-to-be-retracted/">detailed his concerns</a> about <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00225.x">one of the studies</a>, as we reported at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the five papers, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/09/criminology-researcher-to-lose-sixth-paper/">along with a sixth</a>, have since been <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/11/19/criminologist-to-have-four-papers-retracted-following-months-of-scrutiny/">retracted</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to terminate Stewart, which he called &#8220;arbitrary and capricious&#8221; in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ERICST2.pdf">long response</a> (with an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ERICST2.pdf">appendix</a>) to FSU earlier this year, comes after years of bitter feuding. As revealed by dozens of internal documents obtained by Retraction Watch and made public here for the first time, the researcher vehemently defended himself against his critics. At one point he told colleagues in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ERICST2.pdf">an email</a> (p. 88) that &#8220;Justin Pickett has essentially lynched me and my academic character, thereby severely impacting my career, credibility, and professional advancement&#8221; &#8212; a particularly stinging charge, given that Stewart is Black.</p>



<p>On <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hello-Diana.pdf">another occasion</a>, Stewart claimed that the &#8220;baseless allegations&#8221; against him &#8220;serve as a means of harassment, as well as waste time and resources.&#8221;</p>



<p>To investigate, FSU conducted <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Final-Inquiry-Report.pdf">three</a> <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Final-Inquiry-Report-1.pdf">preliminary</a> <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Inquiry_Report_Final.pdf">probes</a> over as many years. While Stewart&#8217;s work contained several problems and statistical mistakes, the probes found no clear signs of research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inquiry committees all recommended against doing a full investigation, a decision that has drawn criticism from <a href="https://areomagazine.com/2020/02/20/how-universities-cover-up-scientific-fraud/">Pickett</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/14/florida-state-university-under-fire-eric-stewart-a/">others</a>. Pickett also argues that the university ignored its own conflict-of-interest rules by <a href="https://areomagazine.com/2020/02/20/how-universities-cover-up-scientific-fraud/">appointing two of Stewart&#8217;s coauthors to one of the inquiry committees</a>.</p>



<p>While the termination letter stops short of accusing Stewart of research fraud, it does point out that he has not been exonerated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The misconduct claims were not rejected, but in all inquiries into the matter, there was found to be insufficient evidence to support a full investigation into research misconduct which is defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Reached for comments, Amy Farnum-Patronis, director of News and Digital Communications at FSU, said: &#8220;The termination letter speaks for itself. We have nothing to add.&#8221;</p>



<p>One problem facing the inquiry committees was that Stewart&#8217;s raw data had gone missing. Allegedly, he handed over three data files to the university in July 2019. But the school since lost the files, as one of its lawyers explained in an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ERICST2.pdf">email this year</a> (p. 90ff) to the U.S. National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General, which investigates grant fraud.</p>



<p>However, Stewart later admitted that he had not handed over the raw data to the university as he <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Eric-Stewart-FSU-Response-Document-FINAL_marked_Redacted.pdf">had not been asked to do so</a> (p. 28)</p>



<p>In addition, the hard drive on which Stewart kept his data crashed in December 2019, he explained in an <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-Peer-Panel-Documents-Stewart_Redacted.pdf">investigatory interview last year</a> (p. 96ff). He had no backup, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;A data file that is &#8216;lost&#8217; while it is under investigation is particularly peculiar,&#8221; Thomas G. Blomberg, dean of the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at FSU, wrote in a series of <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-Peer-Panel-Documents-Stewart_Redacted.pdf">comments on Stewart&#8217;s statements</a> (p. 110ff). &#8220;Three outcomes are potentially possible. First, the data could have been lost (least likely explanation). Second, the data may have never existed. Third, the data existed in some format but were destroyed to prevent others from accessing them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Blomberg, who did not respond to a request for comment, also questioned what Stewart described as his &#8220;pretty extensive&#8221; training in statistics:</p>



<p><em>If his training in statistical analysis was extensive, then there is no way that he would have created the errors that he did in his studies. Calculating the standard deviation, for example, is something that is taught in middle and high schools and yet he repeatedly miscalculated and/or misreported the standard deviation.</em></p>



<p>In an overview of Stewart&#8217;s research, Blomberg <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/All-Peer-Panel-Documents-Stewart_Redacted.pdf">listed 16 studies</a> (p. 106) published over 17 years that all had indicators of &#8220;impossible results and erroneous statistics&#8221;:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These were no errors that could be explained away by human error or analytical decisions as they were detected across multiple studies using different data and that employed a variety of methodological and statistical approaches. In short, the problematic indicators were found to be pervasive in his studies, were not confined to just a single problematic indicator, and were detected across a lengthy stretch of his academic career providing compelling documentation of flagrant research incompetence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some of these studies are linked to federal grants, according to <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Inquiry_Report_Final.pdf">one of the inquiry reports</a>. That probe concluded that, based on available evidence, &#8220;there is little reason to believe the anomalous [standard deviations] are due to research misconduct as opposed to honest error.&#8221;</p>



<p>In March, after Stewart received a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stewart-Intent-to-Terminate-JC2-3-10-2023.pdf">letter describing the university&#8217;s intent to terminate him</a> and he was put on administrative leave, he requested that his case be reviewed by a university peer panel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the three members of that panel, only <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Stewart-Letter-Marks.pdf">one supported his termination</a>. Another <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Peer-Panel-Review-on-Dr.-Eric-Stewart-By-Sobanjo.pdf">recommended less severe punishment</a>, while the <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Salazar-Letter_Stewart-Case43.pdf">third found disciplinary action unwarranted</a>.</p>



<p>In the termination letter, Clark said Stewart had &#8220;distorted some important facts&#8221; in the information he had shared with the panel, which could have swayed some members in his favor.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Clark wrote, &#8220;I do not see how you can teach our students to be ethical researchers or how the results of future research projects conducted by you could be deemed as trustworthy. Therefore, I am proceeding with a termination.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newton-gravitational-constant-physics">Centuries on, Newton’s gravitational constant still can’t be pinned down</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">There was a secret inside the envelope in the hands of Stephan Schlamminger, one of the world’s leading experts in experimental tests of gravity. He appeared to be on the verge of opening the envelope during a presentation at the April 2022 meeting of the American Physical Society, to read a number that would reveal whether his latest efforts in a lifelong passion had been a success.</p>



<p>Schlamminger, of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., sought to <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR22/Session/S16.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure Newton’s gravitational constant</a>. The secret number in the envelope was a kind of code — an intentional and specific error inserted into his NIST experiment to obscure the measurement as it progressed. Only one person knew the number. And that person was not Schlamminger.</p>

<p>Without access to it, he couldn’t know what the experiment had found. Schlamminger had imposed the secrecy on himself to protect against bias in the experiment, including the unconscious bias that can beset even the best experimentalists. It was extra precaution to ensure the integrity of an experiment that could help untangle mysterious discrepancies in measurements of the constant, known as G, that have crept up over the last few decades.</p>



<p>G, often called “big G” (to distinguish it from “g,” which depends on G and is the special case of the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth), reflects the strength of gravity between any things with mass. It determines the orbits of planets and galaxies, and describes the force that pulls you to the ground. Nobody knows how to predict from theory what the actual value of G should be, says Clive Speake, a physicist at the University of Birmingham in England who developed the instrument that Schlamminger is using at NIST.</p>





<p>It’s also very difficult to measure. After two centuries of improved precision, recent measurements of G are troubling. A handful of labs around the world have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/explanation-gs-imprecision-stumbles">turned up values that disagree</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/30/15</em>). The scattered values could be a sign of trouble with the measurement techniques among various groups, or there might be a more intriguing aspect.</p>



<p>“There’s this haunting elephant in the room which suggests that maybe there’s something going on that we don’t understand,” Speake says. “If the measurements are right, then it could be the greatest discovery since Newton.”</p>



<p>Like so many science presentations in the time of COVID-19, Schlamminger’s reveal was set to be virtual. Presumably other physicists and science reporters around the world were, like me, hunched over screens waiting to see what the secret number would tell us about G.</p>



<p>The time had come to tear open the envelope. But the video feed stopped. The big reveal had been canceled. Puzzling discrepancies in the measurements meant the numbers could not be trusted. The envelope would remain sealed for at least another year as Schlamminger went back to the lab to take another shot at one of the most challenging measurements in physics.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is Newton’s gravitational constant?</h4>



<p>Newton’s gravitational constant is a misnomer. Though Isaac Newton developed his theory of gravity in the 17th century, he didn’t think in terms of G. He was primarily interested in how the force moved objects. Apples falling, planets in orbit and the surprisingly squashed shape of the Earth are just a few of the countless phenomena that Newton’s theory explained, all without explicitly mentioning G. The constant, named for Newton two centuries later, was instead wrapped into the masses involved.</p>



<p>We now know that Newton’s theory is only an approximation of Einstein’s more encompassing version of gravity, the general theory of relativity. It took Einstein’s theory to explain the intense gravity of black holes and the warping of space and time. Still, back here on Earth, it’s Newton’s theory of gravity that concerns Schlamminger and others wanting to measure G.</p>



<p>The force of gravity depends on three factors: the masses involved, the distances between the masses and G. While the masses and distances differ depending on whether you’re considering the forces between you and the Earth, for example, or a planet orbiting the sun, G is always the same. Along with the masses of elementary particles, the charge on an electron and the speed of light, G is one of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/units-measure-are-getting-fundamental-upgrade">dozens of constants crucial to science today</a> (<em>SN: 11/12/16, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>G, though, stands out from the rest. It’s one of the oldest recorded constants — only the speed of light was measured earlier. Yet despite hundreds of elegant experiments since British physicist Henry Cavendish first measured it 225 years ago, G remains among the least precisely known of the fundamental constants.</p>



<p>And in a way, our understanding of G has only worsened in recent decades as new, incompatible measurements have come in.</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Recent measurements of big G don’t agree</h4>



<p>When Cavendish performed his first measurements of the force of gravity in a lab, he relied on a set of lead spheres. Two of them were hanging at either end of a rod 6 feet (about 2 meters) long, and the whole contraption was dangled from a wire. He then placed larger lead balls nearby and measured the forces between the spheres by tracking how the hanging rod twisted on the wire. Although Cavendish was primarily interested in figuring out the Earth’s density, a little manipulation of his results shows that he effectively measured G for the first time. He got a value about 1 percent higher than today’s generally accepted value.</p>



<p>Many of the modern-day G experiments are refined versions of Cavendish’s setup. That includes the one Schlamminger uses. Instead of lead spheres, Schlamminger’s system has precisely machined copper cylinders. Four 1.2-kilogram cylinders, known as test masses, rest on a disk that hangs from a metallic ribbon. The gravitational attraction between the suspended cylinders and four larger, roughly 11-kilogram copper cylinders nearby causes the disk to rotate on the ribbon. Schlamminger calls the heavy cylinders source masses. He’s also done the experiment with a set of source masses made of sapphire crystal to see if G depends on the materials involved (it shouldn’t). Where Cavendish used a large wooden box to protect his apparatus from stray breezes, Schlamminger relies on a vacuum chamber to eliminate the air almost entirely.</p>



<p>Conceptually, the experiment running at NIST is the same as the one Cavendish used. But modern experiments offer much higher precision.</p>



<p>Cavendish’s experiments returned a value of 6.74 x 10<sup>-11</sup> cubic meters per kilogram-second squared. The number is correct to about one part in 100. These days, the accepted value is 6.67430 x 10<sup>-11</sup> with an uncertainty of about a part in 50,000, which means an error of plus or minus 0.00002 x 10<sup>-11</sup>. Some experiments have reached similar precision by relying on pendulums swinging near heavy masses instead of twisting wires.</p>



<p>But as precision increased, a new problem came along. Measurements over the last 20 years from various groups don’t agree. It’s as if G is slightly different in different places and at different times in a way that experimental error can’t account for. Schlamminger’s apparatus is on loan to NIST from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, or BIPM, in Sèvres, France, where researchers came up with a value of 6.67554 x 10<sup>-11</sup>, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/notorious-big-g-gets-little-larger">clear deviance from the accepted value</a> (<em>SN Online: 9/12/13</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The original G test</h3>



<p>Many modern tests of G are based on Henry Cavendish’s original torsion balance design (shown), developed more than two centuries ago. Cavendish hung two small lead spheres at either end of a long rod that was also hanging from a wire. He placed larger lead spheres nearby (inset). How the hanging rod twisted on its wire revealed the force of attraction between the smaller and larger lead spheres. Instead of lead spheres, an ongoing experiment at NIST uses copper cylinders.</p>

<p>The most likely reason for the discrepancies is that there’s something about each experimental system that’s unique. Researchers are keen to track down these sorts of systematic errors. But measuring gravity is tough, both because it’s the weakest of the fundamental forces (gravity is so weak that some modern experiments use tons of material to home in on G) and because everything with mass has gravity. There’s no way to shield the experiments from other sources of gravity, so researchers must attempt to account for the outside influences.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the discrepancies in G could have something to do with where the experiments are taking place. Perhaps the value of G in Sèvres really is 0.04 percent higher than the value of G recently measured in Boulder, Colo., for example. None of the experts contacted for this story think that’s a likely scenario. But in borrowing the BIPM gravity experiment and moving it to NIST’s campus in Maryland, Schlamminger’s efforts should help confirm that G doesn’t vary from place to place. That’s assuming he can work out whatever threw a wrench in his April 2022 reveal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why do we care about the precision of big G?</h4>



<p>Why do scientists need to measure G to perpetually higher precision anyway?</p>



<p>According to some experts, they don’t. “From a practical point of view, there isn’t a huge benefit to be derived from knowing G better,” says physicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville. Other constants, like the charge on an electron and the speed of light, “play a huge role in all kinds of important technology, whereas G doesn’t, because gravity is so darn weak,” Will says. “By the time gravity matters, on scales ranging from planets to the universe, what matters is G times mass.”</p>



<p>Physicist Claudia de Rham of Imperial College London has a different view. “G governs the strength of the gravitational force. In Newtonian gravity, it tells us how two massive bodies are gravitationally attracted to one another, but in Einstein’s theory of general relativity, this constant communicates how anything in our universe curves the fabric of spacetime.” Getting a better handle on G, she says, might help explain why gravity is so much weaker than electromagnetic forces or the strong nuclear force, which holds the parts of atoms together.</p>



<p>Although general relativity has proved to be one of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">most successful and revolutionary theories in history</a>, de Rham points out that its description of gravity may not be complete (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 16</em>). “Testing G to higher precision allows us to understand how constant and universal G really is and if there couldn’t be something else beyond Einstein’s theory of general relativity,” de Rham says.</p>



<p>Some researchers speculate that precise measures of G might one day help uncover the solution to one of the deepest mysteries in science: Why doesn’t gravity fit in with quantum physics? The standard model of particle physics is a quantum theory that describes just about everything in the universe, except gravity. Understanding G better, de Rham says, might lead to a quantum version of gravity, which is necessary to blend gravity into the standard model. Such a “theory of everything” has been a dream of physicists since at least Einstein.</p>



<p>For Schlamminger, the motivation is multi­faceted. “It’s mostly pure curiosity. And right now, there’s salt in the wounds that the agreement [between experimental groups] is so bad.” The thrill of pushing an extraordinarily difficult experiment just a bit further drives him too. “Why do people climb Mount Everest?” Schlamminger says. “Because it’s there.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other approaches to measuring big G</h4>



<p>One perennial challenge with Cavendish-style experiments is the wires. To interpret what’s going on with G, researchers have to know how the suspending wires respond to twisting or swaying, and how they change as they age.</p>



<p>Some researchers choose to do away with the pesky wires altogether, instead dropping or tossing things to see how they respond to the pull of nearby masses. The most precise versions of those experiments so far toss supercooled clouds of atoms up in a tower and then allow them to fall back down again. By doing the tossing with various configurations of heavy objects nearby, researchers can see how the gravitational force exerted by those objects affects the atoms’ trajectories. So far, the experiments have come up short of the most precise suspended-mass experiments by a factor of around 10, achieving a precision of one part in 5,000.</p>



<p>A recent experiment designed with other purposes in mind also dispensed with wires. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA, Pathfinder mission was a proof-of-principle test for a different type of gravity experiment. It was designed to show that it’s possible to precisely measure the distance between objects in space — key to building a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/lisa-pathfinder-pave-way-gravitational-wave-detection">space-based gravitational wave detector</a> (<em>SN Online 12/3/15</em>).</p>



<p>LISA Pathfinder managed to measure the distance between objects well enough to find G to within about one part in 15. That’s crude compared with Cavendish’s precision of one in 100, and much worse than other modern measurements. But it shows that an experiment in space, free of the complication of wires and nearby massive objects like the Earth, has potential to measure G in an entirely new way.</p>

This proof of concept suggests G can be measured without the interference of Earth’s gravity.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129750">ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another shortcoming of Cavendish-like experiments is that they measure forces between objects that are either moving slowly or standing completely still. These experiments can’t say much about whether G stays constant when things are moving quickly.</p>



<p>In experiments deep inside a mountain in Switzerland, mechanical engineering researcher Jürg Dual of ETH Zurich is replacing static masses with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-strength-big-g-newton-gravitational-constant">vibrating beams or rods rotating</a> like helicopter blades (<em>SN Online: 7/11/22</em>). The motions result in changes in distance between the moving parts and a beam that acts as a detector, which in turn changes the gravitational forces the detector beam feels. The detector beam vibrates like a tuning fork, and the size of those vibrations offers a measure of G.</p>



<p>Unlike conventional experiments, this one could detect whether G depends on motion, which “might be something quite spectacular actually,” Dual says. As for how likely that is, “I’m completely open,” he says.</p>



<p>For now, though, Schlamminger and others using hanging masses much as Cavendish did 225 years ago are still providing the most precise measurements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There’s no clear answer yet</h4>



<p>Schlamminger’s lab on the NIST campus is well below his office. “It’s about four stories underground,” he says. “There is less vibration, it’s easier to stabilize the temperature and the lab floor does not tilt as much. Usually buildings tilt with varying wind load. That is not a problem underground.”</p>



<p>On my visit to NIST a month after the canceled reveal, we head down several flights of stairs and take a walk through a vacant hall before entering a room that has a sticky mat just inside. It’s there to clean dust from your shoes as you go in. Even so, Schlamminger switches to a dedicated pair of shoes he stashes in the lab and gives me covers to slip over the soles of my shoes. Then we pass through another, airtight door to see the gravity experiment on loan to NIST. Things must be tidy when you’re trying to do something as difficult as measuring G.</p>



<p>Dust interfering with the tips of measurement probes could throw off readings of the positions of the cylinders. “A second concern, albeit smaller,” Schlamminger says, “is that dust settling on the source masses will change their mass.”</p>



<p>The G experiment is smaller than Cavendish’s pioneering design. You could fit it on a modest dining table. Here, it sits on a massive slab that minimizes the vibrations that manage to make it down to the lab. The vacuum chamber hides some of the moving parts of the apparatus from view.</p>



<p>Schlamminger is between runs at the moment, but four copper source masses, each about the diameter of a 2-liter soda bottle, are at the ready for the next G measurement. The source masses ride on a carousel outside the vacuum chamber, while the test masses sit on the disk suspended inside the chamber.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="636" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1.jpg" alt="A photo of lab equipment from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to study the gravitational constant." class="wp-image-3129746" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-620x383.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-729x450.jpg 729w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-301x186.jpg 301w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-768x474.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071523_gravity_inline1-939x580.jpg 939w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129746">In a lab at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, scientists are using an updated version (shown) of a centuries-old experiment to try to determine the precise value of Newton’s gravitational constant.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129746">JENNIFER LAUREN LEE/NIST</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the experimental mode that most closely mimics Cavendish’s experiment, tracking the rotation of the disk as it twists on the suspending ribbon offers a measure of the force between the source and test masses, revealing G. In another mode, Schlamminger determines G by finding the force it takes to prevent the disk from rotating.</p>



<p>A set of sapphire crystal source masses that are the same size as the copper ones are in a case nearby. They can take the place of the copper ones on the carousel to confirm that G is a true constant that doesn’t depend on the materials involved. At roughly twice the mass of the sapphire cylinders, the copper versions provide a better measure of G. Precisely how much each of the source masses weigh, though, Schlamminger doesn’t know. That’s because of the secret number tucked away in the sealed envelope.</p>



<p>“The big M, which is the masses of my big copper masses,” he says, “I have basically asked this mass group at NIST who has measured them to add a random factor.” Any studies he makes of G will be slightly off due to the random factor added to the true masses. Just how far off the measurement is won’t be clear until he opens the envelope. So why didn’t he open it in April 2022?</p>



<p>“I measured big G for like three months solid,” Schlamminger says, before popping open the vacuum chamber to check the placement of the cylinders. “Then I did another big G run, and the number was different. And that’s why I did not open the envelope, because I figured there’s something that I don’t understand.”</p>



<p>It turns out he had prerecorded his talk and expected to reveal the answer in real time at the meeting. He changed his mind before the presentation streamed, which is why the audience was left wondering.</p>



<p>There are hints that changes in the quality of the vacuum that come with opening and closing the experimental chamber are related to the measurement shifts. It’s another factor that Schlamminger says researchers will have to keep in mind if they’re to understand the discrepancies in measurements of Newton’s gravitational constant. </p>



<p>These days, Schlamminger is back at it with <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/B14.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another experimental run</a>. But one year on, at the 2023 American Physical Society meeting in Minneapolis, he still wasn’t ready to open the envelope. “I’m very, very careful with it because you can’t unopen the envelope.”</p>

<p>The editor in chief of a Wiley journal has resigned, saying the publisher recently has “seemed to emphasize cost-cutting and margins over good editorial practice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the journal’s associate editors are in the midst of a work stoppage protesting the same issues. After Wiley responded to the associate editors in a way they found “troubling,” the editors <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/07/14/betterpublishing-jbiogeography-i/">replied</a> with a list of 12 demands, and a deputy editor in chief tendered her resignation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Editorial boards of at least three other journals have recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/editors-of-public-health-journal-resign-over-differences-with-publisher/">resigned</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/26/editors-in-chief-of-aging-journal-resign-en-masse-after-impasse-with-the-anatomical-society-and-wiley/">en masse</a>, or <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/second-elsevier-journal-board-threatens-mass-resignations">threatened to resign</a>, amid similar disputes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MNDlab/status/1671563509593939968">Michael Dawson</a>, editor in chief of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652699"><em>Journal of Biogeography</em></a>, published a <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/06/21/chiefeditor-resign-jbiogeography/">blog post</a> announcing his resignation on June 21. In it, he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127548"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is becoming increasingly hard to stave off the undesirable consequences of the primary motivations of the the for-profit scientific publishing industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He listed several concerns from his resignation letter, including proposed growth targets, equity issues in adopting an open access model in which authors pay fees to publish their work, and compensation for the editors. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In trying to initiate discussions with Wiley about these issues, and being rebuffed multiple times, I came to the conclusion that the opportunities for improvement at the journal that appeared available until late-2022, had receded. What Wiley has failed to understand is that our interests are their interests. These issues seemed symptomatic of larger problems with the for-profit scientific publishing industry. I concluded I could do more by leaving than by staying.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In mid-October of 2022, Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">paused</a> the publication of special issues for Hindawi, the open access publisher it acquired in 2021, because of quality issues. The pause ended in January and cost the company $9 million in lost revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">About a week after Dawson’s resignation, another <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/06/29/associateeditors-workstoppage-jbiogeography/">blog post</a> announced the work stoppage by about 85% of the journal’s associate editors, citing “an unresolved dispute” with Wiley. The editors said they would continue to work on manuscripts under review or being revised, but would not take on work for new submissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors’ letter to Wiley, reproduced in the blog post, detailed three issues that triggered their protest: opposition to switching the journal to a full open access model, a proposed increase to the journal’s output, and automatic referral of rejected manuscripts to other Wiley journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They proposed a deadline of July 31 to reach a compromise with the publisher, and indicated they would be willing to resume working or resign their positions, depending on the outcome. The editors’ letter to Wiley concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please note that as Associate Editors, we work without any remuneration or compensation, and our ultimate goal is to advance the field of biogeography by supporting high-quality, peer-reviewed, cutting-edge research. The Journal of Biogeography has a proud history as a thought leader in our discipline, and we are firmly against any development of a business model that maximises profit but places in jeopardy the academic quality of the Journal of Biogeography.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The same day as the associate editors announced their work stoppage in the blog post, Ceridwen Fraser, a deputy editor in chief, tweeted that she had resigned over Wiley’s response to the editors’ concerns:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have also just tendered my resignation (with 6mo notice) as Deputy Editor in Chief of the Journal of Biogeography, following a response letter from Wiley to the AEs. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BetterPublishing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BetterPublishing</a> <br><br>As I state in my resignation letter: <a href="https://t.co/XyKR8dgjCE">pic.twitter.com/XyKR8dgjCE</a></p>&mdash; Ceridwen Fraser (@CeridwenFraser) <a href="https://twitter.com/CeridwenFraser/status/1674533366727843840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Fraser told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>My resignation was spurred after a year or so of back-and-forth with Wiley over their efforts to increase revenue – without increasing investment and at the cost of the quality and equity of what our journal publishes.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one of those emails, Fraser wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is disheartening to feel that our efforts are sometimes not fully appreciated by Wiley, when we all certainly put in more time than we are compensated for, and do it for the greater good of science communication – it seems that Wiley’s focus is increasingly on profit over quality / equity. I read some of Wiley’s recent shareholder reports and they were very depressing, lauding monstrous revenues while reassuring shareholders that all efforts are being made to further increase profits and reduce costs through trimming manpower and services, and growing outputs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another email, she wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The response letter shows that Wiley is remaining defensive and non-transparent on a number of issues. For example, we have had a quite strong indication in meetings with you and others from Wiley that the intention has been to shift more towards OA funded by APC or transformational agreements – and in those discussions, we asked lots of questions about equity issues related to OA that were not well answered – yet this letter makes it sound like our concerns about that have come from nowhere. Furthermore, the letter does not reference our concerns about exploitation of authors (inexplicably high OA charges that don’t seem to relate to the level of service provided), reviewers (no recompense), Associate Editors (no recompense), or even senior editors (honoraria that do not fully match the time investment or expertise required) by a company that continues to make impressive profits from our labour.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The associate editors replied to Wiley in a <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/07/14/betterpublishing-jbiogeography-i/">blog post</a> last week that disputed claims the editors said the publisher made in its response, such as there being no plans to make the journal fully open access, and that Wiley greatly values the work of the associate editors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors listed 12 “actions needed to resolve the current dispute.” These points included reducing the journal’s open access fees and offering waivers for authors who cannot afford to pay, increased investment from Wiley in the journal and biogeography research community, reversing cuts to editors’ honoraria and rewards, and removing nondisclosure clauses from editorial contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The blog post concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It will be particularly important for Wiley to show its re-investment in the journal, in the biogeography community, and in the future; to demonstrate that Wiley actually does respect editors, reinvest in the journal, and is committed to equitable access. All of which is currently unapparent. Such will reassure the community that JBI (and Wiley in general) is a reliable partner for our work and service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson sent us the following comment:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We were disappointed to receive the work stoppage notice for the Journal of Biogeography and that our response did not fully mitigate the editors’ concerns. We appreciate the concerns shared by members of the editorial team and acknowledge that there are not always perfect solutions. We thank all of the editors for their work and are looking at ways to better invest in the journal and the communities it serves. We are working on plans for the future of the journal and our priority is to continue delivering research that serves the biogeography community.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">What’s causing this summer’s extreme heat waves?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dog days of summer are upon us. Brutal heat waves are roasting regions around the globe, smashing records with unrelenting severity.</p>



<p>In the southwest United States and northern Mexico, devastating heat has been scorching the region for weeks. For 19 straight days and counting, temperatures in Phoenix have reached above 43.3° Celsius (110° Fahrenheit), surpassing a record streak from 1974. The Texas city of El Paso has endured an unprecedented 33 consecutive days of temperatures reaching over 37.8° C (100° F), and that streak is only expected to continue. And just after midnight on July 17, Death Valley, Calif., may have sweltered under the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere for that time: 48.9° C (120° F).</p>





<p>China has also been enduring extreme heat for weeks. On July 16, the township of Sanbao broke not only the national record with a temperature of 52.2° C (126° F), but also the record for highest temperature above 40˚ N latitude. Meanwhile, southern Europe is in its second heat wave in a week, with Rome recording a new all-time high of 42.9° C (109.2° F) on July 18 while a town in Catalonia, Spain set a new record for the region, 45.3° C (113.5° F).</p>



<p>What’s concocting these bouts of extreme heat? It’s partly because the world has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-record-june-july-water-climate">exceptionally warm</a> this year, thanks to the compounding of human-caused climate change with a natural climate phenomenon called El Niño, whose influence is known to temporarily warm our planet (<em>SN: 7/13/23</em>).</p>



<p>But it’s not just that Earth’s a hotter stovetop; the cooks have been busy. The jet streams, powerful ribbons of wind that control much of the planet’s weather, have been meandering and getting stuck, holding bulges of hot air over many parts of the Earth. While that’s not unusual, some scientists have suggested that climate change may be altering the dynamics of the consequential winds.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we know about how climate change is impacting extreme heat and how these potentially dangerous events occur.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Extreme heat waves are becoming more likely</h4>



<p>Let’s start with that hot stovetop. Humans have been warming the planet for decades by emitting climate-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That’s made extreme heat waves more common, many researchers say.</p>



<p>Since 2004, scientists have conducted <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attribution studies</a> to estimate how much climate change may have influenced the probability and severity of a specific bout of extreme weather. These studies essentially simulate the world with and without climate change to compare how often certain types of extreme weather events occur.</p>



<p>The work of the <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Weather Attribution initiative</a> has repeatedly indicated that climate change has made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-storms-deadly-africa-early-2022">extreme weather</a> events like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">heat waves</a> more likely and more severe (<em>SN: 4/11/22</em>; <em>SN: 7/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>A May report concluded that an <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-humid-heat-in-south-asia-in-april-2023-largely-driven-by-climate-change-detrimental-to-vulnerable-and-disadvantaged-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April heat wave in South Asia</a> — during which locations in Thailand and Laos set new national temperature records of 45.4° C and 42.9° C, respectively — was made at least 30 times more likely due to climate change.</p>



<p>Another study suggested that a different heat wave in northern Africa and southwestern Europe, which subjected some areas to temperatures <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-april-heat-in-spain-portugal-morocco-algeria-almost-impossible-without-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 degrees C higher than is normal</a> in April, was at least 100 times more likely due to climate change.</p>





<p>Climate change is pushing heat waves in general to have higher temperatures, but it’s having a particularly strong impact on the frequency of the most extreme events, says atmospheric scientist Noboru Nakamura of the University of Chicago.</p>



<p>“What used to be once every 1,000 years might now occur every 20 years,” he says. “It’s still a rare event, but … you can actually feel that in our daily lives.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How heat waves form</h4>



<p>What’s actually whipping up these summer scorchers, and why are only certain regions getting roasted?</p>



<p>The answer lies roughly 8 to 14 kilometers high in the sky. There, the jet streams flow at about 177 kilometers per hour on average, though they can reach speeds of more than 400 kilometers per hour — faster than a Shinkansen bullet train.</p>



<p>These powerful winds control much of Earth’s weather by transporting high- and low-pressure systems around the world.</p>



<p>Jet streams develop where large masses of air with different temperatures meet, flowing faster where the temperature contrast is stronger. When jet streams are blowing strong, they tend to orient themselves more parallel to the equator, says atmospheric scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Mass. “But when those winds get weaker … then we tend to see the jet stream take these bigger meanders.”</p>



<p>When the jet stream meanders, it forms broad waves, with crests and troughs that reach north and south for hundreds of kilometers. Jet streams in the northern and southern hemispheres typically undulate more during their respective summers. Due to Earth’s axial tilt, polar regions receive more warming sunlight during their summers, weakening their temperature contrast with the tropics. As the waves become amplified, high- and low-pressure systems in the crests and troughs encroach farther north and south. Sometimes these pressure systems become stuck over one spot for days to weeks, causing weather to persist over a region.</p>



<p>When a high-pressure system gets stuck over an area, it pushes air down toward the surface, compressing and warming the air. The high pressure also pushes clouds away, clearing the sky for the hot sun to beat down unabated. These factors compound to produce a heat dome, a phenomenon that scorches and often dries landscapes.</p>

<p>An exception is when heat domes form by coastlines — such as the one that has formed by the U.S. Gulf Coast. Since warmer air can carry more moisture, heat domes near the ocean can make for weather that is both hot and humid, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">potentially lethal combination</a> for humans (<em>SN: 7/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>It’s a bit of a mystery why pressure systems become stuck, Nakamura says, making the phenomenon difficult to predict. It may occur when jet streams become especially wavy, he and a colleague reported in 2018 in <em>Science</em>. The waves may get stuck like cars in a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat0721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traffic jam</a>, causing weather to idle in place.</p>



<p>But this explanation is a theoretical one, and more evidence is needed to validate it, Nakamura says. Until then, he says, the underlying mechanics of those jams will remain elusive.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The jet streams’ uncertain future</h4>



<p>A related, but similarly unresolved, problem is how climate change may affect the dance of the jet streams in the future. In 2012, Francis and a colleague proposed climate change could <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make the powerful winds more wobbly</a>.</p>



<p>“The Arctic is warming about four times faster than the globe as a whole,” Francis says. “That means that the north-south temperature difference has been getting weaker and weaker.” As a result, jet streams may be becoming more unstable, she says, and more prone to meandering.</p>



<p>But that’s still “a very hotly contested hypothesis,” Nakamura says, pointing out that some climate simulations have suggested that in the Northern Hemisphere, the jet stream may actually become less wavy. “There is not a widely accepted consensus on this,” Nakamura says.</p>



<p>Even if the fate of the jet streams remains up in the air, one thing seems clear: Extreme heat waves aren’t going anywhere.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/open-science-is-better-science/">Open Science is better science</a></h4>

              
                <p>At the heart of the Open Science movement is the conviction that <strong><em>Open Science is better science</em></strong>. More rigorous. More inclusive. More efficient. More trustworthy. More reproducible. And more impactful for society.</p>



<p>The different aspects of Open Science practice&mdash;from open methods and data, to preprints, to ORCID and CRediT, to published peer review&mdash;are all part of a mutually reinforcing cycle. Each component works in tandem, and as adoption rises the benefits increase, spiraling ever outward, reshaping our research system and, ultimately, producing <strong><em>better science</em></strong>.</p>



<p>At PLOS, our mission is to lead that transformation. We believe we can best accomplish that by empowering researchers to engage in fundamental Open Science practices on a large scale, by:</p>



<ol><li>Offering Open Science options that serve researchers&rsquo; goals and priorities, as well as those of the public, and</li><li>Removing barriers and expanding access to Open Science to all researchers.</li></ol>



<p>So far, it has worked. PLOS helped to demonstrate the feasibility of Open Access journals beginning in 2003 with <em>PLOS Biology</em>, and put Open Access within reach for more researchers than ever before with <em>PLOS ONE</em> in 2009. Our pioneering 2014 data availability policy has reset the standards for data sharing industry-wide. Our streamlined and collaborative approach to preprints reduces the administrative burden on researchers, normalizes early sharing, and increases access to new science.</p>



<p>This work continues today, through key projects designed to better understand researcher needs, incentivize Open behaviors to improve research quality and reliability, and increase access to Open publishing options. Read on for a short summary of some of our current efforts.</p>



<h2>Open Science Indicators (OSIs)</h2>



<p>In order to increase the prevalence of Open Science practices, we need to be able to reliably measure Open Science practices. Until recently, there was no easy way to do so, other than having an expert review and assess individual articles. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-indicators-update-q1-2023/">Open Science Indicators (OSIs)</a> use Natural Language Processing to identify and quantify Open Science behaviors in the published literature, and to compare rates of generation and adoption across discipline, region, and other factors. This enables PLOS to better understand and meet researcher needs; by making the dataset publicly available, we hope to support efforts outside PLOS as well. Currently, the OSI dataset includes data sharing, code sharing and preprints. We aim to include additional indicators in the future.</p>



<h2>Accessible Data</h2>



<p>Readers rely on raw scientific data for understanding, verification, replication and reanalysis, and to inform future investigations, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. But researchers can only access and use data if they are aware it exists. PLOS&rsquo; Accessible Data feature is an experimental functionality which increases the visibility of data posted in select public repositories on PLOS article pages. By highlighting publicly available data in this way, we hope to facilitate access and reuse, save readers time searching for public data online, and learn from user behavior. After a successful first year, the Accessible Data functionality was recently expanded from the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">original three servers</a> to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">nine.</a></p>



<h2>Moving beyond APCs</h2>



<p>Article Processing Charges (APCs) have demonstrated that Open Access is viable, and allowed Open publishing to become a force in our industry. But APCs are also exclusionary and inequitable; burdensome for authors and time consuming for publishers to administer; and tend to create incentives that privilege volume over other considerations. At PLOS, we&rsquo;re moving beyond APCs to new funding models that distribute the costs of publication more fairly and reduce expenses for everyone involved, including <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">institutional agreements</a>. To date, we&rsquo;ve partnered with over 280 universities, libraries, and other institutions in 28 countries to help bring Open Science within reach for all.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/granite-moon-surface-volcanism">Granite likely lurks beneath the moon’s surface</a></h4>

              
                <p>Watch out Yosemite — the moon has its own impressive rock display.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06183-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enormous chunk of granite</a>, measuring roughly 50 kilometers wide, may be buried beneath the lunar surface, researchers reported July 5 in <em>Nature</em>. Finding such a behemoth, by far the largest granite structure spotted beyond Earth, is a surprise given that forming this type of rock typically requires plate tectonics or abundant water.</p>



<p>When Apollo astronauts landed on the moon in the 1960s and 1970s, they encountered vistas dominated by basalt. The igneous rock is run-of-the-mill stuff on both the moon and our planet, says Matthew Siegler, a planetary scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson. “Everything starts as basalt.”</p>





<p>But over time, with enough heat and pressure, basalt can melt and morph into more durable granite. Plate tectonics and water, both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">mainstays on Earth</a>, often help facilitate that transformation: Tectonic forces can help drag rocks down deep, where it’s hotter, and water, acting like a salt, helps rocks melt at lower temperatures (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>Because the moon has no plate tectonics and very little water, finding copious amounts of granite there would be unexpected, Siegler says. Indeed, out of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">roughly 380 kilograms of moon rocks</a> (about the heft of a large bear) brought back to Earth by Apollo astronauts, just a handful of millimeter-sized pieces are granite (<em>SN: 7/15/19</em>). “That’s our whole inventory,” Siegler says.</p>



<p>But Siegler and his colleagues now have strong evidence that a massive piece of granite might be lurking under the moon’s surface. The team analyzed microwave data collected from the farside of the moon by China’s Chang’e-1 and Chang’e-2 lunar orbiters and discovered a geothermal hotspot roughly 9 degrees Celsius warmer than expected. Elevated temperatures are often an indicator of granite, Siegler says, because uranium and thorium — radioactive elements that decay over time and release heat — tend to aggregate within the rock. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To estimate how large a piece of granite could be lying beneath the region, known as the Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex, the researchers ran computer simulations of different sizes of granite buried at different depths. The team concluded that an ellipsoidal hunk of granite roughly 50 kilometers wide and 25 kilometers tall capped by a smaller ellipsoid of granite, all buried four kilometers below the lunar surface, best explained the Chang’e-1 and Chang’e-2 observations.</p>



<p>The big question is how such an edifice formed. One idea that Siegler and his colleagues propose is that a mantle plume — a column of molten rock — once persisted under the Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex. That plume would have turned some of the region’s basalt into granite.</p>



<p>On Earth, mantle plumes famously combine with tectonic plate movement <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-volcanoes-share-split-personality">to create island chains like Hawaii</a>, Siegler says (<em>SN: 9/19/11</em>). But on the moon, where there is no plate tectonics, a mantle plume would just continuously heat one region, he says. “You get a single spot of the crust that keeps getting roasted.”</p>



<p>This is an intriguing discovery that should be followed up with a lunar mission, says Brad Jolliff, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved with the new study. “It’s ripe for a robotic mission that has a small rover that can test some of these properties up close.”</p>



<p>In the next few years, scientists plan to do just that. NASA’s Lunar Vulkan Imaging and Spectroscopy Explorer mission, or Lunar-VISE, which is slated to launch by 2027, will land on the summit of one of the <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/482/a-lunar-mystery-the-gruithuisen-domes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gruithuisen domes</a>. Located on the moon’s nearside, these volcanic features are believed to also contain granite. Lunar-VISE will be able to take a closeup look at the region’s chemical composition, says the mission’s principal investigator Kerri Donaldson Hanna, a planetary geologist at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.</p>



<p>That’s important because it’s often difficult to capture small details from orbit. Landers like Lunar-VISE can shed light on the moon’s geology, says Donaldson Hanna. “We need new observations.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milking-umbilical-cord-help-sick-newborns">‘Milking’ umbilical cords may help some sickly newborns</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giving birth to a child who is unresponsive or struggling to breathe is a harrowing experience. The medical team must quickly cut the umbilical cord and then rush the baby to aid. But taking a few seconds to squeeze blood from the cord into an infant’s abdomen before cutting the cord could help with the infant’s recovery, two recent studies suggest.</p>



<p>The practice, known as umbilical cord milking, is relatively unknown and not without some controversy. But if its promise holds up, it may help protect some of the most at-risk newborns, researchers say.</p>





<p>During fetal development, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/public-private-cord-blood-banks-caveats">the umbilical cord</a> brings nutrients from the placenta, which also serves as a reservoir for blood, iron and stem cells (<em>SN: 4/4/18</em>). At birth, the infant is still connected to this reservoir, and the <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2020/12/delayed-umbilical-cord-clamping-after-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard recommendation</a> is to wait at least 30 seconds to a minute before clipping that connection, allowing the baby to take in more of those essential nutrients.</p>



<p>Some studies suggest that for healthy babies, delayed cord clamping can improve some aspects of health, such as iron levels or fine motor skills, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6544813/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for months</a> or <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2296145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even years</a>.</p>



<p>For babies born with urgent health problems, however, there’s no time to wait. In these cases, quickly milking the cord might provide similar benefits as delayed cord clamping. But the jury is still out on if or when to use the technique. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, said that there is “insufficient evidence to support or refute umbilical cord milking” in its 2020 <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2020/12/delayed-umbilical-cord-clamping-after-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidelines</a>, which the group reaffirmed earlier this year.</p>



<p>In one of the new studies, researchers randomly assigned 10 medical centers in three countries to one of two groups. If an infant was born limp, with difficulty breathing or bluish skin, the cord was immediately clamped and cut in one group. In the other, the umbilical cord was milked four times before being cut. The hospitals then switched practices halfway through the study.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937822006494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzing outcomes for over 1,700 infants</a>, researchers found that babies who had had their umbilical cords milked were less likely to need extra oxygen or other breathing assistance. The newborns were also less likely to suffer from a brain injury called hypoxic encephalopathy that’s caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain before or shortly after birth, the team reported in the February <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>.</p>



<p>In a follow-up analysis of <a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(23)00179-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood flow in over 200 of the infants</a>, published in the June <em>Journal of Pediatrics</em>, the researchers found that these improved outcomes were probably due in part to increased blood volume and blood flow to the heart, lungs and brain in the infants who received the cord milking. These newborns also had slightly higher levels of hemoglobin, the protein which carries oxygen in human blood, than babies whose cords were quickly cut.</p>



<p>“We saw dramatic differences in the babies that have this extra blood,” says Anup Katheria, a neonatologist at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women &amp; Newborns in San Diego.</p>



<p>The new research adds key evidence in favor of umbilical cord milking, says Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in England who has collaborated with Katheria but wasn&#8217;t involved in the two studies. The findings offer important assurance to obstetricians who might be hesitant to adopt the practice, she says. “It should really be getting into standard of care.”</p>



<p>The intervention is quick, simple and does not require equipment, meaning it might be readily adopted in places with limited medical resources.</p>



<p>But the practice could harm some infants’ health. Another study lead by Katheria ended early in 2019 after it found that umbilical cord milking increased the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2755614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likelihood of brain bleeding</a> in very preterm infants, those born at less than 32 weeks of pregnancy.</p>





<p>Based on the recent studies, umbilical cord milking “shows promise” in infants born in poor health at or near term, says Sarah McDonald, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the studies. But more research is needed before the practice is recommended for use, even in emergency situations. And for most infants, she and Katheria agree, delayed cord clamping will likely remain the best course of action.</p>

<p>An engineering researcher has stepped down from an editorial board at the request of a journal’s leadership following a sleuth’s comment on a Retraction Watch post linking him to paper mill activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://research.iaun.ac.ir/pd/afrand/">Masoud Afrand</a>, an assistant professor of engineering at the Islamic Azad University in Iran, was, until recently, on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-analysis-with-boundary-elements/about/editorial-board">editorial board</a> of the journal <em>Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements</em>. He also was listed on the website of <em>Scientific Reports</em> as a member of the journal’s editorial board in the subject of mechanical engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He now has neither position. He has not responded to our requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127540"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In <a href="https://undark.org/2023/06/21/in-a-tipsters-note-a-view-of-science-publishings-achilles-heel/">our original story</a> with Undark, Alexander Magazinov, a scientific sleuth and software engineer based in Kazakhstan, said Afrand “was likely part of a paper mill operation for a special issue in <em>Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences</em>, where Afrand was cited over 130 times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magazinov had cited Afrand’s association with <em>Scientific Reports</em> as an example of researchers seemingly associated with paper mills attaining editorial roles with reputable journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following our reporting, <em>Scientific Reports</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/">removed Afrand</a> from the webpage with its editorial board members. Rafal Marszalek, its chief editor, told us that the journal had “parted ways” with Afrand in March 2022, after an internal audit uncovered “irregularities” in how he handled papers. Afrand had still been listed on the webpage “due to an oversight,” and the journal updated the page after our story brought attention to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#comment-2174179">separate comment</a>, he asked, “Why Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements hired Afrand as editor in March 2023?”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Earlier this week, Alexander Cheng, the editor in chief of <em>Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements</em>,” responded with a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/11/editorial-board-member-dropped-from-journal-site-after-retraction-watch-undark-report-links-him-to-paper-mill/#comment-2175490">comment</a> on the post, stating the journal had asked Afrand to resign due to the “serious accusation” of “unethical publication conduct.” The researcher “kindly agreed,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cheng’s comment elaborated on the findings of the journal’s investigation into Afrand’s citations and the work he did as a guest editor for a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-analysis-with-boundary-elements/special-issue/10QV09LJ40D">special issue</a> of the journal. “Scanning the first 10 papers” of the 56 in the special issue uncovered a “not out of the ordinary” number of citations of Afrand’s papers, Cheng said. Cheng also said he had monitored Afrand’s editorial work and “did not find any irregularities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cheng continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In conclusion, concerning Afrand’s editorial work for EABE, the special issue was not an effective way for him to boost his citations, particularly in view of his very high citation record. His editorial conduct has been honorable, and I find no fault in it. The journal regrets that due to the bad publicity, justified or unjustified, we have asked Afrand to step down. He gracefully agreed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an email to Retraction Watch, Cheng confirmed he had submitted the comment, and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As these are serious accusations and can destroy careers, we need to be careful in delivering the punishment to whom is due. I am neutral in the process. I only comment on the journal&#8217;s relation with Afrand.</p>

Others had received even more citations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rain-electrons-mercury-xray-auroras">A rain of electrons causes Mercury’s X-ray auroras</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mercury’s auroras are perfectly in character. While temperate Earth gets heavenly light shows over its poles, hellish Mercury gets invisible ribbons of X-ray radiation that cling to its sun-blasted surface.</p>



<p>But as alien as they may appear, Mercury’s X-ray auroras have a lot in common with Earth’s polar lights, and with auroras throughout the solar system.</p>



<p>Scientists have now directly shown that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39565-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fluctuations in Mercury’s magnetic field can fling electrons toward the planet</a>, where they eventually rain down and cause auroras of X-ray light. This process, called electron precipitation, now appears to be practically universal in the solar system: It causes auroras on every planet with a global magnetic field except Neptune, researchers report July 18 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Even Mars, which has only localized magnetic fields, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-aurora-high-altitude-dust-clouds-surprise-scientists">auroras caused by raining electrons</a> (<em>SN: 3/19/15</em>).</p>





<p>For Mercury, “this is really the first time to detect these electrons directly,” says space plasma physicist Sae Aizawa of the University of Pisa in Italy.</p>



<p>Electron precipitation usually happens because of interactions between planets’ magnetic fields and the solar wind — a stream of charged particles spewed from the sun’s upper atmosphere.</p>



<p>Buffeted by the solar wind, the sun-facing side of a planet’s magnetic field gets squished while the night side is swept out into a long “magnetotail” that extends behind the planet. Eventually, the magnetotail stretches so much that its formerly mostly-parallel magnetic field lines snap and reconnect, sending some field lines flying off behind the planet and others back toward it.<s></s></p>

<p>“The magnetic field lines sort of break and form new ones,” says space physicist Ryan Dewey of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved in the study. “And in that process, a lot of energy is released.”</p>



<p>All that energy sends packets of electrons flying planetward, spiraling in corkscrew-like trajectories along magnetic field lines. When these electrons hit the planet or its atmosphere, they release energy as light.</p>



<p>The light’s wavelength depends on what the electrons encounter as they rain down. Earth’s auroras shine in visible wavelengths because incoming electrons excite molecules of uncharged gases in the atmosphere like oxygen and nitrogen, which release visible light when they relax back to their normal states. Mercury’s auroras shine in X-ray wavelengths because electrons decelerate as they smack the planet’s rocky surface. The lost energy is released as X-rays.</p>



<p>Researchers first spotted <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012JE004118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercurian X-ray auroras</a> in data beamed back from the MESSENGER probe, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/messenger-mission-ends-crash-landing-mercury">orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/15</em>). But while scientists reasoned that electrons must rain down on Mercury to cause its X-ray glow, MESSENGER didn’t have the right instruments to measure the precipitating particles.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s BepiColombo spacecraft does. Analyzing data from the probe’s first flyby of Mercury in 2021, Aizawa and her colleagues spotted telltale signs of the process.</p>



<p>One clue was that as BepiColombo flew through Mercury’s magnetosphere, it observed surges of fast-moving, high-speed electrons followed by several subsequent waves of progressively slower, lower-energy electrons. “This is exactly what we’d describe as a precipitating signature,” says Aizawa, who did the work while at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France.</p>





<p>To Dewey, the new discovery is a tantalizing sneak peek at the discoveries waiting to be made at Mercury once BepiColombo enters orbit in 2025. By then, it will have been a decade since scientists last had a probe continuously orbiting Mercury.</p>



<p>“To me, it&#8217;s very exciting to see just how much we can learn from even just a short pass through the magnetosphere,” he says. “It’s a glimpse.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/oxygen-learning-stroke-recovery/">Pure Oxygen Speeds Up Learning. Can It Help Stroke Survivors Recover?</a></h4>

              
                Relearning everyday tasks is difficult for people with brain trauma. These researchers want to know if combining physical therapy with doses of oxygen will make the process easier.
