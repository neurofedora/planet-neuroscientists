<p>On March 7, a Sage journal published an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241239903">expression of concern</a> for an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241226566">article</a> on cases of myocarditis in people who had received a COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Editor and the publisher were alerted to potential issues with the research methodology and conclusions and author conflicts of interest” and had undertaken an investigation of the article, the notice stated. According to one of the authors, the investigation involved two new peer reviews of the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve reported on many cases of authors disagreeing with retractions other publishers issued after conducting post-publication review processes. The papers often involve hot-button issues – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/14/journal-pulls-pesticide-article-a-year-after-authors-engaged-lawyer-to-fight-retraction-decision/">pesticide poisoning</a>, the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/04/authors-file-complaint-with-publisher-as-journal-retracts-vaping-paper/">effect of vaping on smoking rates</a>, an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/01/how-an-article-estimating-deaths-from-hydroxychloroquine-use-came-to-be-retracted/">estimation of deaths from the use of hydroxychloroquine</a> early in the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/17/reddit-post-prompts-retraction-of-article-that-called-trump-the-main-driver-of-vaccine-misinformation-on-twitter/">President Trump’s role in spreading vaccine misinformation</a> on Twitter before the company suspended his account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131570"></span>



<p>The apparent necessity of post-publication peer review for some papers raises questions about how well publishers ensure the quality of the peer review process and editorial decision making, and how the companies respond to scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a world awash with flawed papers, which ones earn a post-publication review from a publisher? A spokesperson for Sage said a paper’s topic does not play a role in the decision to commission a post-publication review, but a sleuth argues it should.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The COVID-19 vaccine myocarditis article appeared in Sage’s <em>Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety</em> on January 27, 2024. It has been cited seven times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. In 2021, an earlier version of the article had been published briefly in an Elsevier journal, then <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/25/covid-19-vaccine-myocarditis-paper-to-be-permanently-removed-elsevier/">removed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://jessicar.substack.com/p/breaking-the-drama-is-not-over-for">blog post</a> from Jessica Rose, one of the authors of the paper, the two individuals who reviewed the published paper requested dozens of corrections. That appears to contrast with the two original reviewers, who “provided a single sentence review with no substance,” a Sage spokesperson told us. In her blog post, Rose said she and her coauthors had revised the paper “as per the reviewers’ helpful comments and suggestions” before it was published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not how the peer-review process works, at least, it never has been in the past,” Rose wrote in her post. “You cannot re-review an already accepted and published paper based on post-publication ‘complaints/whining/musings’ and expect the authors to re-write it to this degree (52 detailed points?!) after a year has passed.”</p>



<p>If the article had so many problems, they should have been addressed in the original peer review process, not a year after publication, Rose wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rose attributed <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C9EC1C8336F615B6BCA5C724932682">criticism</a> of her paper to “trolls,” and wondered “if this is an attempt to purge the paper once again from the eyes of the public.” Rose did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An internal managing editor “now assists in ensuring high standards of peer review are met” at the journal that published Rose’s paper, a Sage spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As scholarly processes aren’t perfect, like all publishers, we must continually refine our practices to make meaningful, long-term improvements,” the spokesperson said. “This means learning from cases like these and making process changes in response, giving guidance to editors while respecting editorial independence, and taking corrective action when necessary to preserve the integrity of the scientific record.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Other researchers have accused Sage of conducting post-publication peer reviews with a foregone conclusion: retracting their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last October, the authors of three papers about abortion that Sage <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/06/papers-used-by-judge-to-justify-abortion-pill-suspension-retracted/">retracted</a> after conducting post-publication peer review <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/04/authors-sue-sage-over-discriminatory-retractions-of-papers-cited-in-abortion-pill-case/">sued the publisher</a>, alleging the retractions were “discriminatory.” A federal judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-publisher-retracts-studies-cited-by-texas-judge-suspending-abortion-pills-2024-02-06/">cited two of the articles</a> in his 2023 decision to suspend approval of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation#:~:text=Mifepristone%20is%20a%20drug%20that,of%20the%20last%20menstrual%20period).">mifepristone</a>, a drug used in medical abortions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors sought to compel Sage to enter arbitration with them, and <a href="https://lozierinstitute.org/charlotte-lozier-institute-scholars-begin-arbitration-to-defend-science-against-publisher-retractions/">appear to have prevailed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their <a href="https://assaultonscience.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/2025.02.21-SvS-Arbitration-Demand_Redacted.pdf?__hstc=85124486.429de3af8435f67c7f605937018b7b53.1742913001887.1742913001887.1742999568665.2&amp;__hssc=85124486.1.1742999568665&amp;__hsfp=3604940382">demand for arbitration</a>, lawyers for the authors allege the post-publication review was “improper, unscientific, and performed with the express purpose of justifying retraction.” (The demand also refers to the lead author’s entries in The Retraction Watch Database, claiming other editors will find those and not want to publish his submissions.) The publishing agreement the authors signed with Sage did not authorize such a review, and Sage did not give the authors an opportunity to read and respond to the reviewers’ full comments before deciding to retract the articles, the authors allege.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage wanted to retract the articles because the publisher “did not want to provide a platform for researchers whom it perceived to be pro-life or advancing pro-life views or causes,” the authors allege. Sage “applied inconsistent retraction standards” to their work based on the publisher’s perception of them as pro-life, the authors argue, in violation of California’s anti-discrimination law.</p>



<p>In light of these recent, high-profile cases, we asked Sage a few questions about how the publisher handles post-publication peer review — not just an internal evaluation of concerns raised, but with additional reviewers recruited to assess an article in its entirety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage undertakes such reviews “when substantial concerns about the quality of an article are brought to our attention, the original review process did not meet our standards as outlined by the Committee on Publication Ethics, and if there are no concerns regarding fabrication of identities or indicators of paper mill activity,” a Sage spokesperson who declined to be named told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on those criteria for initiating a review, the number of papers to get such treatment varies each year, according to the spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage asks reviewers “to consider whether the methodology is appropriate, if the study is grounded in the literature, and if the conclusions are supported by the results,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The topics a paper addresses do not play a role in deciding to initiate a review, the spokesperson said. When we asked for an example of non-controversial papers that have received post-publication peer review, the spokesperson sent us a November 2023 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00207209231197937">retraction notice</a> for 90 papers from the <em>International Journal of Electrical Engineering &amp; Education</em>. The original peer review process for the articles did not meet Sage’s standards, according to the notice, and post-publication peer review “highlighted fundamental concerns within the articles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The volume of papers retracted from a single journal, plus the language of the notice, suggest paper mill activity, which would indicate a completely different category of apparently substandard peer review than the other recent cases. However, the Sage spokesperson said the publisher identified “a range of issues” in papers from the journal and re-reviewed those “with quality and peer review concerns that did not display indicators of paper mill activity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Heathers, a scientific sleuth, argues that a paper’s topic should play a role in the decision to conduct a post-publication review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The societal and scientific implications of any given paper vary wildly from &#8216;of absolutely no consequence whatsoever&#8217; to &#8216;an active threat to human life,&#8217;” he said. “Anyone treating both of those the same is waiving necessary editorial discretion and wasting resources!”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The <em>International Wound Journal </em>has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?field1=Title&amp;text1=Retraction&amp;publication%5B%5D=1742481x&amp;publication=&amp;Ppub=&amp;AfterMonth=1&amp;AfterYear=2025&amp;BeforeMonth=4&amp;BeforeYear=2025&amp;content=articlesChapters&amp;field1=Title&amp;target=default&amp;text1=Retraction">retracted 242 papers so far this year</a> as part of an ongoing investigation into manipulated peer review.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/03/wiley-medical-journal-retracts-dozens-of-paper-for-manipulated-peer-review-with-more-to-come/">reported in December</a> the journal, a Wiley title, had retracted 27 papers as part of an investigation. A Wiley spokesperson told us the 2025 retractions are part of the same ongoing investigation, and that the editors “anticipate additional retractions in the weeks to come.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the retraction notices list manipulated peer review and share similar text, like the notice from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70380">this retraction</a> of a 2023 paper:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131565"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following an investigation by the publisher, all parties have concluded that this article was accepted solely on the basis of a compromised peer review process. The editors have therefore decided to retract the article.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nearly 80 percent of the notices stated the authors did not respond to the notice regarding retraction, with 15 percent of authors disagreeing with the retraction.</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us for our last story the investigation started internally, but several of the retraction notices cited a “third party,” stating “It came to the publisher’s attention from a third party that a number of articles shared concerning similarities in format and structure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least 21 of the 2025 retractions <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70246">also credit</a> a “third party” that found “evidence of excessive self-citations” in the articles’ references. The Wiley spokesperson didn’t respond to our request for more information about who the third party might refer to.</p>



<p>The journal became open access in 2021. In a 2023 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.14380">editorial</a> marking the journal’s 20th birthday, editors noted “submission volumes have increased exponentially.” The papers retracted to date were all published from 2022 to 2024.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.70010?af=R">August 2024 notice</a> announcing the expansion of the journal’s editorial board, the editors noted the increase in submissions was due, in part, to papermill activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/19/environmental-toxicology-wiley-journal-retractions-compromised-peer-review/">Earlier this year</a>, Wiley retracted 26 papers from a different journal, <em>Environmental Toxicology</em>, for compromised peer review as part of an ongoing investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley has had a lot of experience with mass retractions for peer review issues in recent years. After buying Hindawi in 2021, Wiley has been attempting to clean up journals it acquired. (Neither<em> International Wound Journal </em>nor <em>Environmental Toxicology</em> are former Hindawi titles.) In 2023, Hindawi <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">announced</a> it would be retracting 8,000 articles for paper mill activity. Wiley has retracted over 11,000 papers from former Hindawi journals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A former cancer specialist sanctioned for “recklessly falsifying data” admitted during an investigation interview that he periodically altered images, documents obtained by Retraction Watch show. He also stated “he may have inadequately or improperly labeled and organized” image files, increasing the chances the images were confused or misidentified.</p>



<p>Alan Lichtenstein, previously a staff physician at the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and faculty member at UCLA, engaged in research misconduct, according to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/18/2024-26756/findings-of-research-misconduct-c">a November 2024 notice</a> in the Federal Register. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UCLA-Records-24-4517-Lichtenstein-memos-only.pdf">Documents we obtained</a> through a public records request revealed his admissions, made during an inquiry that preceded the misconduct ruling.</p>



<p>The documents also reveal a relatively swift process: The initial inquiry by a joint UCLA-VA GLA committee took from June to August 2023 to determine a full investigation should follow. The investigation committee, formally tasked in October of that year, finished its assessment in March 2024. The inquiry committee looked at 18 allegations across 12 papers, and the investigation considered 31 allegations in 13 papers.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131539"></span>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/19/cancer-specialist-faked-data-in-at-least-ten-papers-va-and-ucla-find/">As we reported at the time</a>, the investigation focused on about a dozen papers with evidence of image similarities. Three of those papers had been retracted when the Federal Register notice was published.</p>



<p>A fourth paper has now joined that list: <em>Blood</em>, the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology,<em> </em>retracted the 2003 article, “<a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/101/8/3126/16683/RETRACTED-Downstream-effectors-of-oncogenic-ras-in">Downstream effectors of oncogenic ras in multiple myeloma cells</a>.” The retraction notice published March 12 states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>An institutional investigation found falsified data in Figures 2, 3, and 4. Images in these figures include reused panels that create false representations. The Editors concur with these findings.</p>



<p>Jung-hsin Hsu, Joseph Gera, and Brian Van Ness approve the retraction. No response was received from Liping Hu, Yijiang Shi, or Alan Lichtenstein.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The article has been cited 116 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The director of the VA GLA initiated a misconduct inquiry on June 23, 2023, after the research integrity officer at the institution received 10 emails in April of that year from an anonymous source, according to the documents we obtained. As we reported in November, that source was scientific sleuth Kevin Patrick, who also had called the papers out on PubPeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The committee interviewed Lichtenstein on Aug. 10, 2023, as part of that initial inquiry. By that point he had retired from UCLA and VA GLA. A memo from the research misconduct inquiry committee to the VA director, dated Aug. 18, 2023, summarized the interview. </p>



<p>The inquiry report said Lichtenstein told interviewers all original data and lab books were discarded when he closed his lab when he retired. The report stated the researcher told interviewers he “had no knowledge of the present whereabouts of any of the gel images or other original data.”</p>



<p>The documents note that, as part of the investigation, the VA research integrity officer searched Lichtenstein’s network drives but “was unable to identify any files that were material to the investigation.”</p>



<p>Lichtenstein told interviewers the first author of the publications “was always the person who cast and ran the gels in the laboratory,” according to the inquiry report. Lab staff would email the original images to Lichtenstein as a PowerPoint file, which he would save “according to the protein probe used and were formatted and arranged into the figures that were eventually published.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The later investigation report stated those images were formatted and arranged “exclusively” by Lichtenstein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The interview summary in the inquiry report stated Lichtenstein admitted to altering images, and that poor labeling could have led to wrong files getting used:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Respondent admitted to altering the contrast, brightness, and aspect ratio of the images at times, claiming that he did not know this was inappropriate. He admitted that since many of the files may have been inadequately or improperly labeled, there is a chance that some of the files may have been confused or misidentified, with consequent multiple use and mislabeling.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked about specific allegations, including duplicate band pairs and duplicated images, he did not challenge them, the documents state: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Respondent attributed all of these alleged errors to “sloppiness” and not to any systematic modification of the data intended to alter their interpretation; indeed, he stands behind all of the conclusions stated in every publication in which he was senior author and further states that many of the conclusions drawn from his publications have been confirmed by other publications.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lichtenstein also stated the 10 papers in the investigation on which he was the senior author “represent a small fraction of the 60 or so publications published under his name within the same time period, for which no such duplications have been alleged,” the interview summary states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to conversations about vaccines and autism, we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=vaccines+autism">always have plenty to write about</a>. And the latest news that the Trump administration has tapped David Geier for a study on possible links between immunizations and autism, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/">first reported by the <em>Washington Post</em></a>, is no exception.</p>



<p>Geier has a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28Geier+DA%5BAuthor%5D%29+AND+%28autism%29+AND+%28thimerosal%29">long history</a> of promoting <a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/a-comprehensive-review-of-the-mmr">the debunked claim</a> of a link between vaccines and autism, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/26/rfk-jr-vaccine-study-of-autism-links-led-by-vaccine-critic-scientists-shocked/"><em>STAT</em> and others report</a>. He has published on the topic as recently as 2020. A December 2020 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32534375/">paper</a> lists his affiliation as the Institute of Chronic Illnesses, <a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierCharge05162011.pdf">an organization he founded</a> with his father Mark Geier, court documents say. In 2011, the Maryland State Board of Physicians <a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierOrder07.302.pdf">disciplined</a> Geier for practicing medicine without a license. He’s currently <a href="https://directory.psc.gov/hhsdir/eeKey.asp?Key=69704&amp;Format=Table">listed</a> in the HHS employee directory as a senior data analyst, the <em>Post </em>reports. </p>



<p>Geier’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/15/journal-replaces-anti-vaccine-paper-retracted-missing-conflicts-number-errors/">first appearance in Retraction Watch</a> was in 2017, when <em>Science and Engineering Ethics</em>, a Springer Nature title, retracted a paper on how conflicts of interest might influence research on the link between vaccines and autism. That paper has been cited 13 times according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<span id="more-131521"></span>



<p>While there’s irony in the retraction of a paper on conflicts of interest for issues with conflicts of interest, the key part of that story is that the journal replaced it with a new version of the paper with an updated conflict of interest statement and changes throughout — and <a href="https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-017-9983-2">this paper remains intact</a>. It has been cited seven times. </p>



<p>Geier was one of 10 authors on that paper, including his father Mark. Coauthors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/08/27/journal-takes-down-autism-vaccine-paper-pending-investigation/">Brian</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/04/journal-makes-it-official-retracting-controversial-autism-vaccine-paper/">Hooker</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/15/study-of-autism-and-vitamin-d-earns-retraction-after-questions-about-reliability/">Geir Bjorklund</a> have appeared in Retraction Watch for their own retractions.</p>



<p>Geier’s history with lost papers begins more than a decade earlier, with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997206001686">a 2006 paper</a> withdrawn before it was even officially published, Brian Deer <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/334/7595/666">reported in <em>BMJ</em></a> in 2007 — three years before Retraction Watch was founded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Last October, <em>Autoimmunity Reviews</em> published online the draft of a seven page paper by reporting laboratory and clinical tests suggesting that thiomersal, a mercury based preservative once routinely added to most vaccines, was the main culprit for a sharp rise in diagnoses of behavioural disorders. The paper was written by Dr Mark Geier, a self employed American geneticist, and his son David. The pair also reported treating autistic children with a hormone product, leuprorelin acetate, which is sometimes prescribed for precocious puberty. They claimed that the drug produced “very significant overall clinical improvements” with “minimal” adverse effects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But before <a href="https://briandeer.com/wakefield/geier-mark.pdf">that draft</a> was finalized, <em>Autoimmunity Reviews</em>, an Elsevier title, withdrew the paper with no specific reason listed. (We’ve criticized Elsevier’s practices for withdrawals, which seem to violate Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/02/25/is-an-article-in-press-published-a-word-about-elseviers-withdrawal-policy/">before</a>.) Deer reported that autism activist Kathleen Seidel had sent a letter to the journal’s editor in chief and entire editorial board detailing issues with the work, including an institutional review board that included the Geiers themselves. </p>



<p>The Trump administration wants to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/24/medical-studies-rfk-nih-replication">prioritize replicating medical research</a>, Axios and others have reported, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggesting in his confirmation hearing that at least 20 percent of the NIH budget should go toward replication efforts. But studies of a link between vaccines and autism diagnoses have failed to find a connection time and time again.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have already done that many times over. It wastes valuable resources to revisit the same question instead of using them to address critical health challenges,&#8221; David Higgins, a practicing pediatrician and health services researcher at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, told Axios. &#8220;Reexamining settled questions that have already been repeated, replicated, and tested many times is not healthy skepticism; it&#8217;s cynicism and science denial.&#8221;</p>
