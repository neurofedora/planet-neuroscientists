                Abstract:  The Illinois Newspaper Project has existed in some form for nearly four decades and has evolved through project locations, staffing, and areas of focus. Collaborative efforts of the project have depended on the phase of work, staff levels, and institutional resources, and were strong in the project’s early years but slowed down between 2011-2023. Most recently, as an homage to the project’s early collaborative roots and supported by the institutional resources of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U. of I.), the INP has been well-equipped to serve as a state resource for newspaper preservation and digitization in alliance with the University’s land grant mission. The INP has built partnerships with cultural heritage institutions across the state to preserve and provide freely available access to Illinois historical newspapers through its digital newspaper platform, the Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections (IDNC).

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naohiro-kameta.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="198" height="256" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naohiro-kameta.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132666"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Naohiro Kameta</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A chemistry journal has retracted a 2020 review article by a nanotube researcher who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/10/retractions-begin-for-chemist-found-to-have-faked-data-in-42-papers/">fabricated and falsified data</a> in dozens of studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest retraction for Naohiro Kameta brings his total to 40, earning him a place on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">Retraction Watch Leaderboard</a>. </p>



<p>In a 2020 review article in <em>Chemical Reviews</em>, 24 of the 610 works Kameta and his coauthors cited had themselves been retracted following the publication of the paper, according to <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5c00539">the retraction notice</a>. Because these references were “important components” of the review article, “the narrative and claims presented can no longer be upheld,” the notice reads. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00509">The review</a> has been cited 164 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<span id="more-132663"></span>



<p>All 24 of the works mentioned in the retraction notice were <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">among 42 papers identified as fraudulent</a> in a 2024 investigation by Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), where Kameta worked in the Nanomaterials Research Institute <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/au20240731_1.html">until his dismissal</a> last year. The retraction notice does not mention the inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A coauthor on the review was Kameta’s AIST colleague Toshimi Shimizu, who the institution’s investigation stated was responsible for the content of the papers but was not involved in any misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around the same time as the retraction, French computer scientist Guillaume Cabanac posted on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D40E77CF94EA5EEA609FBEDA593EFD#1">PubPeer </a>warning readers to “reassess the reliability of the document” since it contained 23 references flagged by the Problematic Paper Screener, a tool that identifies suspicious papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cabanac <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1557F198FA7DC1569A44B36C1E1942#0">also flagged</a> another article containing references to 18 of Kameta’s retracted works. Shimizu is the sole author of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bcsj/article/91/4/623/7333093">that paper</a>, published in <em>Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan</em>. Shimizu could not be reached for comment via his institutional email. Editors at the journal have not responded to a request for comment. </p>



<p>As AIST <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/Portals/0/resource_images/aist_j/information/240329_anken1.pdf">wrote in its report</a> about the investigation, Kameta repeatedly altered electron micrographs and misrepresented scale bars in the 42 papers they found linked to misconduct so he could publish as many papers as possible. The investigation also found his research records were incomplete and that his samples had been discarded.The misconduct was evident across nearly two decades of Kameta’s work, according to AIST.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_j/news/announce/au20240329_3.html">announcement of their findings</a>, AIST warned researchers to “please be careful when citing [the flagged papers], as the content is factually incorrect.” In an email this week, the institution’s media office wrote that individual researchers would not be responding to our questions about other papers citing Kameta, nor would the institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since our earlier reporting on this case, all of Kameta’s articles in journals owned by the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry mentioned in the investigation have now been retracted. The six remaining unretracted papers appear to be published in Japanese language journals or are conference proceedings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the recently retracted papers contained problems with scale bars, with one reported as being <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/cc/d4cc90364a">46 times longer</a> than it should have been. Many also included manually manipulated images and some where the original images <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c03020">couldn’t be found</a>. The retraction notices cite these errors as examples of the scientific misconduct identified by AIST, which recommended the retractions. They also make clear Kameta was responsible for the misconduct, while his coauthors were not implicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kameta, who does not appear to have published any new articles since 2024, could not be reached for comment via his institutional email.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An Elsevier journal allowed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950307825000633#sec0015a">a paper</a> containing extensive plagiarism to remain online, while letting its authors make undisclosed revisions that masked the offense, Retraction Watch has learned. But the journal’s editor-in-chief told us he has subsequently decided to retract the paper.</p>



<p>The article, on cognitive impairment among older adults in India, appeared online on June 15 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sharma-et-al-preproof-archives-of-gerontology.pdf">as a pre-proof</a> in <em>Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Plus</em>. At that point, its background section included several long paragraphs that were identical, or near-identical, to text in<a href="https://epc2024.eaps.nl/uploads/240969"> an extended conference abstract</a> from 2024. The study’s objectives and methods also bore strong similarity to the earlier work, which had been conducted by another group of researchers.</p>



<p>Poulami Barman, first author of the conference abstract and a dual-program Ph.D. student in India and Germany, became aware her work had been stolen after one of her supervisors alerted her to the new paper. It turned out she knew the article’s corresponding author well. Like Barman, Madhurima Sharma was a Ph.D. student at the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) in Mumbai, and she had previously asked Barman to share her code. Barman had refused to do so until her work was published.</p>



<span id="more-132658"></span>



<p>Shocked at what she had discovered, Barman messaged Sharma.</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?” Sharma wrote back in correspondence we obtained. “I did not even see your paper,” she added, referring to the abstract. “So how can I copy?”</p>



<p>She had written her paper “with the help of ai and as well as existing literatures [sic],” Sharma claimed.</p>



<p>But the plagiarism was impossible to miss, with clear overlap in both text and study design. On June 23, Barman, who is also&nbsp; at the University of Rostock, in Germany, contacted the journal, providing a side-by-side comparison of the two works. A journal manager replied that the publisher would look into her complaint.</p>



<p>A few days later, Barman noticed that the plagiarized paragraphs had been revised in the paper’s version of record, dated June 30, without any explanation. She again contacted the journal to find out what was going on, but didn’t hear back.</p>



<p>Then on July 22, Sharma sent Barman an email stating she had revised her paper “in full coordination with the journal editor” after “being made aware of the overlap” between their texts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They let her modify the article, and that was, like, completely unethical,” Barman told us. “It should be retracted because it was completely plagiarized.”</p>



<p>When Barman wrote to the journal yet again, she was told by the journal manager on July 24 that “the investigation is on-going and our Editor in Chief &amp; Publisher are already discussing on this matter to find a better solution.”</p>



<p>Sharma told us that after being contacted by the journal, “I recognized my mistake and immediately took action and revised the document. The Journal subsequently informed me that the revised paper was acceptable and published it.”</p>



<p>She also said some of the data her study was based on differed from those Barman had used, adding, “Objectives and results are different.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharma did not respond to follow-up questions asking what exactly her “mistake” had been.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liang-Kung Chen, editor-in-chief of <em>Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Plus</em>, told us he had “decided to retract this paper on July 26, so we did have certain actions on this paper. The retraction process is going on at the publisher’s (Elsevier’s) end.”</p>



<p>After learning the journal had allowed Sharma to change the plagiarized text, Barman took to LinkedIn to vent her frustration in<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7354506033366458368-57Gc/"> a post</a> that garnered dozens of comments, several of them from scholars describing similar experiences. One implicated Sharma.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, something very similar happened to me with the same author you mentioned,” wrote Sayani Das, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Social Work at Bar-Ilan University, in Israel. “She asked me for all the details and then published her paper based on my preprint. Since then, I’ve stopped sharing papers as preprints, as I’m afraid of such so-called researchers.”</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/linkedin-screenshot-barman-sharma.jpg">a rejoinder on LinkedIn</a> that disappeared when Barman blocked her, Sharma wrote, in part, “I want to state clearly and unequivocally: I did not copy either of your work [sic] not your title, not your tables, and not your results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Srinivas Goli, an associate professor at IIPS, said in a comment on the post he had “consistently emphasized in my classes that you don’t need dozens or hundreds of papers to advance in your academic and professional career.” But, he added, “Unfortunately, a deeply flawed mindset has taken root among some students, pushing them toward shortcuts and unethical practices. We must remind them that a successful career is not built on the number of papers but on skills, knowledge and ethics.”</p>



<p>Asked for comment, IIPS told us it would try to sort out what had happened in a physical meeting with “the student” and requested us “not to proceed in this matter.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the second author of the offending paper, Abdul Fathah, also a doctoral student at IIPS, wrote on LinkedIn that his “sole contribution to the paper was in conducting the data analysis.”</p>



<p>“I was not informed or made aware that substantial portions of the manuscript were copied from another researcher’s work,” Fathah wrote. “I deeply regret this serious breach of academic ethics, and I unreservedly condemn plagiarism of any kind.”</p>

<p>A 23-year-old paper has received an addendum for “possible inadvertent errors” in the figures. But a sleuth says the update doesn’t address issues with the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ni852">2002 paper</a>, which describes the behavior of Langerhans cells in normal and inflamed skin, was published in <em>Nature Immunology</em> and has been cited 774 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article received <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ni0103-92">a correction</a> in 2003 to replace two “incorrect” figures. Over 20 years later, PubPeer commenter “Archasia belfragei” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/524A810F7E210DBB96D41D17320461">flagged issues</a> with different figures, noting in December that some PCR bands were “more similar than expected.”</p>



<span id="more-132648"></span>



<p>An addendum this April addressed the data errors, which, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-025-02131-9">according to the notice</a>, “may have occurred during the assembly of PCR measurements.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/miriam-merad">Miriam Merad</a>, lead author of the paper and now Chair of the Department of Immunology and Immunotherapy at Mount Sinai in New York, called the similarity between bands an “unfortunate mistake in assembling the PCR.” She told us “the PCR that was misassembled was measuring housekeeping genes, which are expressed by all cells” and were not the focus of the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research was conducted at Irving Weissman’s lab at Stanford University in California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But image expert and sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">David Sanders</a> told us the addendum is “inadequate in multiple senses.” While the correction applied to two proteins, the “problematic” data involve the expression of a third, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The argument that an image concerning protein expression … somehow justifies thoroughly flawed images of RNA levels is absurd,” Sanders said. The “extent and nature of the problems with the figures would, in my opinion, dictate that the article should have been retracted,” he added.</p>



<p>Merad <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Sanders_Merad-emails-nature-immunology-2002-paper.pdf">responded</a> to Sanders’ concerns by emphasizing “there was no misconduct here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the paper’s authors, Harvard professor <a href="https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/people/amy-wagers-phd">Amy Wagers</a>, had another correction earlier this year to a 2023 paper in <em>Nature Aging</em>. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00804-6">author correction</a> addressed “potential duplication in two of the micrographs shown in the paper,” the January notice reads. Two of the probes were “unintentionally swapped” while the authors prepared images for the final submission of the paper. Wagers was one of 20 coauthors on this paper, which has been cited 37 times. She did not respond to email requests for comment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/people/amy-wagers-phd">Wagers</a> is the cochair of Harvard’s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. In 2010, Wagers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/10/14/highly-cited-harvard-stem-cell-scientist-retracts-nature-paper/">retracted a paper</a> from <em>Nature </em>for data concerns. A postdoc in Wagers’ lab was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/03/17/in-a-retractions-wake-postdoc-shane-mayack-dismissed-from-amy-wagers-stem-cell-lab-speaks-out/">dismissed</a> after accepting responsibility for the “duplicated data and other inappropriate manipulations” cited in a retraction in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/12/27/blood-retracts-stem-cell-paper-from-amy-wagers-harvard-lab-after-14-months-of-concern/">2011 from <em>Blood</em></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/people/lee-l-rubin">Lee Rubin</a>, co-corresponding author and professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard, told us a coauthor of the paper discovered the mistake with the figures. “We are upset that we made the mistake but feel like we rectified it quickly and openly,” he said.</p>

<p>Four papers from a team of researchers in Japan have received expressions of concern for overlap in control samples, data, study design and statistical analyses. The publisher of the articles says it has closed its investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299145">The</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274735">notices</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273868">were</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273456">published</a> in <em>PLOS One</em> from July 31 to August 3 to inform readers of “study design concerns” and to provide additional supplementary data. They also cite a pair of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56414-x">related</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gtc.13150">papers</a> in other journals for the same problems, but those articles remain unmarked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Masaya Oki, a professor of applied chemistry and biotechnology at the University of Fukui in Japan, is the corresponding author on all six papers. Each discusses the effects of a different gene inhibitor on cataracts taken from rat eyes. While the authors used multiple methods to study these effects, the EOCs concern the results obtained using microarrays to compare lens samples.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132634"></span>



<p>The nearly identical notices cite concerns about overlapping samples, datasets, and the fact that the papers all use the same ethical approval number. According to the EOCs, “the corresponding author stated that each article is interconnected and used data from the same control and galactose microarrays in order to compare samples collected at different time points, whilst the inhibitor samples in each article differ.”</p>



<p>However, the investigation at <em>PLOS One </em>reached a different conclusion about the reliability of this approach. The EOCs state, “based on input received from the <em>PLOS One </em>Editorial Board and a statistical reviewer, PLOS concluded that the microarray study design and data analyses were not performed to a high technical standard and call into question the reliability of the microarray results.” The notices list multiple issues with the study design and statistical analyses performed on the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before providing additional supplementary data to back up the claims, the EOCs state, “PLOS concluded that the reliability of the microarray data is in question given the study design concerns, but the main conclusions in [this paper] are supported by the RT-qPCR results which are not critically dependent on the microarray results and which validated the microarray findings pursued in [this paper] for follow-up studies.”</p>



<p>While publishers can use expressions of concern as an interim notice to readers about a potential problem with a paper, “in this case, PLOS has concluded the editorial investigation into the concerns raised, and the EOC notices are published as a permanent editorial outcome,” Maria Zalm, publication ethics team manager at the company, told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>Three of the <em>PLOS One </em>papers were published in 2022, and the fourth in February 2024. “PLOS first became aware of the concerns with these articles in late April 2024,” Zalm told us. Zalm declined to state how the publisher became aware of the concerns. None of the papers has been flagged on PubPeer.</p>



<p>The EOCs cite two other papers not published at <em>PLOS One</em>. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56414-x">2019 article</a> appeared in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, published by Springer Nature. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gtc.13150">second</a> was published in September 2024 in <em>Genes to Cells</em>, published by Wiley. Spokespeople from both companies confirmed they recently began investigations into the research.</p>



<p>“The authors responded to all queries raised by PLOS to address the issues raised with the articles and collaborated with PLOS to ensure the accuracy of the resulting notices,” Zalm said.</p>



<p>Oki declined to comment on the record, telling us, “we were required to promise that we would not respond to any further inquiries on the matter.” In a followup email, Oki said “it was the journal” that made the request.</p>



<p>David Knutson, head of communications at PLOS, told us the journal “made no such request of the authors.”</p>



<p>The six papers have collectively been cited 72 times according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>

As the weeks of summer draw to a close, families are cramming in the last moments of summer fun while simultaneously gearing up for school drops offs and new classroom schedules. While it can be an incredibly exciting time, filled with first day of school outfits and new school gear, it can also be incredibly stressful. This can be particularly true for teenagers who, compared to younger kids, are facing higher academic demands and social pressure while experiencing the major physical and developmental changes that come during adolescence. On top of that, a 2023 Center of Disease Control report showed that teens of today have higher rates of mental health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, and that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasing. This can make the return to school daunting for teens, as well as parents who are worried about how their child will manage the transition and demands of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, there are several tools that parents and caregivers can use to prepare kids and teens for the first few weeks in September. This includes setting clear expectations, skills to encourage helpful behavior, and strategies that help kids feel supported by their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Setting expectations&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>While many kids prefer to keep their heads in the sand when it comes to a new academic cycle, it can be incredibly helpful to set expectations for the school year a few weeks in advance. The most basic version of this includes outlining differences between summer versus school schedules, such as changes to sleep and wake times, limits to screens, or daily responsibilities. This preview can help kids’ brains prepare for the upcoming shifts in their daily lives and make the transition a little smoother. It’s also a great idea to talk to kids about how the upcoming school year might be different than the last one. This could include providing information on class size, the structure of the day, or increased expectations. The goal is not to scare your kids about everything coming their way, but rather to provide them with simple clear information in a manner that builds excitement. For example, “It’s so fun that you get to go to go off-campus for lunch this year. I bet it will make the day feel way more interesting!” Or, “I know high school is bigger than middle school. It may feel a little overwhelming, but it’s also such a great time for you to see how capable you are.” &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Encouraging positive behaviors&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Once expectations have been set, parents can also work to encourage brave or skillful behavior. This may include things like taking more responsibility (e.g., managing their own communication with teachers and coaches), growing outside of their comfort zone (e.g., joining a new club or social circle), or challenging themselves with new opportunities or roles (e.g., a first job or harder courseload). This most effective way to do this is through a skill called “labeled praise.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Labeled praise is when you show appreciation for a specific behavior or characteristic your child is demonstrating. When it comes to a new school year, parents can look for opportunities to praise preparation, flexibility, and bravery. For example, “I know you really loved your teachers last year, and I appreciate how openminded you are about your new schedule.” Another parent may say, “Great call on getting to bed a little earlier this week. It’ll make the start of school so much easier!” For teens who haven’t mastered brave or skillful choices, parents can offer cheerleading and encouragement. Phrases like “I know you’re going to do a beautiful job making friends because you’ve done it before!” or “10<sup>th</sup> grade is tough, and I have total confidence that you’re going to find a way to balance everything” send a message that they really believe in their kid. This can go a long way towards encouraging positive behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Providing validation&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When you do notice your child having a hard time, whether it’s nerves, low mood, or difficulty organizing themselves for a new semester, it’s always a great idea to offer validation. Validation is a skill used to show somebody that you can see their perspective or understand where they are coming from. Validation can be a tricky skill to master for caregivers because it is sometimes hard to put yourself in your child’s shoes, or you are eager to get them to see a new perspective. For example, when your child complains about their new math teacher who they have heard is a hard grader, it’s tempting to say “Nah! I’m sure it’ll be fine!” This may work for some kids. However, it can come off as dismissive and hard to believe for a teen whose anxiety or stress is high. Instead, try validation: “It makes sense that you’re nervous based on what you’ve heard!” While you aren’t agreeing with your child’s worries, you <em>are</em> acknowledging them, and that can help increase a sense of connection and communication. Once your child feels understood, they’ll be better able to think clearly about the situation and problem solve as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As you navigate another year of permission slips, homework, and extracurricular activities, remember that you have a handful of tools in your pocket to help ease the way. With a little bit of preparation, encouragement, and support, you and child can start the school year off on a great foot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em><sup>Feature image: Photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@romulusprince?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Wajih Ghali</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/yellow-plastic-hair-comb-beside-black-ipad-JcMURhAPNGk?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.</sup></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/923639546/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/923639546/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/923639546/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/923639546/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/923639546/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2025%2f08%2fback-to-school-blog-480x194.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/923639546/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/923639546/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/923639546/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/923639546/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2025/08/5-books-to-master-your-transition-to-college-reading-list/">5 books to master your transition to college [reading list]</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2025/08/a-snapshot-of-genomics-and-bioinformatics-in-modern-biology-research/">A snapshot of genomics and bioinformatics in modern biology research</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2025/07/knowledge-and-teaching-in-the-age-of-information/">Knowledge and teaching in the age of information</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>A prominent education researcher in Australia is demanding compensation from a critic whose claims of plagiarism triggered the university to look into his work. Although the resulting examination of work by John Hattie, director of an education research institute at the University of Melbourne, ended without a finding of misconduct, the critic, Stephen Vainker, insists Hattie’s publications are rife with data errors and insufficient attribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker came across “strange” citations in a paper by Hattie while studying for his doctorate in education management seven years ago. At first, he found 12 sentences lifted word-for-word, he said, from the original source about workplace management without proper citation. Among them were seven instances in which words such as “people” or &#8220;individuals&#8221; were changed to education-related words, such as “students.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then Vainker looked through Hattie’s most popular and influential text, <em>Visible Learning</em>,<em> </em>and its sequel, as well as his doctoral thesis, finding what he claimed were hundreds of data errors and examples of plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132618"></span>



<p>“I looked up what they wrote that [Hattie] was citing,” Vainker, now a teacher in England, told Retraction Watch. “And then I just realized it was exactly the same, word-for-word.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker compiled his findings into two non-peer reviewed articles, and sent them last summer to the University of Melbourne. According to a report we have seen, the university has decided Vainker&#8217;s findings don’t warrant further investigation, despite finding errors in Hattie’s work they thought should be corrected, and deficiencies in his citation practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since reporting his findings, Vainker has heard from Hattie’s lawyers demanding he apologize, retract his comments and withdraw his complaint to the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hattie maintains that he has never plagiarized another person’s work, according to a letter his lawyers sent us. Hattie also claims Vainker’s “defamatory” allegations constitute “cyber-bullying and trolling.” In May, Hattie commenced formal legal proceedings against Vainker in the Supreme Court of Victoria, in Australia, after Vainker didn’t remove his allegations from online platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When <em>Visible Learning</em> first came out in 2008, its central idea that educators could tangibly increase student learning through interventions — such as self-reported grades, timely feedback and positive teacher-student relationships — influenced schools around the world. Government reports cited the findings and they became part of an education reform movement.</p>



<p>Hattie’s book draws on more than 800 meta-analyses, or a collective total of more than 50,000 smaller studies, ranking interventions using a statistical measure called Cohen&#8217;s d, which describes the size of an effect. Since its release, Hattie has faced criticism about <a href="https://visablelearning.blogspot.com/">studies counted multiple times</a>, <a href="https://www.scup.com/doi/10.18261/ISSN1504-2987-2011-06-06">incomparable populations</a> and other <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284499397_Invisible_Learnings_A_commentary_on_John_Hattie's_book_visible_learning_A_synthesis_of_over_800_metaanalyses_relating_to_achievement">statistical calculations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a letter sent on behalf of Hattie, his lawyers told us that he “welcomes healthy and respectful academic debate,” and has provided a “robust defence” of his research methods <a href="https://www.visiblelearning.com/content/gold-papers">in an online series called The Gold Papers.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker says he found more serious concerns in Hattie’s publications, alleging that Hattie has plagiarized 537 times in his Ph.D. thesis, <em>Visible Learning</em> and the book’s sequel, with 432 of those being insufficient paraphrasing and the others examples of copying the source material directly. Vainker also raised concerns about data errors in Hattie’s work, claiming that several meta-analyses had been incorrectly included because of issues with dependent and independent variables, as well as duplicated inclusions and papers that weren’t meta-analyses to begin with. He also claimed data had been extracted or presented incorrectly — amounting to more than 200 alleged errors in the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker documented the first findings in a May 2024 manuscript titled “<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rzjc9_v1">John Hattie’s failures of academic integrity and the fragility of the education reform movement</a>.” He followed with a second manuscript in March this year, “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390235308_THE_CAREER_OF_JOHN_HATTIE_PLAGIARISM_MISCONDUCT_AND_THE_COARSENING_OF_EDUCATION">The Career of John Hattie: Plagiarism, Misconduct, and the Coarsening of Education</a>.” He also posted about his findings on the social media platform X.</p>



<p>In June 2024, Vainker took his findings to the University of Melbourne. The university conducted a preliminary assessment of whether the meta-analyses data in Hattie’s online database — essentially an online version of the data found in the book — had been falsified, fabricated or misrepresented, and whether Hattie had plagiarized material in the sequel to <em>Visible Learning</em>. Hattie produced both works while at the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, in a letter we have seen<em> </em>that describes the results of the university’s assessment, Kate Smith-Miles, the university’s pro vice-chancellor of research capability, acknowledged to Vainker that the database contained “unintended” errors which “should be corrected,” and that Hattie could improve his citation practices. But she concluded that a formal investigation was not “necessary or appropriate” and that unintentional errors do not typically constitute research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university’s research integrity office did not directly respond to our questions about the investigation, saying the university “addresses all concerns about research integrity under the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research, a structured process that prioritises procedural fairness, confidentiality and integrity.” They added that confidentiality “is essential to ensure any investigation process is conducted fairly. This includes protecting the rights of those raising concerns and those subject to review.”</p>



<p>According to Smith-Miles’ letter, the university engaged an independent expert, Michael Hebert of the University of California, Irvine, to look at the data errors. Hebert confirmed mistakes in 11 of the 14 randomly selected examples of data error, and identified 20 more possible errors. He attributed the issues to human error or methodological choices, but not deliberate falsification. The letter describes that Hattie disputed Hebert’s findings, calling the data errors“insignificant” to the database as a whole and “negligible at best.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hebert also recommended Hattie work with a team with broader expertise to improve the reliability of the database. Hattie rejected that suggestion, saying he personally coded the data with assistance from research aids, and that a big team was unnecessary. Hebert has not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university also reviewed 14 of the 181 alleged instances of plagiarism Vainker had submitted. It concluded none amounted to plagiarism, though 10 were potential examples of “questionable citation practices.” In the letter, Hattie defends his citations practices by referring to one of the leading citation style guides in social sciences research – the APA7 — which suggests against over-citing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Melbourne chose not to investigate further, although the report acknowledges that when taken as a whole, the citation errors “may suggest more widespread citation and referencing issues with The Sequel,” according to the letter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker criticized the university’s approach, saying they “wanted to sound as tough as possible in the report without actually fully investigating it.” He said there was “no possible reason to take a sample” instead of checking all 181 plagiarism allegations. “You could look at that in an hour, and you could check each one out in a week. They’ve taken a year,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker asked the university which of the 14 examples of purported plagiarism it had chosen to review. In the same email, he pointed to 11 examples he said showed word-for-word copying. On July 11, a research integrity officer at the university acknowledged that the additional examples “have given rise to concerns which were not apparent from our initial random sample review.” The officer said the university was seeking additional information from Hattie, whose response would determine whether further action was warranted.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Vainker had previously sent Hattie the plagiarism allegations in his first publication from May 2024. That paper alleged that Hattie had taken text directly from goal-setting theorists, replacing workplace terms with educational ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hattie responded August 2024, writing that academics “thrive on critique,” though it has been his policy “not to react to critiques.” He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>You claim I have plagiarized, lack academic integrity, introduce false totals, am flippant, etc. These are serious charges. I strongly claim that these claims are unfair and untrue &#8212; the 3.5 pages that you focus on clearly relies on Locke and Latham’s work – as noted in the pages. I have checked with appropriate sources and they see no issues. It is clear I am indeed paraphrasing their work, adopting it into a more educational sphere, and there is NO doubt that this is Locke and Latham&#8217;s work. Further, there is NO evidence of plagiarism. The 7th ed APA Manual of Style clearly states that overciting should be avoided… there is no doubt that the work relies on and is attributed to Locke and Latham.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the email, he invited Vainker to remove the “potentially defamatory” claims about plagiarism and republish the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few months after Hattie’s email, just before Christmas, Vainker heard from Hattie’s lawyers. Their letter accused Vainker of defamation over the 2024 paper and 12 posts on X about his findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vainker’s posts on X accuse Hattie of <a href="https://x.com/StephenVainker/status/1799200002306081121">plagiarism</a> and <a href="https://x.com/StephenVainker/status/1796148314695508199">failing to uphold academic standards</a>, and call his database <a href="https://x.com/StephenVainker/status/1823664584579817628">“total garbage.”</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawyers demanded that he remove the paper and the posts, apologize, pay Hattie’s legal fees and compensation, and withdraw his complaint to the University of Melbourne’s Office of Research Integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-to-Ms-Youmshajekian-re-Prof-Hattie-20.08.2025_Redacted.pdf">statement sent to us from his lawyers</a>, Hattie said: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I have never plagiarised another person’s work. I have always welcomed the fair and objective academic critique of my research and of Visible Learning. However, Dr Vainker’s article and his posts about me on X go well beyond this. He has engaged in a deliberate and personal attack on my reputation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Dr Vainker has published a voluminous number of posts and comments about me on X which he has acknowledged are designed to ruin my reputation and thereby bring an end to the education reform movement.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“In engaging in this vitriolic campaign against me and my work, Dr Vainker has himself failed to act with academic integrity. He has instead acted with malice. …</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Dr Vainker has never sought to discuss his views about my work with me or correspond with me in a respectful way as one would expect of a fellow academic. In those circumstances, his allegations that I have acted dishonestly and without integrity are simply indefensible.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Publishing the article and his posts on X about me are part of a broader campaign Dr Vainker has waged against me, which is nothing short of cyber-bullying and trolling.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lawyers also told us that Hattie was unable to comment on the University of Melbourne’s investigation, citing confidentiality, but maintain that Vainker’s complaint to the university is “unsubstantiated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve done the work, I&#8217;ve checked it, I know I&#8217;m right,” Vainker said of the lawyers’ demands to him. “I think the only possible role it could have would be to scare me off, once you actually start getting into it… he hasn&#8217;t got a case.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t think he could write the books that he has without plagiarizing,” Vainker said. “And so I think the plagiarism, I think it&#8217;s not just sloppiness, I think it&#8217;s essential to his work.”&nbsp;</p>
