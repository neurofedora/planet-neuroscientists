              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/total-solar-eclipse-sun-science-viewing-2024">Why the 2024 total solar eclipse will be such a big deal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Solar eclipses are dramatic events as a rule. But the total eclipse coming on April 8 is going to ratchet up the experience.</p>



<p>Compared with the last total eclipse that crossed the United States, in 2017, this year’s total eclipse will last longer, the sky will fall darker, and the sun itself will put on a much livelier show. And millions more people will be able to step outside their front doors to see one of the most astounding astronomical events of their lives.</p>



<p>It will also be the last major eclipse to cross North America for 20 years. All of that means that it’s an especially rare opportunity for casual observers and scientists alike. Here are a few things to know about this spectacular event.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why will this eclipse last longer and feature a more active sun?</h4>



<p>The moon will be at a point in its orbit that’s comparatively close to Earth in April, making the moon appear particularly large. As a result, for anyone fortunate enough to make it to the path of totality — where the moon completely blocks out the sun’s disk — it will be an especially dark eclipse that will last for nearly 4½ minutes. That’s almost two minutes longer than the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-knowledge">Great American Eclipse</a> of 2017 (<em>SN: 8/11/17</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, the sun will be close to solar maximum in 2024. That’s the peak of its roughly 11-year activity cycle. As a result, lots of bright, petal-like streamers of plasma will extend from the solar corona, the sun’s outer atmosphere. The increase in solar activity also ups the chances of a coronal mass ejection, a large puff of hot gas trapped in a loop of magnetic field that’s blasted away from the sun’s surface.</p>



<p>A longer time to observe the eclipse and a more active sun will make it both a better show and a boon for scientists who have more telescopes, sensors and satellites available to study the sun than ever before. Even viewers without other equipment should be able to see the streamers and a coronal mass ejection, if it occurs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s different about this eclipse’s path?</h4>



<p>“There&#8217;s nearly 32 million people [who will be] inside the path [of totality],” says cartographer Michael Zeiler. That’s about 2½ times as many as during the 2017 eclipse. And “the major East Coast metros from Baltimore to Boston are all about 200 miles from the path of totality.”</p>



<p>That means that the path of totality is going be very accessible to the bulk of the U.S. population, says Zeiler, founder of GreatAmericanEclipse.com. The eclipse will be visible to some degree in every U.S. state as well as portions of northwestern Mexico and southeastern Canada.</p>

<p>The 2024 eclipse path will also be particularly helpful for researchers who use radar to study charged particles high in the atmosphere. Unlike the last two North American eclipses, says space scientist Bharat Kunduri of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, this year’s path passes within the observing range of three radars in the worldwide Super Dual Auroral Radar Network.</p>



<p>Those radars monitor a gaslike plasma of positively charged atoms and negatively charged electrons in the Earth’s atmosphere, created when the sun’s rays kick electrons off atoms. The plasma makes up the ionosphere, which can act like a mirror for radio signals and bounce signals from terrestrial transmitters back down to receivers, instead of letting the signals head out to space. That extends the range that transmitters can reach. The ionosphere also modifies the transmission of signals down to Earth from GPS satellites. Taking that effect into account is crucial for ensuring that GPS systems are accurate.</p>



<p>During a solar eclipse, as at nighttime, all the radiation from the sun goes away, and the atmosphere becomes a little less dense and less ionized. “And radio waves can behave differently,” Kunduri says. Using the instruments in the radar network during an eclipse can help scientists better understand how the sun generates the ionosphere and how the plasma layer affects transmissions from satellites and radios.</p>



<p>An eclipse “gives you an excellent opportunity to study what happens when there is a sudden change in the upper atmosphere,” he says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s unique about this chance to spot a coronal mass ejection?</h4>



<p>Because of the sun’s elevated activity this time, the chances are unusually high that terrestrial eclipse observers and space satellites could have the opportunity to simultaneously study a coronal mass ejection. Both the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter</a> and <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Parker Solar Probe</a> will be looking at the sun from the side while the eclipse is happening.</p>



<p>That means that ground-based observers would be able to watch a coronal mass ejection traveling out from the sun, while the satellites would see the event head on, if they happen to lie in the path on an ejection, and could take samples as the solar material goes blasting past. It’s the only time in the lifetimes of the two satellites that the arrangement will coincide with an eclipse at solar maximum.</p>



<p>“If we would be so lucky to have one,” says astrophysicist Nour Raouafi of Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., and it’s “propagating toward the spacecraft … it will be fascinating to see it during a total solar eclipse.”</p>



<p>Scientists want to know more about coronal mass ejections because the solar eruptions, when aimed at Earth, can disrupt communications and power grids, and potentially threaten satellites or astronauts in orbit around Earth.</p>



<p>In addition to observing any ejection, the satellites’ observations could help confirm the source of particularly speedy solar winds, which seem to be accelerated by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-origin-winds-sun">kinks that develop in magnetic fields</a> near the surface of the sun (<em>SN: 7/7/23</em>).</p>



<p>Insights into the solar wind, in turn, help explain how coronal mass ejections can affect Earth. That’s because the ejections, Raouafi says, pile up material in the solar wind, which “will affect the arrival time of these events to earth. So, knowing the conditions of the solar wind before the [ejections] is extremely important to predict when they are arriving or how important they will be.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are some of the ways that scientists plan to study this eclipse?</h4>



<p>Several experiments planned for 2024 are repeats from past eclipses. Some feature updated instrumentation. Others will benefit from observations gathered while the sun is near its solar maximum, allowing for comparisons to the more quiescent phase that the sun was in during the 2017 eclipse. All the 2024 experiments should enjoy the improvement in data quality and quantity that comes with the longer viewing time.</p>



<p>Take the WB-57F jet planes that carried instruments to observe the 2017 eclipse while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-2017-solar-eclipse-results">flying along its path</a> of totality (<em>SN 5/29/18</em>). They will be in the air again in April, says physicist Amir Caspi of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. “It’s a big improvement because we’re flying new instruments [that provide] better information. The fact that it’s solar maximum will give us a lot more things to look at.”</p>



<p>Improved cameras and spectrometers, for example, will offer detailed views of the corona close to the sun’s surface. “This eclipse is also twice as long as the last one. On the ground, it&#8217;s 4.5 minutes,” Caspi says, “In the air, we&#8217;re going to get 6.5 minutes per airplane.”</p>



<p>If all goes well, he says, they could also discover some asteroids thought to exist within the orbit of Mercury, which are difficult to detect without the moon blocking the sun’s glare.</p>

<p>Astronomer Shadia Habbal of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu is leading a team that will fly updated cameras and spectrometers on the jets as well. She’s also setting up ground-based observations at sites in Mexico, Texas and Arkansas.</p>



<p>Habbal is even planning to send a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/clouds-for-your-eclipse-nasa-experiment-will-fly-kite-to-rise-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spectrometer four kilometers aloft on a kite</a> from a location near Kerrville, Texas, to get above any clouds that might block the view. The spectrometer collects light from the sun to determine the composition of material in the corona. “There are changes in the corona that occur on time scales of seconds to minutes to hours,” she says. “So the longer duration [of the eclipse] also enables us to capture [more] time variable events and their impact on the corona and solar wind.”</p>



<p>Other repeat experiments include weather balloons that will <a href="https://eclipse.montana.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure waves of pressure</a> in the atmosphere that ripple away from the passing shadow of the eclipse. And a newly redesigned spectrometer will <a href="https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=fts-2021-FTh2G.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ride aboard a Gulfstream jet</a> chasing the eclipse over Texas.</p>



<p>There’s also a number of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/citizen-scientists-2024-solar-eclipse">new or improved ways that amateurs can contribute to the effort</a>, including helping make an eclipse megamovie by taking pictures of the event (<em>SN: 10/18/23</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">An astronomical event to remember</h4>



<p>Once this year’s eclipse wraps up, that will be it for North America for a while. In 2033, Alaska will get an exclusive show in the western part of the state — which might partly make up for it having the worst seat in the house, as far as U.S. states go, this time around. (Only a sliver of the state will be within range to see a portion of the sun covered up.) After that, there will be an eclipse primarily over Canada in 2044, and another that will cross the United States and eastern South America in 2045.</p>



<p>While the astronomical event on April 8 will be both livelier and longer than many eclipses, Habbal says that it doesn’t diminish the importance of studying other eclipses. “Every total solar eclipse yields new discoveries.”</p>



<p>If you’re one of the lucky tens of millions of people who will have a chance to enjoy totality in person, or among of the hundreds of millions within range of the partial eclipse, this is an astronomical event you won’t want to miss.</p>

<p>When Jure Mur, a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, realized the replication of a published study he was working on as a “sanity check” wasn’t producing matching results, his first reaction was “annoyance,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He assumed the mistake was his own, and he’d have to thoroughly check his work to find it. “Only after double- and triple-checking my code did I start suspecting an error in the original paper,” Mur told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mur emailed the authors of the article several times, but they never responded to him, he said. He next contacted the editors of <em>The Lancet Public Health</em>, which had published the original paper, “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00048-8/">Association between hearing aid use and all-cause and cause-specific dementia: an analysis of the UK Biobank cohort</a>,” in April 2023. </p>



<span id="more-128509"></span>



<p>In months of back-and-forth correspondence, seen by Retraction Watch, Mur explained the discrepancies he’d found, then submitted a comment article the editors declined to publish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper was retracted in December, but only after Mur pushed the editors to consider the implications of the authors’ response to his comment, which confirmed his findings and contradicted their original paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The end result is positive for the scientific community,” Mur said. But because the editors seemed to address the issue he raised only after he and his colleagues submitted a comment article, and “either did not read or did not understand the response to our comment,” he said the experience “made me doubt the integrity of the editorial process at the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the high praise the article received when it was first published, the analysis should be corrected and republished, not just retracted, said <a href="https://wagner.nyu.edu/community/faculty/jan-blustein">Jan Blustein</a>, a professor at New York University who studies hearing loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was declared to be the final word, and it’s apparently not,” she said. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <em>Lancet Public Health</em> article made international headlines when it appeared, from <a href="http://ct.moreover.com/?a=50515650229&amp;p=1pl&amp;v=1&amp;x=eQPpZIlK4WeBZ4IzoWqEng"><em>Der Spiegel</em></a><em> </em>to <a href="http://ct.moreover.com/?a=50511418435&amp;p=1pl&amp;v=1&amp;x=V03Qt0bPVGUkM04wL4uOGQ">CNN</a> (also in <a href="http://ct.moreover.com/?a=50513504364&amp;p=1pl&amp;v=1&amp;x=j_VvpNmtQJp0HPhB_LlPCQ">Spanish</a>) to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11970303/Hearing-aids-lower-risk-dementia-Lancet-study-suggests.html"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a>. (CNN has added an update about the retraction to their story and removed references to the study.) It has been cited 15 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In people with hearing loss,” the authors wrote, “hearing aid use is associated with a risk of dementia of a similar level to that of people without hearing loss.” They proposed “up to 8% of dementia cases could be prevented with proper hearing loss management.”</p>



<p>In a simultaneously published <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00058-0/fulltext">editorial</a>–now also <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00302-X/fulltext">retracted</a>–other researchers wrote that with the addition of the article’s data, “the evidence that hearing aids can be a powerful tool to reduce the risk of dementia in people with hearing loss is as good as possible without randomised controlled trials.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mur and his colleagues intended to build on the article with a related analysis on the same UK Biobank data. But when he couldn’t replicate the main findings, Mur scrutinized the paper more deeply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In mid-May, Mur emailed the corresponding author, <a href="https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/zhudongshan/en/index.htm">Dongshan Zhu</a> of Shandong University in Jinan, China. He wrote that he “had some questions regarding your analysis” and asked whether he should direct them to Zhu or the first author of the paper. Mur followed up several times, but Zhu never responded, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mur also emailed the editors of <em>The Lancet Public Health</em> in late May, asking if they would share any other authors’ email addresses they had. He explained that he’d been having trouble replicating some of the findings in the paper, and the corresponding author hadn’t responded to his emails. One of the editors supplied the email address for another author, Chengchao Zhou, also affiliated with Shandong University. Mur’s emails to Zhou went unanswered as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the editors’ suggestion, Mur sent another email to Zhu and Zhou in June asking if they would share their code, and copied the editors. After again getting no response, Mur sent the editors a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1_discrepancy_doc.docx.pdf">document</a> detailing the discrepancies between his replication attempt and the results in the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most notably, he found that hearing aid use did not correspond to a lower rate of dementia for people with hearing loss, as the authors reported. He found the opposite: among people with hearing loss, the dementia rate was higher for those using hearing aids. In his email to the editors, Mur wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Without comparing the code to clean and analyse the data, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about what is going on. But I think it&#8217;s worth trying to resolve it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In July, Audrey Ceschia, editor in chief of <em>The Lancet Public Health</em>, responded. She wrote that the journal had been “notified of an error in the paper” and was currently working with the authors on a correction that “might also help resolving some of the discrepancies you’ve noticed.” She said she would share the correction when it was ready, and also suggested Mur could submit his findings to the journal’s correspondence section. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mur and a few colleagues submitted a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2_comment_article.docx.pdf">comment article</a> to the journal in October, formally explaining the differences in their findings and the published paper, with a link to a repository of their code. In mid-November Ceschia sent Mur the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3.1_author_response.pdf">authors’ response</a> (with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3.2_author_code.pdf">code</a> they provided), but wrote that the journal had “decided not to publish the exchange of letters.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors’ response noted they had “found some discrepancies between coding schemes” and described a new analysis they’d run on the data. They reported on “the relationship between self-reported hearing loss, hearing aid use and risk of dementia,” as they had in their original paper, as well as an additional analysis on people who had severe hearing loss as measured with a hearing test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In supplementary material, the authors presented results in line with what Mur and his colleagues found, but contradicting their originally published work:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Using self-reported hearing loss (no severity information), we found that in people with hearing loss, both using and not using [hearing aids] was linked to an increased risk of all-cause dementia, with HR (95% CI) of (1.47, 1.33-1.63) and (1.17, 1.09-1.25) respectively, i.e., using [hearing aids] had even higher risk of dementia</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mur responded to the journal editors, pointing out that this result “is exactly what we found, reported, and submitted as a comment to the Lancet Public Health and is contrary to the findings published by Jiang et al. (2023). Only in some of the supplementary analyses that were not part of that original published paper, do the authors find a confirmation of their original claim.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In my understanding of scientific integrity, it should now be the authors to retract the article based on these new analyses, or at least publish a major correction which includes a reinterpretation of findings in light of the extended analyses. Since they apparently do not intend to do so, we would now expect the publisher to take action and at least publish our comment (if you don’t plan on retracting the paper either). Please also note that the manuscript is a comment, not a correspondence piece. You may recall that we tried to have a correspondence with the authors and only decided to write a comment after multiple attempts were not successful..</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next day, Anika Knuppel, senior editor at the journal, responded that the editors were “looking into this.” A few weeks later, in early December, Ceschia wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Please accept our profound thanks for prompting us to investigate the reliability of the paper by Fan Jiang et al. To summarise an extensive series of exchanges with the authors, they have now explained that they have discovered analytical errors in their work that render their findings and conclusions false and misleading. We have taken the decision to retract their paper and will publish the retraction notice next week. We are very grateful to you for bringing your concerns to us directly and we are pleased to be able to correct the scientific record in a timely manner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On December 12, <em>The Lancet Public Health </em>editors published the following <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(22)00314-0/fulltext">retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>On Nov 27, 2023, we have been informed by the authors of the paper—Association between hearing aid use and all-cause and cause-specific dementia: an analysis of the UK Biobank cohort—published on April 13, 2023,1 that an error was introduced in the output format setting of their SAS codes (data for people with hearing loss using hearing aids and with hearing loss without using hearing aids were switched), leading to errors in their analysis which render their findings and conclusions false and misleading. These errors were identified by the authors following an exchange with scientists seeking to reproduce the authors&#8217; findings. We are therefore retracting this Article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked Zhu why he and his colleagues had not requested a retraction once their reanalysis found different results than their original paper. He responded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Thanks for your attention to our research.</p>



<p>If the output formats were not mis-defined, using self-reported hearing loss, people with hearing loss using HA had 34% higher risk of dementia, and people with hearing loss not using HA had 7% higher risk dementia [sic].</p>



<p>We believe there are two prominent bias [sic] when self-reported hearing loss was used, i.e., self-reported bias, and hearing loss severity bias.</p>



<p>In the next step, we will try to control for self-report bias and severity bias to see the effect of wearing hearing aids after bias control on reducing the risk of dementia, especially in people with severe hearing loss.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When we reached out to Ceschia and Knuppel, we heard back from a spokesperson for <em>The Lancet</em>. Regarding the authors’ response to Mur and colleagues’ comment, the spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While acknowledging “some discrepancies between coding systems”, they argued that “The overall message of the study did not change.” In good faith, we accepted the authors’ explanation, and decided not to publish the exchange. In retrospect, we should have followed up the admitted discrepancies more assiduously and worked with the authors and Dr Mur to settle any outstanding uncertainties. Dr Mur rightly challenged our decision in an email on November 16. We immediately recognised the seriousness of his concerns and wrote again to the authors on November 22 asking them to further clarify their analyses, based on Dr Mur’s evidence and our own by now heightened unease. On November 24, the authors reported major errors in their paper, which rendered their findings and conclusions false and misleading. We moved quickly to retract the paper on December 12, 2023.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When the paper first appeared, it seemed to confirm a widely held belief – that hearing loss is associated with developing dementia, and using hearing aids can help to reduce risk – about which the scientific evidence has been mixed, Blustein, the hearing loss researcher, told Retraction Watch. In <a href="https://www.sac-oac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hearing-loss-and-dementia-Blustein-Weinstein-Chodosh.pdf">her view</a>, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2808841">public health messaging</a> and media coverage of the question has been “misleading.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings were picked up quickly and disseminated among the community of people following the question of hearing loss and dementia, she said. “I don’t think people are necessarily aware of retractions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analysis should be corrected, and if <em>The Lancet Public Health </em>were to receive a new version, they should publish it, Blustein said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK Biobank dataset “is a very valuable data source,” she said. The dataset’s large size, long followup period, and information about potentially confounding factors made the article an important piece of evidence. “To throw away data because somebody miscoded it is a mistake.”</p>



<p>Blustein also felt that the retraction notice was unclear about what readers should take away from the study, and the lack of clarity was “another reason why the record is incomplete” without a replacement analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the retraction notice was “technically correct,” Mur said, it did “obfuscate the fact that it was primarily my colleagues and I &#8211; not the journal or the authors of the original paper &#8211; who identified a problem and invested plenty of time and effort to have it rectified.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To other researchers trying to correct the record, he advised:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Be prepared for an uphill battle. In our case, the editors were always courteous and quick to respond to our emails but notifying them of the discrepancies and detailing them in a short report was not sufficient. We still had to write and submit a paper before any substantial action by the journal was evident.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But putting forth the effort was important, he said, “simply because we knew the results were erroneous.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The study had been mentioned in several media articles, featured in an editorial by the journal, and hailed by some in the field as the most definitive evidence on the topic one can get without performing a clinical trial. You can&#8217;t let that stand if you know it to be false.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-salt-carved-terrains-glacier-features">Salt may have carved out Mercury’s terrains, including glacierlike features</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mercury’s surface might not be quite so terra firma, at least on geologic timescales.</p>



<p>The closest planet to the sun is a world sculpted by volatiles — ephemeral compounds that can freeze, flow or float into space over time, analogous to water on Earth. Salt, the primary volatile on Mercury, appears to have reshuffled the planet’s landscape over billions of years and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/acf219?fbclid=IwAR0zG0pk6PwJCsm1sBxHLF7QPK83CoMMa5rmjDScoDrajnNFY6P9xRVw-tI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might even flow — very slowly — in glacier</a><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/acf219?fbclid=IwAR0zG0pk6PwJCsm1sBxHLF7QPK83CoMMa5rmjDScoDrajnNFY6P9xRVw-tI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like landforms</a>, researchers report in the November <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>. The volatile could possibly even form habitable niches deep underground, the authors speculate.</p>



<p>Scientists have long suspected that many of Mercury’s signature terrains have been shaped by volcanic debris from deep within the planet. Instead, “volatile-driven resurfacing on Mercury has been one of the major engines in the evolution of the landscape,” says Alexis Rodriguez, a space research scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.</p>



<p>Until relatively recently, researchers thought Mercury couldn’t even harbor such salts. The planet sits so close to the sun that scientists assumed the compounds would either be baked off or stripped away by the solar wind. But when NASA’s Messenger spacecraft circled the planet in the early 2010s, the probe detected <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/messages-mercury-0">unmistakable signs of volatiles</a> (<em>SN: 6/17/11</em>).</p>



<p>The sun-scorched world has done more than cling to them, the new study proposes. It has stockpiled them in abundance throughout Mercury’s crust, possibly in a planetwide cache. Those volatiles might in turn be responsible for carving two common geologic features: chaotic terrains and glacierlike flows.</p>



<p>Mercury’s surface is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-stunning-landscape-mapped">jumble of hills, plateaus and grooves</a> (<em>SN: 5/10/16</em>). Previous theories suggested that long-ago volcanic outbursts were primarily responsible for the chaotic terrain. But that doesn’t jibe with where the terrains are found, say Rodriguez and colleagues.</p>



<p>If volcanic outbursts had formed the messy landscape, they would have preferentially erased certain preexisting geologic features, such as smaller impact craters, over others. But there are plenty of chaotic terrains that harbor ghosts of craters big and small that collapsed long ago, the researchers point out. They think the crater-preserving chaotic terrains formed another way: from volatiles in the ground leaking into space, such that the land loses structural integrity and collapses like a Jenga tower. The team previously proposed this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59885-5" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59885-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happened elsewhere on the planet</a>. </p>

<p>In the new study, a close analysis of features at the planet’s north pole suggests similar sculpting done by salts. And there’s possibly even more evidence for volatile sculpting in the basins of &nbsp;asteroid craters — formations that look like “glaciers” made of salt. The structures appear as oozing blobs in photos from the Messenger probe and probably formed over the eons after asteroids hit the planet’s surface and exposed buried volatiles, the team proposes. The heat of the impact — reaching several hundred degrees Celsius — mobilizes the underlying volatiles in the crust to trudge towards lower ground and pool like thick syrup, Rodriguez explains.</p>



<p>Like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stunning-images-reveal-glacial-landscapes-under-oceans">Earth’s glaciers</a>, these slow-moving land masses <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stunning-images-reveal-glacial-landscapes-under-oceans">carve up the land </a>wherever they flow, the researchers say (<em>SN: 5/12/17</em>). Divots tens of meters deep pockmark their surface, indicating that the salt glaciers are losing volatiles into Mercury’s tenuous atmosphere. After a billion years, the formations might disappear altogether.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="621" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121823_sek_mercury_inline2.jpg?resize=680%2C621&#038;ssl=1" alt="Mercury feature resembling glaciers" class="wp-image-3134724" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121823_sek_mercury_inline2.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121823_sek_mercury_inline2.jpg?resize=419%2C383&amp;ssl=1 419w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121823_sek_mercury_inline2.jpg?resize=493%2C450&amp;ssl=1 493w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121823_sek_mercury_inline2.jpg?resize=204%2C186&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121823_sek_mercury_inline2.jpg?resize=635%2C580&amp;ssl=1 635w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134724">Mercury has globular geological structures that resemble glacier flows (several marked in this Messenger image).

Rodriguez et al/The Planetary Science Journal 2023 and Carnegie Institution of Washington, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Interestingly, the ubiquity of surface volatiles (and their geologic effects) suggests there’s a lot more lurking underground. Rodriguez and colleagues estimate that a volatile-rich layer in the planet’s crust can run up to several kilometers deep. That’s thick enough to fashion pockets of habitability to potentially shelter hardy critters from the extreme temperatures on Mercury’s surface, the team argues.</p>



<p>Whether life could survive there in theory or not, the mere presence of glaciers on Mercury is in itself surprising. If Mercury’s geologic features do, in fact, count as glaciers, that means they’re common throughout our solar system, from the sun’s closest neighbor to the farthest dwarf, Pluto.</p>



<p>However, other scientists say the “glacier” label is moot. The “glaciers” could contain more rocky material than volatiles, says Sean Solomon, a retired planetary scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., and the principal investigator of the Messenger mission. So perhaps the landforms are more like landslides lubricated by volatiles. Still, he says, the study’s argument for how the structures formed is plausible.</p>



<p>The new ideas are radical, notes David Rothery, a planetary scientist at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England. “But it all fits the pattern: Mercury is surprisingly rich in volatiles, and we have yet to understand the limits of what the volatiles are able to do to Mercury&#8217;s landscape.” A revisit with more advanced instruments than Messenger’s is very much in order, Rothery says.</p>



<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">BepiColombo</a>, a joint endeavor between the European and Japanese space agencies, is on the way <em>(SN: 1/15/21</em>)<em>.</em> Launched in 2018, the spacecraft will enter Mercury’s orbit in December 2025. “BepiColombo, as well as answering some of those questions, is going to give us some more surprises,” says Rothery, who is involved with the mission. “I&#8217;d be very surprised if we are not surprised.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-fruit-display-collapse">Here’s how much fruit you can take from a display before it collapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you take more than 10 percent of the fruit in a stacked produce display — watch out.</p>



<p>The iconic sloped produce displays in grocery stores can cause chaos when they collapse. But the question of how much fruit can be removed before the structure comes tumbling down is surprisingly complicated. A new study, published in the December <em>Physical Review E</em>, finally <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.064904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides an answer</a>.</p>



<p>Fruit display collapses are a good system for studying <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-avalanches">the dynamics that produce avalanches</a> and landslides because they’re relatively simple, says physicist Eduardo Rojas of the University of Antofagasta in Chile (<em>SN: 1/4/16</em>). All the objects are arranged in a nonrandom, crystallike form and are roughly the same size and shape — unlike the earth of a mountainside, for instance. This makes it easier to examine the impact of removing one object on the overall structure.</p>



<p>Using computer simulations, Rojas and colleagues modeled fruit stacked at many different angles to identify when a collapse would never happen and when one would happen instantly. In between those extremes, the team&nbsp;simulated what would happen to the integrity of the display when more and more fruit was removed.</p>



<p>About 10 percent of the fruit in a given display can be removed before triggering an avalanche, the simulations suggest. If 29 shoppers grabbed an apple from a stack of 300, the next shopper might want to put on a hard hat before plucking one for themselves.</p>



<p>“Their&nbsp;simulations certainly seem to have some of the hallmarks of our everyday&nbsp;experience,” says Arshad Kudrolli, a physicist at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. “It is a nice approach&nbsp;and can be generalized easily.”</p>



<p>Rojas and colleagues next hope to simulate angled stacks of objects of different sizes that are randomly arranged, like piles of rocks that could lead to dangerous rockslides.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-fossils-oldest-machinery-photosynthesis-thylakoids">Bacteria fossils hold the oldest signs of machinery needed for photosynthesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient tiny fossils from Australia may carry evidence of great power: the ability to make oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>



<p>The fossilized bacteria, dating from 1.73 billion to 1.78 billion years ago, are chock-full of structures that resemble those where oxygen-producing photosynthesis takes place in most modern cyanobacteria and in plants. Called thylakoid membranes, the structures are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06896-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the oldest ever found</a>, researchers report January 3 in <em>Nature</em>. The finding pushes back the evidence of thylakoids in cyanobacteria by 1.2 billion years.</p>



<p>Cyanobacteria’s invention of photosynthesis is responsible for the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. &#8220;So they&#8217;re a big deal,” says Woodward Fischer, a geobiologist at Caltech who was not involved finding the thylakoid membranes. And “this is the kind of information that I thought we were not going to be able to pull out of fossils,” he says.</p>



<p>Most fossils preserve mineralized tissues such as bone or shells, but bacteria don’t contain such mineral structures. These fossils are “just compressions of carbon” squished into mud, Fischer says. To find the bacteria preserved is impressive enough, but the new fossils reveal complex structures inside the microscopic bacteria. “It suggests this kind of future where we might be able to pull more information, more cell biology and morphological detail out of these minuscule fossils,” he says.</p>



<p>Researchers already had indirect evidence from genetics and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-got-first-whiff-oxygen-32-billion-years-ago">chemical studies</a> that cyanobacteria had developed thylakoids by the time these fossilized bacteria lived, says Patricia Sanchez-Baracaldo, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Bristol in England <em>(SN: 9/8/15)</em>. Still, exactly when the structures evolved is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/origin-photosynthesis-may-go-further-back-estimates-50-years-ago">hotly debated</a> (<em>SN: 3/2/17</em>). So it’s exciting to see fossil evidence of such old thylakoids, says Sanchez-Baracaldo, who was not involved in the work. “Any evidence that you have from that time period is important because the fossil record is really very sparse.”</p>



<p>Some researchers think that thylakoids may have evolved before the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-might-not-have-needed-major-event-become-oxygen-rich">Great Oxidation Event</a> around 2.4 billion years ago (<em>SN: 12/11/19</em>). Prior to that event, there were whiffs of oxygen here and there in the atmosphere, but it took the concentrated action of photosynthetic bacteria to send Earth’s oxygen levels skyrocketing. Stacks of thylakoids within cyanobacteria may have multiplied the bacteria’s oxygen production.</p>



<p>During the period when the now-fossilized cyanobacteria lived, oxygen levels in Earth’s atmosphere had plummeted again to a fraction of today’s levels, Sanchez-Baracaldo says. The fossils hint that there may have been small pockets where oxygen was abundant and could have fostered the evolution of the ancestors of plants and animals.</p>



<p>Many rocks that might harbor such fossils have been compressed and “cooked” destroying delicate intracellular structures like thylakoids, says Emmanuelle Javaux, an astrobiologist at the University of Liège in Belgium.</p>



<p>“We didn&#8217;t know that they could be preserved in such old microfossils,” she says. But she has no doubt that the dark lines stacked through tiny sausage-shaped cells represent thylakoids. “It cannot be something else, actually. This arrangement is very unique to cyanobacteria with thylakoids,” she says.</p>

<p>Javaux and colleagues found the oldest thylakoid-like structures in microfossils in shale from Australia. The structures were also present in about 1 billion-year-old fossils from Canada, but not in 1 billion-year-old ones from Congo. The rocks from Congo experienced slightly higher temperatures than the others, which may have destroyed fossil evidence of thylakoids. Or maybe those fossils are cyanobacteria that never evolved the structures or are another type of microbe entirely.</p>



<p>The researchers can’t tell from the fossils whether the Australian and Canadian cyanobacteria are direct ancestors of living species, Javaux says, but they are almost certainly cousins. The team hopes to investigate even older rocks from before the Great Oxidation Event for even more ancient evidence of thylakoids.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/morning-sickness-pregnancy-nausea-vomiting-fetus-protein">Fetuses make a protein that causes morning sickness in pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surge of a hormone made by fetuses triggers the stomach-turning nausea and vomiting of morning sickness, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>People who have naturally low levels of the protein in their blood before pregnancy are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06921-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more susceptible to a severe form of morning sickness</a> called hyperemesis gravidarum when hit with the rush of protein, researchers report December 13 in <em>Nature</em>. The findings could help identify people at risk of the severe illness and lead to treatments.</p>



<p>Up to 80 percent of pregnant people get nauseous in the early stages of pregnancy, and about half vomit — a combo of symptoms often called (misleadingly) morning sickness. A small percentage of pregnant people — up to 3 percent — will develop hyperemesis gravidarum, vomiting so severe and frequent it can lead to weight loss, dehydration and even hospitalization and death of the fetus or mother.</p>



<p>Previously, researchers speculated morning sickness is caused by estrogen or other hormones that are elevated early in pregnancy, says gynecologist and obstetrician Jone Trovik, who was not involved in the study. For severe sickness, she says, studies implicated elevated thyroid hormone, infections and other causes.</p>



<p>“Most problematic has been that it has been considered to be a psychological cause, which has been widely refuted,” says Trovik, of Haukeland University hospital and the University of Bergen in Norway. “Women have been told, &#8216;Maybe you don&#8217;t want this pregnancy. Maybe you&#8217;re angry with your husband.&#8217;”</p>



<p>The new findings, Trovik says, provide “evidence that this is a real disease.”</p>



<p>Patients who had nausea and vomiting during pregnancy had higher levels of a protein called GDF15 in their blood than pregnant people without the symptoms, endocrinologist Stephen O’Rahilly of Cambridge University and colleagues report. That protein, which is made throughout the body and helps cells respond to stress, was previously found to act on a part of the brain involved in producing nausea and vomiting.</p>



<p>Study coauthor Marlena Fejzo and colleagues had already shown that people with a certain genetic variant in the <em>GDF15</em> gene have up to 10 times the risk of developing hyperemesis gravidarum than people without the variant. But those with the variant produce <em>less</em> GDF15 than is typical, those researchers discovered.</p>



<p>That finding was a conundrum, says Fejzo, a geneticist and hyperemesis gravidarum researcher at the Keck School of Medicine of USC in Los Angeles. If people with the variant produce low levels of GDF15, but high levels are associated with nausea and vomiting, why is the variant a risk for severe morning sickness?</p>



<p>Turns out that people with the risk variant make less of the protein before pregnancy, but have elevated levels of GDF15 in their blood when pregnant. The twist is that most of the GDF15 produced in pregnancy comes from the fetus and placenta, the study’s researchers found. People with the risk variant aren’t used to GDF15’s sick-making effects. “So when you&#8217;re met with those high levels in early pregnancy, you&#8217;re highly sensitive to them, more than the average person,” Fejzo says.</p>



<p>Conversely, people with a rare blood disorder called beta thalassemia have high levels of GDF15. Those people rarely get queasy during pregnancy, the researchers found. That finding suggested that exposure to the protein before pregnancy might desensitize people so they don’t become so sick.</p>



<p>The team tested the idea in mice. Rodents that got a big dose of the protein cut back on eating, something the animals typically do when nauseous. But if the mice got prepped for the surge with a lesser dose of long-acting GDF15 three days beforehand, they weren’t bothered as much. The result suggests that small amounts of the protein can blunt the effect of a bigger dose later.</p>



<p>All the findings together also suggest avenues for treatment. The diabetes drug metformin raises GDF15 levels and might be given to people at risk of hyperemesis gravidarum before pregnancy, O’Rahilly says. Or, future drugs may be developed to block the action of GDF15 on the brain.</p>



<p>Fejzo notes one caveat, though: Most of the genetic studies were done with people of European descent, so it&#8217;s not certain that GDF15 is a major player for all ethnic groups.</p>



<p>Also, gastroenterologist Sumona Saha says that before any treatment can be given, researchers will need <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-medication-new-drugs-research-clinical-trials">plenty of safety data</a> from animal studies (<em>SN: 4/21/22</em>). No one really knows what effect blocking GDF15 may have on fetal development or if raising levels of the protein before pregnancy could affect conception, says Saha, of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison.</p>



<p>Currently, doctors try a variety of antinausea medications, neurological drugs and other therapies, sometimes including intravenous fluids and nutrition to treat people with severe nausea and vomiting. Having therapies focused on GDF15 may improve treatment, Saha says.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve got, potentially, a very targeted therapy versus a lot of other treatments, which are like taking a hammer to a problem. Now, we potentially will have an X-Acto knife that we can use.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/self-control-willpower-psychology">Most people say self-control is the same as willpower. Researchers disagree</a></h4>

              
                <p>A scientific squabble over how to define self-control draws from an unlikely source: A story from Greek mythology.</p>



<p>Sailing home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, Odysseus longed to hear the Sirens’ legendary song. But he knew that was a very bad idea. The Sirens, the goddess Circe had warned, lured passing sailors to their island to kill them. So Circe helped Odysseus form a plan. As his boat approached the Sirens’ island, Odysseus handed crew members balls of wax to plug their ears, and he ordered the men to tie him firmly to the boat’s mast. He told the crew to tie him tighter if he begged and pleaded to heed the Sirens&#8217; call. His plan in place, Odysseus was able to both hear the Sirens and live to tell the tale. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The science is clear. Proverbially tying oneself to the mast — or crafting strategies in advance to thwart temptation — is the optimal way to meet one’s goals. But not all agree that such preemptive strategies constitute self-control.</p>



<p>Social psychologists say Odysseus utilized exemplary self-control. That’s because they tend to distinguish between strategic self-control — that is, the Odysseus approach — and willpower. Willpower would be akin to Odysseus resisting the Sirens’ call in the moment without rope and muscular crewmen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some social scientists, though, have started to push back against that linguistic split. Most laypeople use both <em>willpower </em>and <em>self-control</em> to refer to resisting temptation in the moment, says Chandra Sripada, a psychiatric neuroscientist and philosopher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. As such, they view Odysseus’ decision to tie himself to the mast not as an act of self-control but an admission that he lacked it.</p>



<p>“The Odysseus case is a vivid example of how precommitment, preplanning and things like that aren’t called by ordinary people <em>self-control</em>,” Sripada says.</p>



<p>Ivory tower infighting over what does, and does not, constitute self-control might seem like a battle with low stakes. Experts largely agree that preemptive planning is the best way to achieve one’s goals. So who cares if that route to success reflects self-control or something else? All roads, after all, lead to Ithaca.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issue does matter, Sripada insists. Consider this festive time of year. Social scientists often appear in the media as experts who can help people achieve their New Year’s resolutions. But if those experts are speaking a different language than their audience, their message may not sink in.</p>



<p>And people are truly terrible at meeting their resolutions. One survey found that roughly 40 percent of people in the United States make resolutions, but <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-12/urban_plates_-_nyr_survey_key_findings_12-8-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than half complete that resolution</a> by year’s end. Roughly a third of resolution-setters don’t make it past the three-month mark. Another survey showed that most adult Americans think they’ll fail at their resolutions due to, you guessed it, <a href="https://www.finder.com/new-years-resolution-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lack of willpower</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of it this way, Sripada says: If he told his patients to exercise self-control to avoid sweets, they would think he meant resisting the immediate craving to eat a freshly baked cookie. They would not think he meant taking the long route home to avoid driving past the bakery.</p>



<p>“You have to communicate with people using a familiar vocabulary,” Sripada says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Odysseus-izing self-control</h4>



<p>In recent years, psychological terms have been infiltrating everyday speech. In the process, words like <em>gaslighting</em>, <em>triggered</em>, <em>narcissistic</em>, <em>toxic</em>, <em>traumatized</em> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-languishing-psychology-covid"><em>flourishing</em></a> have become diluted and imprecise (<em>SN: 1/10/23</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The term <em>self-control</em> shows that similar mistranslations also occur in reverse. The idea of self-control emerged thousands of years ago. For instance, in <em>The</em> <em>Laws, </em>a book delving into political philosophy, ethics, theology and psychology, Plato asserted that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-021-00573-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-control compensated for a lack of strategic planning</a>, researchers wrote in the March 2023 <em>Review of Philosophy and Psychology.</em></p>



<p>By comparison, scientists entered the self-control discourse relatively recently. Other concepts, such as attention, memory, motivation and desire, have followed a similar trajectory from lay discourse to scientific jargon, says philosopher and cognitive scientist Juan Pablo Bermúdez, a coauthor on the study. “Once [these words] come into the science, they change. Sometimes they change for the better. Sometimes they get muddier. [Self-control] seems to be a case of the latter,” says Bermúdez, of the Universidad Externado de Colombia in Bogota.</p>



<p>To be clear, scientists’ hearts are in the right place. In the early aughts, it was known that people reporting high levels of inner self-control — as measured by responses to questions such as, “I am good at resisting temptations” or “I get carried away by my feelings” — tended to report higher levels of well-being and academic achievement and more stable relationships than the general public. Scientists assumed that people strong in self-control were simply better than others at muscling through temptation. How, they wanted to know, could others strengthen that muscle?</p>



<p>But then research began to emerge that challenged that framework. In one study, researchers analyzed the results of about 100 self-control studies of almost 33,000 participants. People who scored high in self-control were no better than others at resisting temptation in the moment, those scientists reported in the February 2012 <em>Personality and Social Psychology Review.</em> Instead, such individuals reported having <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088868311418749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established habits</a> or routines.</p>



<p>In another study, researchers pinged over 200 people on beepers several times a day to measure their desires in real time. Individuals who scored high in self-control reported <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22149456/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiencing less temptation and weaker desires</a> than those with lower scores, the team reported in the June 2012 <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.</em></p>



<p>Those studies led to a seismic shift in the field of self-control, says social psychologist Malte Friese of Saarlund University in Saarbrücken, Germany, who was not involved in that work. “Apparently the people who are good in self-control … don’t inhibit all day long. They do something different.”</p>



<p>Thus began the willpower/self-control split. Scientists began exploring the tools that could help people do those different things — while sticking to the moniker “self-control.” Some research focused on strategies people could call on in the moment to move beyond simple willpower to resist temptation, says Kentaro Fujita, a social psychologist at the Ohio State University in Columbus. For instance, research has shown that distracting oneself or focusing on the negative aspects of a temptation can help people overcome immediate desires.</p>



<p>But with evidence mounting that preplanning à la Odysseus presented the key to long-term success, that’s where researchers focused their attention, says Fujita, who outlined those strategies in the October 2020 <em>Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em>. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2372732220941242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some tips</a> include linking goal failure to a self-imposed punishment, such as forcing oneself to donate to a loathed organization. Another involves bundling a disliked action — say, running — with a desirable one, such as listening to a favorite podcast.</p>



<p>“This article challenges a common belief: that successful self-control requires willpower,” Fujita and his coauthors wrote.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Commoners missed the memo</h4>



<p>But Sripada’s research shows that people who aren’t regularly designing or participating in research studies don’t disentangle the terms <em>willpower</em> and <em>self-control</em>. His team <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027722001421?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested how people think about self-control</a> in a study published in the August 2022 <em>Cognition</em>.</p>



<p>In one experiment, the team sought to replicate the Odysseus story through a different tale, this one about a man named Mo and his desire to eat less cheese. The researchers had 86 online participants read one of several vignettes. In one scenario — a counterpart to the “tying himself to the mast” story — Mo gives his block of cheddar to a roommate so that he won’t eat it later. Despite begging and pleading for his cheese the next day, the roommate denies his request.</p>



<p>In an alternate scenario, Mo doesn’t preemptively hand off the cheese. Instead, when the roommate asks if she can use his block of cheddar to make a sandwich, Mo gives it to her despite wanting it for himself, thus overriding his strong craving. That is, he resists the cheese’s Siren call.</p>



<p>The team then asked participants: “How much self-control did Mo exercise in order not to eat cheese?” Respondents could answer from 1 for “none” to 7 for “a lot.” Participants rated Mo high in self-control when he gave his roommate the cheese in the moment, the team found. But, they rated him low in self-control when he “begged and pleaded” for the cheese the next day. In other words, lay people have not received social psychologists’ memo that strategic planning constitutes self-control — and not just any self-control but the best kind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study shows that self-control researchers have not done enough to investigate laypeople’s understanding of self-control, says Friese, who was not involved with the study. “We have our own terminology and we are doing research based on that terminology, but it’s not really aligned with what laypeople may think.”</p>



<p>That mismatch makes it hard for scientists to communicate the power of preemptive strategies to the public. But expanding the meaning of self-control might also be making it hard for scientists to communicate with each other. “There is no [scientific] consensus on what self-control is and what it is not,” Fujita says. “Depending on who you talk to and depending on their theoretical vantage point, they might be using the same word to mean very different things.”</p>



<p>Psychologists’ expansion of the term <em>self-control</em> runs counter to thousands of years of language use, Sripada says. Researchers, and the public they hope to reach, would be better off finding another term to describe the superior, preemptive, tie-yourself-to-the-mast strategies. And they can stick to the original idea of self-control as equivalent to resisting temptation in the moment, or willpower.</p>



<p>With that in mind, Sripada suggests an alternate phrasing when communicating to people about how to achieve their New Year’s resolutions: “Do you want to keep your New Year’s resolutions? Then don’t rely on self-control. That is a sucker’s game.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-toxic-gas-life-moon-robot">A toxic gas that could help spawn life has been found on Enceladus</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO </strong>— For those delighted by the possibility of alien life, Enceladus, the wintry moon of Saturn, is a gift that just keeps giving.</p>



<p>Key compounds that could support alien microbes or help life emerge <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1352721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been detected in the enormous plume of water</a> that erupts from vents in Enceladus’ icy shell, biophysicist Jonah Peter of Harvard University reported December 15 at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting. These include hydrogen cyanide, which can be toxic to humans, though Peter noted it’s also “a key building block for synthesizing more complex compounds including amino acids, sugars and nucleobases, which in turn are precursors for proteins, RNA and DNA.”</p>



<p>The findings are good tidings for the NASA team developing the Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor, or EELS, a snakelike robot that could one day crawl into Enceladus’ frozen crust to seek out signs of life in the ocean below.</p>



<p>Though that ocean has never been directly observed, it is thought to be the source of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jwst-enceladus-plume-water-space">huge water plume spouting from Enceladus’ south pole</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/23</em>). Researchers had previously reported that the plume contains phosphorous in the form of phosphate, establishing Enceladus as the first alien ocean world known to possess <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-phosphorus-life-building-block-saturn-moon">all the elements essential for life</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/23</em>). The detection of phosphorus bolstered the moon as a prime candidate for hosting extraterrestrial life, and the new findings from Peter’s team offer even more support.</p>



<p>With hydrogen cyanide and phosphate, “Enceladus might be seen as a favorable prebiotic system,” or a chemical setting capable of giving rise to life, said Christopher Glein, a geochemist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Peter and colleagues conducted a detailed analysis of data collected by NASA’s Cassini probe as it flew through Enceladus’ plume in 2011 and 2012. In addition to hydrogen cyanide, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-02160-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the spray contains acetylene, ethane and various alcohols</a>, the team also reported December 14 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. These compounds fuel some microbes on Earth, Peter said, “and could supply large amounts of metabolic energy for any potential life” on Enceladus.</p>



<p>Though NASA has no missions scheduled for Enceladus, its habitability has already spurred the development of EELS. The 100-kilogram, 4-meter-long robot consists of ringed, cylindrical segments. These pieces can be angled and rotated in different ways to make EELS slither, sidewind or move vertically inside crevasses.</p>

<p>The robot’s <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1276174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent field test</a> occurred in September, on the Athabasca Glacier in Alberta, Canada, reported technologist Masahiro Ono on December 13 at the meeting. On the glacier, Ono, of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and his colleagues tested the vertical mobility of EELS inside three ice shafts, or moulins. The robot first succeeded at holding itself steady in the moulins, unfurling its body to lodge itself between the frozen walls. Then, by carefully rotating treaded rings on its body, EELS safely completed multiple 1.5-meter descents.</p>



<p>Following further tests on the glacier, the next step for EELS might be Earth’s moon. For instance, a small version of the space snake could be deployed to assist stationary lunar landers, Ono said. This robot “is a game changer,” he said, “and not just for Enceladus.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physical-activity-exercise-health-benefits">When it comes to physical activity, every bit counts</a></h4>

              
                <p>We’ve stepped into a new year, which for many people means new resolutions. And this story was supposed to tackle a big one: the best exercise people can do to be healthy.</p>



<p>There’s just one small problem. “There’s simply no such thing as ‘best exercise,’” says Emmanuel Stamatakis, a physical activity epidemiologist at the University of Sydney. If you see a headline like that, he says, it’s probably clickbait.</p>



<p>What scientists do know — from piles of studies spanning 70 years — is that regular physical activity pays off in long-term health benefits. And recent work is starting to paint a clearer picture of all the activities that can help. You don’t have to body build like Arnold Schwarzenegger or crush marathons like Tigst Assefa. And not everyone has the time, money or ability to join a gym or use special equipment. But you don’t need to, Stamatakis says. Biking to the grocery store, raking leaves, playing soccer with your kids — it all counts.</p>



<p>Scientists still have much to figure out, like how physical activity’s benefits cascade through the body and how to empower people to add movement to their daily lives. But at least one conclusion seems clear, says I-Min Lee, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Any physical activity is better than none.”</p>



<p>For Lee, it comes down to finding something you enjoy. That can make the difference between getting off the couch or staying put. “The best physical activity,” she says, “is something that you will do and stick with.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Physical activity can extend your life and offer a slew of other health benefits</h4>



<p>The idea that physical activity is good for you might seem eye-rollingly obvious and peskily pervasive. Fitness influencers post workouts on social media, news reports tout exercise’s benefits and governments worldwide try to get citizens moving.</p>



<p>Still, the <a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States’ current physical activity guidelines</a>, published in 2018, reported that some 80 percent of adults aren’t doing enough. Adults need at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities at least two days per week, the guidelines suggest. (How long should these muscle-strengthening sessions last? “We don’t really know,” Lee says.)</p>



<p>But scientists are learning that even a little physical activity can be helpful, Lee says. Most of the studies underpinning the 2018 recommendations <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2810684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relied on self-reported data</a>, Lee and colleagues wrote in a <em>JAMA</em> opinion piece in October. People tend to remember exercises like running or swimming laps, Lee says. But the myriad movements we take in a typical day — movements that scientists now know can improve health — were difficult to document via self-reports.</p>



<p>Today, wearable technology has yanked those missing movements out of obscurity and into the spotlight. Outfitting participants with tracking devices lets scientists collect mountains of in-depth data throughout a person’s day, such as step count, acceleration and heart rate. That’s helping reveal all the things that physical activity (or the lack of it) can do for people’s health.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>“If you do nothing, just do a little bit. If you already do a little bit, do a little bit more.”</p><cite>I-Min Lee</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In the last year, scientists have shown people who did more physical activity were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9936337/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to be hospitalized for common conditions</a> like gallbladder disease, diabetes and urinary tract infections. These data add to recent survey-based studies and clinical trials linking <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/19/1231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise with lower risk of death due to flu and pneumonia</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10359965/#:~:text=Conclusions%20and%20Relevance,D%20supplementation%20had%20no%20effect." target="_blank" rel="noopener">improvements in memory and attention</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9750896/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better outcomes after a COVID-19 infection</a>.</p>



<p>“Study after study has demonstrated the benefit of physical activity,” says Bryant Webber, a preventative medicine physician at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. His team has shown that it’s never too late to start. In a study of more than 100,000 people age 65 and older, both <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797402?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=101722" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aerobic training and muscle strengthening seemed to lower the risk of dying</a> over the next eight years. Even people older than 85 saw benefits, says Webber, who did the work while at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We were impressed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some people may be getting the benefits of physical activity without realizing it. Stamatakis’ team in Australia studies incidental activity: the typical, routine movements people perform in their daily lives. His team analyzed data from people who don’t exercise in their free time but had worn tracking devices for a week. Just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brief-burst-activity-health-benefits">a minute or two of intense activity</a> — like taking the stairs or dashing to catch a train — a few times per day reduced the risk of dying in the following seven or so years by about 40 percent, Stamatakis and colleagues reported in 2022 <em>(SN: 12/8/22).</em> The more activity, the better, he says. And last year, his team linked just <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2807734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three and a half minutes of daily vigorous activity with a roughly 18 percent reduction in cancer risk</a>.</p>



<p>Walk uphill, carry a heavy grocery basket, “get a little bit out of breath,” Stamatakis says. Any burst of exertion that briefly boosts your heart rate a few times per day could have long term health benefits, he says. That’s something many people don’t understand. In interviews with middle-aged people, Stamatakis has heard a common misconception. “The majority of them still think that you need to go to the gym, otherwise there’s no point.”</p>



<p>Don’t get him wrong, Stamatakis isn’t saying people should skip the gym. “I want to make it absolutely clear that exercise is a fantastic option,” he says. But for people who can’t afford a gym membership or aren’t able or willing to exercise in traditional ways, short bursts of vigorous activities several times per day could be good, too.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Scientists still have questions about exercise, but they know even a little bit helps</h4>



<p>At Harvard, Lee has worked to dispel another popular misconception: that people need to take 10,000 steps every day to stay healthy.</p>



<p>She started looking into the idea in 2018, when her hospital launched a campaign to get employees to walk more. Because Lee studies physical activity, her administrators asked her to form a team. It was mostly middle-aged and older folks, she says. “For some of these people, if you’re asking them to do 10,000 steps — I mean, no way,” she says. “Even doing 5,000 steps is a stretch.”</p>



<p>In 2019, Lee’s team found that older women who took around 8,500 steps per day <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2734709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were 66 percent less likely to die during the study</a> than those who took roughly 2,500 steps per day. In a 2022 analysis, Lee and her colleagues reported something similar in men and women of different ages. Bottom line: For mortality benefits, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people age 60 or older should shoot for 7,000 steps a day, and people younger should shoot for 9,000</a>, she says.</p>



<p>But those targets shouldn’t be discouraging, she says. Lee takes a tiered approach. “If you do nothing, just do a little bit,” she says. “If you already do a little bit, do a little bit more.”</p>



<p>She follows that advice herself. Lee grew up in the tropics in Malaysia, where it was hot, and she didn’t see many people exercising, including herself. “I did diddly-squat,” she laughs. That changed after she came to the United States for her doctorate. “It got to be so embarrassing to do physical activity research without being physically active,” she says. So she started running. “I run slowly, and I don’t run a lot, but I do it,” she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stepping up</h3>



<p>As people take more steps per day, the relative risk of dying over the next seven years drops sharply (below the horizontal line represents lower risk). This decrease slows around 7,000 steps for people age 60 or older (blue) and around 9,000 steps for those under 60 (red).</p>

<p>The message that people can reap health benefits from even a little bit of physical activity is seeping into the mainstream, says Lyndon Joseph, an exercise physiologist at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md. “You don&#8217;t have to be able to sprint like Usain Bolt,” he says. “You just need to be active.”</p>



<p>Scientists know physical activity works, Joseph says, though they don’t fully understand how. Why does walking, for example, which relies on leg muscles, also help the heart, lungs, kidneys and immune system? “The whole body responds to exercise,” Joseph says. Scientists are trying to figure out the molecules at play, and how those released from one tissue can improve the health of another. “That is the big question.”</p>



<p>How to get people to move — and do it consistently — is another big question. Changing people’s behavior is no easy feat, Stamatakis says. And massive structural barriers often stand in the way. Even if scientists get people on board with upping their step counts, if their neighborhoods don’t have sidewalks, hitting daily step goals becomes a lot more difficult.</p>



<p>More sidewalks, trails and bike paths would make it easier for people to rack up incidental physical activity. “The role of the environment is critical,” Stamatakis says. Lee agrees. Physical activity is not simply a personal choice, she says. Government policies can influence how much or little we’re able to do. Again, she emphasizes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/running-just-once-week-may-help-you-avoid-early-death">it doesn’t take much to get substantial health benefits</a> (<em>SN: 11/5/19</em>). And people can start at any level.</p>



<p>In fact, Lee says, “the biggest bang for your buck actually comes among people who go from doing nothing to doing just a little bit.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ant-face-patterns-practical-value">Ant face patterns like swirls and stubble might have practical value</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>National Harbor, Md. — </strong>Looking at face patterns in photos of more than 11,000 kinds of ants struck entomologist Clint Penick as a fine pandemic-lockdown project for his students.</p>



<p>From that socially distanced slog came the idea that the texture patterns might offer practical benefits, says Penick, of Auburn University in Alabama. For instance, some soil-dwelling ants with raised, swirling facial ridges — “almost psychedelic,” he says — could be getting extra protection from abrasion. The ridges lie so close together that sand grains can’t fit in between, he reported at <a href="https://www.entsoc.org/events/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Entomology 2023 meeting</a> in November.</p>



<p>Most ants have a smooth outer surface, or cuticle. But some grow elaborate patterns, such as tiny indentations “like dimples on a golf ball” or netted patterns like “cracks in mud,” says Penick, who started the project while at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. Ant taxonomists use more than 150 terms to describe the different cuticle patterns, with different names for some subtle distinctions. “They drive people like me crazy,” he says.</p>

<p>Mapping face textures onto an evolutionary tree of ant genera suggests that modern ant lineages must have <a href="https://myrmecologicalnews.org/cms/index.php?option=com_download&amp;view=download&amp;filename=volume33/mn33_123-138_printable.pdf&amp;format=raw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolved from smooth-faced ancestors</a>, reported Penick and his former grad student John Paul Hellenbrand, now at the City University of New York, in April in <em>Myrmecological News</em>. Since ants first emerged some 160 million to 140 million years ago near the beginning of the Cretaceous Period, various face textures have appeared, disappeared and sometimes reappeared. The multiple origins got the researchers wondering if the patterns could be of use to the insects instead of just random biological happenstance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Textures that look the same, however, might not yield the same benefit in different species, cautions evolutionary morphologist Brendon Boudinot of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, possibly abrasion-resistant fingerprint-like ridges show up in desert-dwelling, sand-digging <em>Pogonomyrmex </em>ants but also in their neighbors, trap-jaw <em>Odontomachus</em> ants. Yet trap-jaw ants “don&#8217;t push their faces through sand,” Boudinot says, so abrasion isn’t much of an issue. However, trap jaws can snap shut with such force that the ants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ants-snap-jaws-shoot-skyward-escape-death">launch into the air fast and far enough to escape danger</a> (<em>SN: 5/15/15</em>). Their curved face stripes, Boudinot speculates, might “diffuse stress or strain when those jaws are cocked.” But these ideas, he notes, need testing.</p>

<p>Penick agrees that confirmation of any possible benefits to cuticle patterns need experiments instead of just picture sorting. He can imagine other potential upsides: Some patterns might bolster structural support, influence biofilm growth or function in ant communication.</p>



<p>One confirmed benefit of the ant facial features, however, is for humans only. Penick recruited textile designer Meredith West Owens of Wilmington, N.C., to turn parts of ant face images into multicolored fabrics. Pulling small sections from face photos, she colored, stacked and blended each motif into a seamless flow. The effect took “a lot of math,” she says. Her decorative ant-inspired pillows plus a face T-shirt, now sold online, will raise a little money for Penick’s lab.</p>

<p>Elsevier’s Scopus database has paused indexing content from <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability"><em>Sustainability</em></a>, an MDPI journal, while it reevaluates whether to include the title, Retraction Watch has learned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other MDPI titles were reevaluated in 2023, and its mathematics journal <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms"><em>Axioms</em></a> is no longer included in Scopus’ nearly 30,000 titles. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fast-growing-open-access-journals-stripped-coveted-impact-factors">Clarivate also delisted two MDPI journals</a>, including the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>, from its Web of Science index earlier this year, meaning those journals will no longer receive impact factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Universities and funders use Scopus to create “<a href="https://units.kln.ac.lk/researchcouncil/media/attachments/2022/02/17/whitelist-of-journals.pdf">whitelists</a>” of journals in which authors are encouraged to publish, so removal from the index can influence submissions.</p>



<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.khrono.no/stryker-et-av-verdens-storste-fra-listen-over-godkjente-tidsskrifter/689264">Norway removed</a> <em>Sustainability </em>from its list of journals that researchers get credit for publishing in, and <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/sustainability-level-0-2023">Finland followed suit</a> at the beginning of 2023. In the announcement of its decision, the Finnish Publication Forum wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128493"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sustainability also publishes high-quality articles, but the wide scope, large publication volume and fast publication processes have undermined confidence that the journal&#8217;s procedures to ensure scientific quality work reliably down the line. The large variability in quality is partly the result of thousands of special issues that are common also in other MDPI journals.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/21100240100#tabs=2">number of articles</a> from <em>Sustainability</em> indexed in Scopus has increased nearly every year since 2009, its first year of coverage, when 78 articles were indexed. In 2022, the journal published over 17,000 articles. Scopus indexed about 13,500 in 2023, before the pause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staff for <em>Sustainability</em> learned on October 30 that Scopus’ <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/content/content-selection-and-advisory-board">Content Selection and Advisory Board</a> (CSAB) were reevaluating the journal, according to Elaine Li, the managing editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li confirmed the journal’s indexing is paused due to the reevaluation. If the process concludes positively, the content put on hold will be indexed within four weeks, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/scopus/content/content-policy-and-selection#2-title-re-evaluation">Scopus’ title reevaluation policy</a>, the index identifies “outlier and underperforming journals” for scrutiny based on citation metrics and benchmarks compared to other titles in the same field, when “legitimate” concerns are raised about the journal or publisher, or if Scopus’ algorithm flags outlier behavior. The CSAB can also decide the journal should be evaluated again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>No specific concerns were raised when the editorial office was asked to provide information required for the re-evaluation, therefore we are assuming that the reason for this re-evaluation is the continuous curation based on CSAB feedback.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Several other journals of MDPI&#8217;s portfolio have already undergone re-evaluation” in 2023, Li said, “and the majority was evaluated positively and is continuing to be indexed in Scopus.”</p>



<p>We asked Elsevier for more information, and a spokesperson responded:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We consider information about journal reviews as confidential. Once decisions are made relevant outcomes will be communicated through the regular channels.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 1/2/24, 2030 UTC: MDPI CEO Stefan Tochev told us after this story was published:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As at January 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/about/journals/scopus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MDPI has 269 of journals indexed in Scopus</a>. Notably, 54 of these journals were added in 2023, underscoring our dedication to maintaining rigorous academic standards across various disciplines. While we acknowledge Scopus&#8217; reevaluation process for specific journals, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the scope and depth of our presence in this indexing database.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>During the past year, I have been starting <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen/Junior-Group-Peter-Rupprecht.html">my own junior group</a> at the University of Zurich and spent some time finishing postdoc projects. After a laborious revision process with several challenging experiments, our study on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504030v2">hippocampal astrocytes and how they integrate calcium signals</a>, which was my main postdoc project with Frijtof Helmchen, is now accepted for publication (in principle), and I’m looking forward to venturing into new projects.</p>



<p>For this year-end write up, I want to discuss the book “The unfolding of language” by Guy Deutscher, which I read this Summer. The book is primarily about linguistics and the evolution of languages, but at the end of this blog post, I will connect some of its ideas with current lines of research in systems neuroscience.</p>



<p><strong>Languages as a pathway to understand thinking</strong> </p>



<p>After high school, my main interest was to understand how thoughts work. Among the various approaches to this broad question, I felt that I needed to choose between at least two paths. First, to study the physiology of neuronal systems, in order to understand how neurons connect, how they form memories, concepts, ideas, and finally thoughts. Second, to study the matrix that shapes our thoughts and that itself is formed by the dynamics and connections in our brain: language. I decided for the first trajectory, but I always remained curious about how to use language to understand our brain.</p>



<p>I like languages, especially from the theoretical perspective. I was a big fan of Latin in high school and particularly enjoyed to dive into the structure of its language, that is, its grammar. My mother tongue, German, also offered a lot of interesting and complex grammar to explore. And when I read through the books of J.R.R. Tolkien on Middle-earth, I was fascinated by all the world-building but in particular by the languages that he had invented. And I filled a few notebooks with some (less-refined) attempts to create my own languages. Apart from the beautiful words and the intriguing sounds, I was especially into the structure and grammar of these languages. &#8211; Later, I became relatively proficient in a few computer languages like C, Python, LaTeX, HTML or Matlab. I briefly tried to learn Chinese for a year, but although I was fascinated by the logical grammatical edifice, I did not have the same energy to internalize the look-up-tables of characters and sounds. Occupied with neuroscience and mostly reading and writing scientific English (a poor rip-off of proper English), I lost touch with the idea of using language to understand our thoughts and, therefore, the brain.</p>



<p><strong>“The unfolding of language”</strong></p>



<p>Then, Mid of last year, I came across the book <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theunfoldingoflanguage/home"><em>The unfolding of language</em></a> in a small but excellent <a href="https://www.orellfuessli.ch/buchhandlung/1052">bookstore</a> at Zurich main station. I was captivated immediately. And I enjoyed the book for several reasons.</p>

<p>First, the book is abundant with examples how language evolves, about the origin of words or grammatical structures. Many details that I never had bothered to consider, made suddenly sense, like some old German words, the French conjugation of verbs, or a certain declination of a Latin word. In addition, I learned a few surprising new principles about other languages, for example, the structure underlying the semitic languages, for which the author is an expert.</p>



<p>Second, the depiction of the evolution of language revealed a systematic aspect to these changes, even across languages even from different language families. I did have some basic knowledge about the language sound changes that had been observed around 1800 and described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_law">Grimm’s law</a>. However, Guy Deutscher’s book did not describe these systematic changes as artifacts of our history but as a natural process that occurred like this or similarly in many different languages, independently from each other. To some extent, reading about all these systematic and – to some extent – inevitable changes of language made me more relaxed about the distortions that language undergoes when used by younger generations or people who mix in loanwords from other languages without hesitation; language is a non-static, evolving object. But what is the evolution of language described by Guy Deutscher actually?</p>



<p><strong>The three principles of the evolution of language</strong></p>



<p>Deutscher mentions three main principles underlying the evolution of language. The strong impression that this book left on me was not only through these principles of language evolution, but even more so through the wealth of examples across languages, types of words and grammars that it provided.</p>



<p><strong>First principle: Economy</strong></p>



<p>“Economy&#8221;, according to Deutscher, mostly originates from the laziness of the language users, resulting in the omission or merging of words. One of the examples given in the book was the slow erosion of the name of the month “august” from the Latin word <em>augustus</em> over the Old French word <em>aost</em> to <em>août</em> (which is pronounced as <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ao%C3%BBt#Pronunciation"><em>/ut/</em></a>) in modern French. Such erosion of language appeared as the most striking feature of the evolution of language when it was discovered two centuries ago. It was an intriguing observation that the grammar of old languages like Latin or Sanskrit seemed to be so much more complex than the grammar of newer languages like German, Spanish or English. This observation led to the idea that language is not actually simply evolving but rather decaying.</p>



<p>Deutscher, however, describes how this apparent decay can also be the source and driving force for the creation of new structures. One particular compelling example is his description of how the French conjugation for the future tense has evolved. It is difficult to convey this complicated idea in brief terms, but it evolves around the idea that a late Latin expression like <em>amare habeo</em> (&#8220;I have to love&#8221;) evolved its meaning (to &#8220;I will love&#8221;), which was transferred to French, where the futur tense therefore contains the conjugation of the present tense of the word &#8220;to have&#8221;:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><em>j&#8217;aimer<strong>ai</strong></em></td><td>i will love</td><td><em>j&#8217;<strong>ai</strong></em></td><td>i have</td></tr><tr><td><em>tu aimer<strong>as</strong></em></td><td>you will love</td><td><em>tu <strong>as</strong></em></td><td>you have</td></tr><tr><td><em>il aimer<strong>a</strong></em></td><td>he will love</td><td><em>il <strong>a</strong></em></td><td>he has</td></tr><tr><td><em>nous aimer<strong>ons</strong></em></td><td>we will love</td><td><em>nous av<strong>ons</strong></em></td><td>we have</td></tr><tr><td><em>vous aimer<strong>ez</strong></em></td><td>you will love</td><td><em>vous av<strong>ez</strong></em></td><td>you have</td></tr><tr><td><em>ils aimer<strong>ont</strong></em></td><td>they will love</td><td><em>ils <strong>ont</strong></em></td><td>they have</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I knew both Latin and French quite well, but this connection struck me as both surprising and compelling. Deutscher also comes up with other examples of how grammar was generated by erosion, but you will have to read the book to make up your own mind.<br /></p>



<p><strong>Second principle: Expressiveness</strong></p>



<p>Expressiveness comes from the desire of language users to highlight and stress what they want to say, in order to overcome the natural inflation of meaning through usage. A typical example are the simple words &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221;, which are simple and short and therefore often enhanced for emphasis (&#8220;yes, of course!&#8221; or &#8220;not at all!&#8221;).</p>



<p>A funny example given by Deutscher is the French word <em>aujourd’hui</em>, which means “today” and is one of the first words that an early beginner learns about French. Deutscher points out that this word was derived from the Latin expression <em>hoc die</em> (“on this day”), which eroded to the Old French word <em>hui</em> (&#8220;today&#8221;). To more strongly emphasize the word, people started to say <em>au jour d’hui</em>, which basically means “on the day of this day”. Later, <em>au jour d’hui</em> was eroded to <em>aujourd’hui</em>. Nowadays, French speakers start using <em>au jour d’aujourd’hui</em> to put more emphasis on the expression. Therefore, the expression means &#8220;today&#8221; but literally can be decoded as “on the day of the day of this day”. This example illustrates the close interaction of the expressiveness principle and the erosion principle. And it shows that we are carrying these multiple layers of eroded expressiveness with our us, often without noticing ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>Third principle: Analogy</strong></p>



<p>“Analogy” occurs when humans observe irregularities of language and try to impose rules in order to get rid of exceptions that do not really fit in. For example, children might say “the ship sinked” instead of “the ship sank”. Through erosion, language can take a shape that does not make any sense (because its history of evolution, which would shine a light on the shape, is not obvious), and we try to counteract and impose some structure.</p>



<p><strong>Metaphors are the connection between the physical world and abstraction</strong></p>



<p>But there is one more ingredient that, according to Deutscher, drives the evolution of language. It is this aspect which I found most interesting and most closely connected to neuroscience: metaphors. This idea might sound surprising at first, but once it unfolds by means of examples, it becomes more and more convincing. Deutscher depicts metaphors as a way – actually, <em>the </em>way – how the meaning of words can become more abstract over time.</p>



<p>He gives examples of daily used language and then dissects the used words as having roots in the concrete world. These roots had been lost by usage but can still be seen through the layers of erosion and inflation of meaning. For instance, “abstraction” as a word comes from the Latin words <em>ab</em> and <em>strahere</em>, which basically means “to pull something off of sth.”, that is, to remove a word from its concrete meaning. “Pulling sth off”, on the other hand, is something very concrete, rooted in the physical word.</p>



<p>Such abstraction of meanings is most obvious for loanwords from other languages (here, from Latin). But Deutscher brings up convincing examples of how this process occurs as well for words that evolved within a given language. To give a very simple example that also highlights what Deutscher means when he speaks of metaphors: in the expressions “harsh measures”, the “harsh” has roots in the physical world, describing for example the roughness of a surface (&#8220;rough&#8221; or, originally, &#8220;hairy&#8221;). Later, however, &#8220;harsh&#8221; has been applied to abstract concepts such as “measures”– originally as a metaphor that we, however, do no longer perceive as such. Deutscher recounts many more examples, which, in their simplicity, are sometimes quite eye-opening. He makes the fascinating point that all abstracts words are rooted in the physical world and are therefore mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_metaphor">dead metaphors</a>. And how could one not agree with this hypothesis? Because, what else can be the origin of a word if not physical reality?</p>



<p><strong>How metaphors create the grammar of languages</strong></p>



<p>Deutscher, however, even goes beyond this idea and posits that abstraction and metaphors may have created also more complex aspects of language. For example, in most languages, there are three perspectives: me, you and they. He makes the point that these perspectives might have derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative">demonstratives</a>. &#8220;Here&#8221; transforms to &#8220;me&#8221;, &#8220;there&#8221; to &#8220;you&#8221;, and a third word for something more distant &#8220;over there&#8221; to &#8220;they&#8221;. All of these words are “pointing” words, probably deriving from and originally accompanying pointing gestures. In English, the third kind of word does not really exist as clearly, but for example Japanese features the threefold distinction between <em>koko </em>(&#8220;here&#8221;), <em>soko </em>(&#8220;there&#8221;) and <em>asoko </em>(&#8220;over there&#8221;). The third category is represented in Latin by the word <em>ille</em>, which refers to somebody who is more distant. As a nice connection, the Latin word <em>ille</em> was the origin for the French word <em>il/ils</em>, which means “he/they”. This shows how the metaphorical use of words related to the physical world (point words) can generate abstract concepts like grammar, here: the third person. Deutscher alos brings up languages where the connection between the three demonstratives for persons of variable distances and the pronouns for me/you/they is more directly visible, for example in Vietnamese.</p>



<p>Therefore, Deutscher plausibly demonstrates how not only abstract words, but also more complex structures that underlie the most basic grammar, are evolved from metaphorical usage of concrete words that are related to the physical world, either because they describe physical things (the surface roughness) or because they are originally only enhancements of gestures (pointing words). These ideas in the book are amongst the most interesting ones that I have encountered for quite some time.</p>



<p><strong>Embedding of “The unfolding of language” in current research</strong></p>



<p>Overall, I like the hypotheses presented by Deutscher. The only issue I have is that there are many missing bits and pieces that prevent me from properly see through all potential weaknesses. I simply don’t know whether these questions are unanswered in general or whether Deutscher did not have enough space to treat them in this (popular science) book. Put differently, the book was very engaging and a fascinating read but did not provide useful links to the research literature. How are all these ideas embedded in current linguistics research, or is all of this Deutscher’s own concepts? I observed that there are some links in this work to ideas like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor">conceptual metaphor</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">linguistic relativity</a>, but I was unable to really figure out where to get started if I wanted to dig deeper into the principal role of metaphorical use for the development of grammar and abstraction. If a linguistics expert somehow happens to read this blog post, I’d be really happy to get a recommendation on a standard textbook (if there is any) on these topics and how Guy Deutscher&#8217;s work fits in.</p>



<p><strong>Metaphors, abstraction and system neuroscience</strong></p>



<p>However, I’d like to briefly discuss an aspect of the metaphor principle that I found particularly interesting, also because of a potential, albeit loose, link to current research in neuroscience. Many neuroscientists are probably aware of the large branch of neuroscience dedicated to understanding the generation and representation of abstract knowledge. This can take very different forms, but one of the most prominent takes is the idea that the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, originally shown to represent space (via the famous <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/okeefe-lecture.pdf">place cells</a> and <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/edvard-moser-lecture.pdf">grid cells</a>, respectively), also represents more abstract knowledge.</p>



<p>The entorhinal cortex represents physical space using the above-mentioned grid cells that span space with hexagonal lattices of varying spatial scales. Building upon the hexagonal lattice idea, researchers attempted to apply the concept experimentally to more <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaf0941">abstract 2D spaces</a>. For example, such an abstract conceptual space would not be spanned by the physical axes “x” and “y” but for example by the conceptual axes “neck length” and “leg length” of a bird. I have to admit that I was not fully convinced by this approach, but it is interesting nevertheless.</p>



<p>Apart from these experimental approaches, researchers have developed theories about the representation of abstract knowledge based on hexagonal lattices (for an example theory, see <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00121/full">Hawkins et al., 2019</a>). Or check out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00499-9">this review</a> of experimental literature that concludes that grid cells reflect the topological relationship of objects, with this relationship being defined either via space or via more abstract connections. These approaches have in common that abstract concepts are built upon the neuronal scaffold; the neuronal scaffold, in turn, is provided by the representation of physical space.</p>



<p>In Deutscher&#8217;s book, I found a description that paralleled the above ideas from systems neuroscience, enough to make it intriguing. First, Deutscher posits that all words that now describe abstract relationships are rooted in meanings that represent physical space. More precisely, words that were originally used to describe physical relationships (e.g., “outside”), were later taken to describe an abstract relationship (&#8220;outside of sth&#8221;, with the same meaning as &#8220;apart from sth&#8221;). We even don&#8217;t notice the metaphorical usage here because it is so common, even across languages (<em>hormis </em>in French, <em>utenom </em>in Norwegian, <em>ausserdem </em>in German). Deutscher highlights one specific field where the transition of spatial to more abtract descriptors is very apparant. &#8220;Before&#8221;, &#8220;after&#8221;, &#8220;around&#8221;, &#8220;at&#8221; or &#8220;on&#8221; are all prepositions that describe physical relationships but that were lateron assigned to temporal relationships as well. It seems quite obvious and not worth any further thought, but is it really?</p>



<p>Deutscher not only suggests that spatial relationships are more basic than temporal relationships, but he strengthens this point by pointing out that words that describe physical relationships derived from something even simpler: the own body. For example, &#8220;in front of&#8221; derives from the French word <em>front </em>(&#8220;forehead&#8221;). Deutscher brings up many more examples from diverse languages that reveal how the language that describes abstract relationships can be traced back to body parts. Therefore, he hypothesizes that body parts (&#8220;forehead&#8221;, &#8220;back&#8221;, &#8220;feet&#8221;, etc.) were originally used to establish a system of spatial relationships, which was then applied to temporal and other more abstract relationships. It would be interesting to investigate these lines of thought for systems neuroscience (for example, egocentric vs. allocentric coding of position, or how temporal sequences are required to define abstract knowledge representations).</p>



<p>One of the open questions here is about a potential interaction between abstractions, language and neuronal representations. Was this connection already implemented on the neuronal level before the inception of language, such that language only had to use this analogy generator? Researchers who work on abstract knowledge representation in animals like mice would probably say so. Or was it only through language that abstraction was enabled? I find both possibilities equally likely. Often, we cannot use a concept or idea efficiently when we don’t put it into an expression &#8211; concepts remain vague and often difficult to judge if we don’t pour them into clear thoughts, ideally written down in a consistent and concise set of sentences.</p>



<p>In the end, I find the ideas about the evolution of language extremely interesting, especially because they relate to the generation of abstract relationships (temporal relationships, language grammar, or fully abstract concepts). From my point of view, two aspects could be worth some further research. First, to dig into the status of the linguistic research on these topics. And second, to understand whether there are any meaningful parallels between abstraction in neuronal representations and abstraction derived within an evolving and eroding language. In any way, I can recommend this book fully to anybody who is not afraid of foreign languages and a bit of grammar.</p>

<p>P.S. I’ve read the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theunfoldingoflanguage/home/Du-Jane">German version</a> of Deutscher’s book. It is not simply a translation of the English version but provides many additional examples from the German language that enhance or replace the examples taken from English.

Let’s skip straight to the neuroscience this year, shall we? Even this one small area of human endeavour has not escaped the forces unleashed by tech bros who think ethics are something that happen to other people. A once thriving neuroscience Twitter community dissolved thanks to He Who Shall Not Be Named, the battle-hardened remaining to rail against the dying of the light, others scattered to other platforms, sadly disconnected from one another. ChatGPT and its ilk, tools of such potential, also brought with them a wave of garbage science, including tranches of grammatically-correct, woefully-poor student essays, full of fun facts about studies that did not happen: did you know, for example, about Geoff Schoenbaum’s primate studies on decision making?</p><p>And yet, science prevails. This machine for creating knowledge moves at such pace and fury that even Musk is but a pebble causing a scant ripple in its flow. As you’ll see, we’ve learnt a lot about the brain this year, about what the brain doesn’t have, what it does have, and about expert game players. But what we learnt most about was dopamine.</p><h4><strong>Error Error Error</strong></h4><p>You wouldn’t have thought we’d have much new to learn about dopamine. Or, more accurately, about how dopamine conveys information about reward. It’s been 25 years since Schultz, Dayan &amp; Montague’s <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.275.5306.1593">classic paper in <em>Science</em></a> laid out how the firing of dopamine neurons in a monkey’s midbrain looked remarkably like they were signalling the error in predicting a reward: firing more to unexpected rewards, not changing their firing to expected rewards, and firing less when an expected reward didn’t turn up. Indeed, just the error expected in reinforcement-learning models that seek to learn the future value of things in the world.</p><p>After 25 years, most research fields in science are either abandoned to the historians as embarrassing dead-ends, stagnate from lack of new ideas, or become mainstream, their facts regurgitated in dull textbooks, reaching that Kuhnian “business as usual” stage. But not dopamine. This year started with a flurry of head-scratching, high-profile papers on what those pesky handful of midbrain dopamine neurons were conveying to the rest of the brain.</p><p>Jeong and colleagues <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq6740">kicked us off by claiming</a> dopamine isn’t a signal for prediction error at all, but a signal for unexpected sequences of events in the world. Roughly speaking. Proposing a new model for how the brain learns causality between events in the world, they gave the firing of dopamine neurons the job of conveying a term in that model that, well, was so hard to explain they didn’t bother, but is roughly how unexpected it was that one event followed another given how well that event is usually predicted. Frankly, they didn’t manage to explain why dopamine should have that job and not one of the other, at least two, error terms the model needed. Nonetheless, by assuming dopamine was this “adjusted net contingency for causal relations”, the new model did an impressive job of replicating the firing of dopamine neurons in a range of classical conditioning tasks, tasks where the animal just sits there and things happen around it: bells predict food; beeps predict water. The idea that dopamine is crucial to learning causality <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2022">is not new</a>, but Jeong and co make a good point that conceptually it’s easier to learn backwards, from stuff you’ve already experienced, than forwards, by predicting the future values of stuff you’re going to experience.</p><p>Mere weeks later, Markowitz and (many) colleagues <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05611-2">took a look </a>at the release of dopamine in mice running free, doing whatever they wanted in an open field (well, a 40cm diameter bucket). Dividing the mouse’s behaviour up into syllables, discrete bits of action like rearing or turning or scratching, they found the release of dopamine dips just before the end of one syllable and peaks just after the start of the next one. The data suggested that the bigger the peak of dopamine, the more likely the syllable was to occur again. From this Markowitz and co speculated that dopamine signals were thus being used internally to promote behaviours, just as they would be if those dopamine signals were evoked externally by reward. Between them, these first two papers were arguing there was much to dopamine beyond the error in predicting a reward.</p><p>A week later, Coddington, Lindo, and Dudman <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05614-z">offered us a rather different take</a> by pointing out that reinforcement learning had still much to offer. What, they asked, if we were looking at the wrong kind of reinforcement learning? You see, reinforcement learning models come in two flavours. In one, they learn about the value of things in the world, then decide what to do based on those learnt values. That’s where the classic dopamine-as-prediction-error comes in, as an error in those predicted values. In the other, they just learn directly what to do in each situation; they learn a “policy”.</p><p>Coddington and co. offered some (pretty impressive) evidence that the firing of dopamine neurons acts like the learning rate of something that’s directly learning a policy. That is, high firing rates would be big updates to the policy, low firing rates would be small updates. They offer us a double departure from the canonical theory: not only is dopamine not a prediction error for value, it’s not a prediction error at all.</p><p>AND THEN — yes, there’s more — in late summer were two bombshells. Jesse Goldberg’s team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06580-w">casually dropped into conversation</a> that actually the dopamine neurons’ firing is not just fixed to a prediction error for reward. Rather, it is assigned to sending an error about whatever is most important right now. They showed this in male birds singing. Singing on its own, a bird’s dopamine neurons fired about the unexpected errors he made in his song (this much <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/your-brain-is-smarter-than-you-how-it-tells-you-when-you-made-a-mistake-30f523571042">we already knew</a>). But when singing to a female, the dopamine neurons fired after unexpected response calls from the female, when the male didn’t get the reaction it was predicting, whether that was good (she replied!) or not so good (she’s ignoring me). Ah, dopamine, now we can add awkward adolescent male courting to your list of responsibilities.</p><p>The second late summer bombshell was potentially the biggest. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05995-9">Tritsch and friends reported</a> that the release of dopamine into the striatum is oscillating at between 0.5 and 4Hz, going up and down at least every two seconds and at most four times a second. Oscillating all the time, whether resting, moving, or getting reward. And on such a scale that the peaks of release were as big as those evoked by unexpected reward. This could be a problem.</p><p>For you see all current theories of what dopamine tells the brain still rest on the idea that there is a baseline from which the changes in dopamine convey information. That baseline defines what is “expected”. This is true of reward prediction error theories; it’s also true of the causality theory (it’s not true if we want to believe dopamine is a learning rate, but then it’s unclear why would we want that to be oscillating a few times a second). Tritsch and friends say there is no baseline.</p><p>What now? If neuroscience were like physics then tens of papers would have been posted to arXiv before Tritsch’s paper had even hit the stands as swarms of otherwise underemployed theorists descended on the latest anomaly to propose new, exotic theories that explained it away. And then discovering that t<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_OPERA_faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly">he data were actually due to a loose cable</a>, and all was for nought. But neuroscience is not like physics. Sometimes that’s a good thing.</p><h4><strong>Unexpected papers in the bagging area</strong></h4><p>It’s often claimed that the glam journals, <em>Nature, Science, Cell </em>and their like, don’t publish replications and don’t publish null results. That’s not true. It’s just that, when they do, they have to be gargantuan bodies of work. This year, Bassetto et al published, in <em>Nature</em>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06397-7">a staggering paper</a> showing that there was no evidence for a magnetic sense in fly brains. They replicated two previous experiments, one showing that flies avoid the arm of a T-shaped maze that has a magnetic field and another showing that flies knocked to the bottom of a tube take longer to climb up if exposed to a magnetic field. Both published in high-profile journals, and both taken as evidence that fly brains contain some kind of receptor system for magnetic fields.</p><p>Bassetto and co showed convincingly that neither thing happened: flies did not care about magnetic fields, neither avoiding the arm of the maze nor taking longer to climb up the tube. And when I say convincing, I mean really convincing. A total of 97658 flies tested on the maze and 10960 flies in the tube. Repeated replications of both experiments in ever more stringent conditions, from using the exact same fly lines, up to building custom magnetically-shielded chambers to rule out any effects from the (many) weak magnetic fields in any lab — including the Earth’s own.</p><p>Six years of work, no result. Except, in truth, two major results. The first was the total absence of statistics in the paper. With so many subjects, any hypothesis test would almost certainly have found a “significant” difference between the groups, when that was not the interesting question — the question was “is there an effect”? Instead, the authors simply showed us the result, and the result was obvious. Rutherford’s dictum in action: “If you need to do statistics, you’ve done the wrong experiment.”</p><p>And the second result? That this is a model for how to do science. A veritable “house of brick” rather than the exploratory, small-N “mansions of straw” we often read in glam mags (*cough* <em>Cell</em> *cough*). And in case you don’t know what I’m talking about, go <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/545387a">read that op-ed</a> now.</p><p>It’s also often claimed that glam journals don’t publish behavioural studies. Yet witness this year <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06124-2">a rather lovely paper</a> from Wei Ji Ma’s lab, led by Bas van Opheusden. They showed us that expertise in a game increases the depth to which people can plan their moves. People played a two-player four-in-a-row game, taking it in turns to place their counter in any free space on a 9x4 grid. They played each other, they played computers, they played in huge numbers on a mobile app. van Opheusden and co showed players’ performance was well described by a model that computed a rough idea of the value of each state of the board, and searched for the next best move from the current state by looking at the values of the possible next moves. With that model they found two main things. The better players got, the further the model said they searched from the starting position. But they also showed that players’ attention was well replicated by the model, predicting where they were looking on the board while thinking.</p><p>This, for me, was the new connectionism writ large: purely behavioural data, and plenty of it, a systematic exploration of necessary model features, and often impressive model fits to each player used to infer mechanisms. Striking was the lack of vestigial neuroimaging, that urge to tack on a figure showing activation in some brain region to somehow validate the work. Just behaviour and computational modelling done to a high standard and published in a glam journal. Lovely.</p><p>And to round off the year, there dropped <a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/fgihbeccbd">another gigantic collection of papers</a> about cell types in the brain of a mouse from the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network. Where just two years ago we were bathing in ten or so papers on the mouse’s primary motor cortex, now we’ve at least ten papers on a cell atlas of the whole mouse brain. We learnt that there are lots of different cell types, that different types are in different regions of the brain, and that the majority use either glutamate or GABA. You may be thinking that we knew this already but I couldn’t possibly comment. But we can all agree it’s a huge effort and a valuable resource – the value in these cataloguing projects lies in the discoveries built upon them, from the new ways of targeting specific neurons to trace them and tag them and make them fire (or not). Who knows what it could potentially unlock?</p><p>The mouse brain is now “finished” for the types of cells within it. Presumably in just the same way as the <em>C Elegans</em> connectome was “complete” in 1986, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1352-7">the updates</a> to it ever since are mere ephemera. Or the human genome sequence was “complete” in 2001, and the fact that the first end-to-end sequence of all bases was <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6987">published only last year</a> is mere trifling detail.</p><p>Next up: all the cells in the human brain. And while turning to this challenge, one might bear in mind the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03954-y">surprisingly scathing editorial</a> in <em>Nature</em> accompanying the BICCN papers, about how daft it is for these huge brain projects to be working in silos, without coordination, duplicating efforts, and not working out how to share data.</p><p><strong>Let’s all go home we’re wasting our time</strong><br> <br>I opened this essay revelling in the unstoppable force of science; I’ve just reviewed for you some of the year’s most headline-grabbing advances in neuroscience. But this was also the year <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x">a major paper claimed</a> science is becoming less disruptive.</p><p>Its authors proposed a fun measure of how disruptive a bit of science has been: take the paper announcing it and count how often future papers cite that one without citing anything older. A neat idea, capturing our intuitive idea that disruptive work changes the course of a scientific field, its older work abandoned rapidly in the stampede to catch up. Nice measure, shame about the conclusion.</p><p>They found their measure decreased over time, up to the present day, leading them to claim that newer science is less disruptive, because we continue to cite older work. But actually it’s all relative: their measure corrected for the exponential increase in published papers over time, so their claim is that science is proportionally less disruptive. Their data showed the absolute number of disruptive papers (and patents) was pretty stable over time. Science is as disruptive as it ever was: it’s just that the disruptive stuff is increasingly outnumbered by the incremental.</p><p>That’s hardly a surprise. There’s been an exponential increase in the number of scientists since the 1950s. Their job is to produce research. Papers are how they are weighed and measured. So they write a lot of papers, because they have to. So all we’ve learnt is that if you incentivise a global talent pool of scientists to churn out papers as fast as they can, while also teaching, marking, tutoring, sitting on committees, reviewing, interviewing, and endless others “ings”, then those papers are not, unsurprisingly, deeply thought, long-nurtured disruptive ideas.</p><h4><strong>I see all good people</strong></h4><p>Let’s end on some good news. Humanity isn’t actually the ugly cesspit we see on social media: it only thinks it is.</p><p>Titling their paper “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06137-x">The illusion of moral decline</a>,” Mastroianni and Gilbert summoned strong evidence that people across the world think morality has declined over time: multiple questionnaires across 60 nations, stretching back over 70 years. I’m sure you can think of some social media post, newspaper columnist, or talking head claiming as much just this week: moral standards are falling; things aren’t what they used to be. But Mastroianni and Gilbert strongly suggest this is an illusion.</p><p>You see, in those same questionnaires, the actual ratings of the morality of people’s peers does not change over time. People rate their everyday interactions with peers just as they always have, with the same level of moral behaviour. For 70 years, there has been no change in how people rate the moral behaviour of themselves or of others around them.</p><p>Why then do we think morality is declining? Of the many reasons, the most obvious is simple: we remember when we see bad behaviour more than when we see good behaviour. And when there are a few high-profile people in positions of power indulging in endless poor moral choices it leaves a lasting impression. A good lesson to take forward to 2024, as we go into the biggest year of democratic elections in history: some of the people who lead us may be morally bankrupt, but pretty much everyone else is just as good or bad as they’ve always been. So go vote for them.</p><p><em>X/Twitter: </em><a href="https://twitter.com/markdhumphries"><em>@markdhumphries</em></a><em><br>Mastodon: </em><a href="https://neuromatch.social/@markdhumphries"><em>@markdhumphries@neuromatch.social</em></a></p><p>My book<em> The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds</em> is published by Princeton University Press, and available now from your favourite bookseller in <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691241487/the-spike">paperback</a>, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691195889/the-spike">hardback</a>, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9780691213514/the-spike">e-book</a>, and <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/audio/9780691224091/the-spike">audiobook</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ece56b1dcc89" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/2023-a-review-of-the-year-in-neuroscience-ece56b1dcc89">2023: A Review of the Year in Neuroscience</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What should happen to the millions of dollars publishers rake in from authors whose work is later retracted?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guillaume Cabanac, one of the developers of the <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a>, has repeatedly suggested publishers donate such revenue to charity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now one is doing just that.</p>



<span id="more-128488"></span>



<p>Recently, IOP Publishing took Cabanac up on his suggestion, and has begun <a href="https://www.research4life.org/news/iop-donates-to-r4l/">sending the article processing fees (APCs) from articles it retracts to Research4Life</a>, an organization that “provides institutions in low-and middle-income countries with online access to academic and professional peer-reviewed content,” according to its <a href="https://www.research4life.org/about/">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In posts on <a href="https://x.com/gcabanac/status/1542609298685034497?s=20">twitter.com</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22journal-level+report%22+charities">PubPeer</a>, and in a recent interview in <a href="https://t.co/pyOEbwRGOU"><em>The Times</em></a>, Cabanac has called for publishers who charge APCs to authors of open-access papers to donate those fees when they issue retractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cabanac told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>APCs of retracted papers should not be kept by publishers (this would hinder incentives to correct the record).</p>



<p>They should not be returned to authors (especially when they are papermill customers).</p>



<p>Transferring APCs to a charity (or the CSI [Center for Scientific Integrity, Retraction Watch’s parent nonprofit]) will support a good cause (or integrity endeavours).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kim Eggleton, head of peer review and research integrity at IOP Publishing, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We exist to disseminate trusted research and safeguard the scientific record, so we can’t justify financially benefiting from retracted papers. This donation, along with our promise to channel further APC revenues from retracted papers to Research4Life, feels like the right thing to do. It also means that something positive can come out of the current research integrity issues we are facing as an industry. We chose Research4Life because their work to boost access to knowledge and raise standards of research skills globally is so important and aligned with our values as a community focussed, society publisher.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>IOP Publishing donated 100% of the money it received from retracted papers this year, and plans to do the same each year, a spokesperson said. The publisher declined to give a specific amount for the donation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As “a way to support research integrity even further,” Cabanac said, “sleuths should unite in a kind of nonprofit association funded by the APCs of retracted papers!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This money would encourage sleuthing and support the people who dedicate time and efforts to correct the literature &#8212; pro bono!</p>



<p>&#8230; and sometime taking risks of harassment, intimidation&#8230;</p>



<p>A kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)">white hat hacking</a>&#8230; but for sleuthing.</p>



<p>This association would welcome any donation from the publishing industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cabanac does free consulting for the publishing industry, he said, and has heard from many publishers and integrity officers who use the tools he’s developed as a sleuth. He said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;m realising it&#8217;s unfair that these companies (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">oligopolies</a>) don&#8217;t support some dedicated, brilliant fellow sleuths who are struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Did 2023 feel like a year in which you couldn’t keep up, whether that was your to-do list, the news, or email?</p>



<p>We know the feeling.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <em>Nature</em> reported that journals retracted more than <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8">10,000 papers this year</a> – so many, in fact, that we have not been able to enter them all into The Retraction Watch Database yet, because each one has to be reviewed by hand. It’s not unusual for us to have to keep working into the following year to catch up, but the volume this year will mean that will all take longer.</p>



<p>The value of that database – 45,000 retractions strong and counting – was the basis for our biggest development this year: Its acquisition by Crossref, in a deal that makes the data fully available for free, and provides us sustainable funding for the database side of our operations. We’re still pinching ourselves about that agreement, and we can’t wait to see just how many scholars, software developers, and others dream up new uses for the data.</p>



<span id="more-128476"></span>



<p>The volume of retractions, particularly those that were high-profile, was responsible for another phenomenon you may have noticed in 2023: The mainstream media is all over them. Just do a Google News search and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=retracts+paper&amp;sca_esv=594057978&amp;biw=1194&amp;bih=598&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sxsrf=AM9HkKmUv3Z4NH1qdFsg58bCuAalNHzhvQ%3A1703706173047&amp;ei=PX6MZeXPArm0ptQP1eKxkA0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil4vuJsLCDAxU5mokEHVVxDNIQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=retracts+paper&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LW5ld3MiDnJldHJhY3RzIHBhcGVyMgoQABgWGB4YDxgKMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeSI0CUABYAHAAeACQAQCYAUKgAUKqAQExuAEDyAEAiAYB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-news">see for yourself</a>. Although that fact means far more competition for scoops, we couldn’t be happier to see interest – rare in 2010 when we launched – flourish. We have, in some ways, transitioned to being a resource for other reporters, as we were in this <a href="https://journalistsresource.org/media/how-to-cover-academic-research-fraud-errors-webinar/">Harvard Kennedy School Journalists’ Resource webinar</a>. We’re delighted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We had a few other key accomplishments this year. A sampling:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fred Joelving joined us as editor, thanks to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/retraction-watch-grows-again-thanks-to-a-250000-grant-from-the-woodnext-foundation/">generous grant from the WoodNext Foundation</a>. Take a look at the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/frederik-joelving/">work he’s produced so far</a>, which is stellar.</li>



<li>We launched <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">The Retraction Watch Mass Resignations List</a>, which is up to two dozen cases of editorial boards that quit following disagreements with publishers.</li>



<li>We published invited opinion pieces in <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1887"><em>The BMJ</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/scientific-misconduct-retraction-watch"><em>The Guardian</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-corrects-itself-right-a-scandal-at-stanford-says-it-doesnt/"><em>Scientific American</em></a>. We also wrote for <em><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/when-scholars-sue-their-accusers">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em>.</li>



<li>We’ve published investigations and other stories with <a href="https://undark.org/2023/05/31/in-the-death-of-an-iranian-scientist-hints-of-unchecked-strife/">Undark</a>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">Science</a>, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/09/retracted-suicide-risk-study-how-published/">STAT</a>, and the Flatwater Free Press (with <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/a-cornhusker-concussion-study-appeared-to-accurately-id-head-injuries-then-it-hit-a-brick-wall/">pickup by Nebraska Public Media</a>).</li>



<li>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2023.104815">study published in <em>Research Policy</em></a> “found that reporting retractions on RW significantly reduced post-retraction citations of non-swiftly retracted articles in biomedical sciences.” In other words, when Retraction Watch covers a retraction, the retracted paper is less likely to be cited.</li>

<p>Scopus has struck all links to the homepages of journals it indexes, Elsevier announced earlier this month. The move follows revelations that content from dozens of hijacked journals had been included in the database.</p>



<p>In a December 18 <a href="https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-will-remove-the-source-homepage-links-from-all-source-details-pages">blog post</a>, Scopus – which  many universities and government agencies around the world use to create journal “<a href="https://units.kln.ac.lk/researchcouncil/media/attachments/2022/02/17/whitelist-of-journals.pdf">whitelists</a>” where authors are encouraged or even paid to publish – explains its rationale:</p>



<span id="more-128481"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For example, scenarios may arise where the registration of a journal website lapses, or a genuine journal website is transferred to a new URL and the ‘old’ URL is taken over by another party. In a more severe situation, if a journal is hijacked, malicious actors may create a fraudulent duplicate of the journal’s website or mimic the appearance of the original journal to deceive researchers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Retraction Watch readers may be familiar with the phenomenon of hijacked journals, which we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">cataloged since 2022</a>. In November, I published a paper showing that data from <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24855">67 legitimate but hijacked journals</a> had been compromised in Scopus in the decade leading up to September 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among these, 33 indexed unauthorized content, meaning papers published on a fake website were covered by Scopus. Twenty-three hijacked journals compromised the homepage link of a legitimate journal, redirecting it to a hijacked, rather than a genuine, journal. In 11 cases, hijacked journals succeeded in compromising both the content and the homepage link.</p>



<p>Elsevier told <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scholarly-database-listed-hundreds-papers-hijacked-journals"><em>Science</em> in a story reporting on that paper on December 5</a> it had begun an investigation of the issue. The publisher announced on December 18 it planned to remove journal URLs.<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scholarly-database-listed-hundreds-papers-hijacked-journals">&nbsp;</a></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The indexing of hijacked journal papers continues, however. A day after the December 18 blog post, Scopus alerted some users,&nbsp; including me,&nbsp; it had indexed new documents from the <em>Hunan Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Hunan University Natural Sciences</em>. The email referred to a paper titled &#8216;Solution to the Klein-Gordon Equation Using FEM,&#8217; published in issue 50 (7) of <em>Hunan Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Hunan University Natural Sciences</em> on pages 233-240.</p>



<p>The problem is that Scopus has already indexed a paper from the same journal, issue, and overlapping pages, as demonstrated from this screenshot taken December 19:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3wOhILMcJdnL1xZf_10_as2KyECKnyGOlB_pC7gcRxj4es_FxzH_dkObrNEd24urd3f_r4-skE3WDGn4yfb-XRD8Qpe3R4XEVCnuMnvizuZZWjul7jOG8tUz3FoZxa25qvvE6SB8KRguuW0m-S8EYzQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This paper &#8216;Solution to the Klein-Gordon Equation Using FEM’, along with many others, was published on the website jonuns.com, which hosts a cloned version of <em>Hunan Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Hunan University Natural Sciences</em>. Scopus currently indexes papers from both legitimate and cloned journals that result in different paper titles published on overlapping pages of the same issues of the journal.</p>



<p>This journal is one of the 67 identified in my November paper, which documented entries until September of this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Since September 2023, at least three hijacked journals had their links on the homepages of legitimate journals, redirecting to fraudulent sites (the links in these screenshots have since been deleted):</p>



<p>*<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="792" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/vrucWWs0aoKWG1FKbin37_GXAYAJYMBEyfkn-KwgVh8Q88R8vFSTNKVUCoTf8-zMsxMDD-hBegDMP5lr3DZuu82PLpgjN7u6uJ_A1Q2SCQc_MeoS1SDB2m6KR7haCHUfBkB-a9jgzsngq7-rS-I70W4"></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">How these hijacked journals managed to change the link rather quickly is unclear, especially when honest journals, such as the <em>Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/11/03/my-journal-was-hijacked-an-editors-experience/">struggled for many months to reclaim their links back</a> to the profile of the journal.</p>



<p>Elsevier notes in its blog post that Scopus now allows the homepage to be accessed through a DOI, for which the publisher is responsible:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since the “View at Publisher” links from Scopus to the full text of the article will still be available, it may be possible for a user to reach the journal homepage via the full text link. Unlike the Source Homepage link, the “View at Publisher” link to the full text is created through the DOI of the article and the destination of that link is managed by the publisher itself. The quality of these links is therefore not a concern.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the<em> </em>‘view at publisher’ link for the<em> Hunan Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Hunan University Natural Sciences </em>paper indexed in Scopus earlier this month led directly to a hijacked journal. That suggests that deleting homepage URLs will not solve the problem of hijacked journals infiltrating Scopus, as non-authentic content has been present in the database since 2013.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(The paper has since been deleted from Scopus, but some other unauthorized content in this journal remains.)</p>



<p>Of note, many journals indexed by Scopus lack the &#8216;view at publisher&#8217; option, either because they do not have DOIs or because they are published only in print. Furthermore, the ‘view at publisher’ option is only available in the subscription version of Scopus.</p>

<p>Each year <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/top-10-retractions-of-2013-38213">since 2013</a>, we put together a roundup of the 10&nbsp; most-read stories we published on the blog over the past 12 months.</p>



<p>This list doesn’t have some of what you might think are the biggest stories of the year—Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne’s resignation and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/31/stanford-president-retracts-two-science-papers-following-investigation/">retractions</a>, allegations of fraud against Harvard Business School professor <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/when-scholars-sue-their-accusers">Francesca Gino</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03398-4">unraveling of the claimed discovery</a> of a room-temperature superconductor. Or more recently, allegations of plagiarism, with associated corrections, by Harvard president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/us/harvard-claudine-gay-plagiarism.html">Claudine Gay</a>.</p>



<p>When other outlets are paying a lot of attention to a retraction-related story, we think it’s a better use of our limited resources to focus on stories they’re missing. This year, that included a prominent nanoscientist who retracted a paper after PhD students found an error, the delisting of 19 Hindawi journals from a leading index, and a Yale history professor whose first book misrepresents primary sources, according to other scholars. (And if you want to help us cover even more stories in 2024, it’s not too late to make an <a href="http://paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/1909130">end-of-year tax-deductible contribution</a>!)</p>



<p>The following list reflects the stories that grabbed our readers’ attention the most in 2023:  </p>



<span id="more-128471"></span>



<ol>
<li>A researcher used ChatGPT to generate a paper on millipedes and posted it to a preprint server not once, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/01/withdrawn-ai-written-preprint-on-millipedes-resurfaces-causing-alarm/">but twice</a>. The affair came to light when another scientist got an email notification that the preprint cited his work–but some of the papers he’d supposedly written didn’t exist. Staff at the preprint server <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/07/publisher-blacklists-authors-after-preprint-cites-made-up-studies/">pulled down the paper</a>, which the corresponding author later reposted to a different server, still with fictitious references.&nbsp;</li>



<li>After the open-access publisher MDPI complained about an article in <em>Research Evaluation</em> classifying some of its journals as “predatory,” the offending article was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/08/article-that-assessed-mdpi-journals-as-predatory-retracted-and-replaced/">retracted and replaced</a> with a version with softer conclusions. Language throughout the article was changed to describe the findings less definitively, although some critical language remained.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Paul Weiss, a high-profile nanoscientist and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/09/prominent-nanoscientist-has-paper-retracted-after-phd-students-flagged-error/">retracted an article</a> after three doctoral students, one of whom was an author of the original study, flagged an issue with a measurement. The original data were lost, the authors said, and they’d not yet been able to replicate the experiments.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Nineteen Hindawi journals were <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">removed</a> from Clarivate’s Web of Science in March, and the hits just kept coming for Wiley, which bought the open-access publisher in 2021. Wiley <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">retracted</a> more than 8,000 Hindawi articles linked to paper mills this year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/02/hindawi-shuttering-four-journals-overrun-by-paper-mills/">closed</a> four journals, and lost an estimated $35-40 million revenue in the current fiscal year.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Late last year, a notorious paper with capital Ts apparently pasted onto a graph as error bars <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/22/that-paper-with-the-t-error-bars-was-just-retracted/">was retracted</a> from a special issue in a Hindawi journal. The Ts attracted lots of attention on twitter.com, but they were just the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/05/a-paper-used-capital-ts-instead-of-error-bars-but-wait-theres-more/">most obvious strange thing</a> about the paper. The journal that published the article was one of the 19 Hindawi titles Clarivate later delisted from Web of Science.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Anca Turcu, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, found an “unpleasant surprise” when going over her publication stats earlier this year: a paper with her name on it that she hadn’t written, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse">we found</a> had plagiarized another article. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/26/frankly-abusive-more-questions-about-the-journal-that-stole-an-authors-identity/">later heard</a> from the academic listed as editor in chief of the journal that published the article in Turcu’s name, who told us he also was “not associated with the journal in any way.”&nbsp;</li>



<li>The journal <em>Genetika</em>, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/28/truly-devastating-four-journals-wont-get-new-impact-factors-this-year-because-of-citation-shenanigans/">lost its impact factor</a> and spot in Clarivate’s Web of Science index this year, made good on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/17/journal-to-retract-papers-that-cost-its-impact-factor/">a promise</a> to retract dozens of papers with “compromised” peer review. Its retraction notice for the 31 articles and a corrigendum also stated that the journal had blacklisted the authors and reviewers of the papers.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The first book of a Yale professor of Chinese history “fails to meet basic academic standards” and is “filled with misinformation,” <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/25/yale-professors-book-systematically-misrepresents-sources-review-claims/">according to a no-holds-barred review</a>. Two other <a href="https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=59763&amp;fbclid=IwAR1_AqpZuSNuys2_CBIoJ3Ol6_4qhZURXnJ3VkfmptvivcXh6A-3EHkSeNg">critical</a> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-royal-asiatic-society/article/abs/uncertainty-in-the-empire-of-routine-the-administrative-revolution-of-the-eighteenthcentury-qing-state-by-maura-dykstra-xxxv-262-pp-cambridge-ma-harvard-university-asia-center-2022/17D7C62E9E6DE2A877A04D9234868196">reviews</a> were subsequently published. The book’s author recently <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-chinese-history/article/abs/response-to-george-qiaos-review-of-uncertainty-in-the-empire-of-routine-the-administrative-revolution-of-the-eighteenthcentury-qing-state/94C301F9EEE0DF4DBBDCE5A66EC7CAA5">published a response</a> in the same journal that ran the initial review, in which she “rebut[s] the reviewer’s false claims that the book is full of errors and that I have committed academic malfeasance.”&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lara S. Hwa, an assistant professor of neuroscience at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/19/alcohol-researcher-faked-data-in-animal-studies-us-watchdog-says">faked data</a> in two published studies and two grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), according to the U.S. Office of Research Integrity. One of the articles, published while she was a postdoc, has been retracted. Its notice stated the authors determined the published data “did not match the raw data values,” and after re-analyzing the raw data, “there were multiple changes in statistical significance, leading to an overall change in the interpretation of the results.”&nbsp;</li>



<li>A former chemistry professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/29/former-alabama-chemistry-prof-faked-data-in-grant-applications-federal-watchdog/">admitted to reusing data</a> in four grant applications to the NIH while claiming that it came from different experiments, according to another ORI finding. She agreed to have any federally funded work supervised for four years.</li>

<p><em>We are pleased to present an excerpt from </em><a href="https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0364"><em>The Predatory Paradox: Ethics, Politics, and Practices in Contemporary Scholarly Publishing</em></a><em> by Amy Koerber, Jesse C. Starkey, Karin Ardon-Dryer, R. Glenn Cummins, Lyombe Eko, and Kerk F. Kee, published by Open Book Publishers, October 2023.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In 2015, Johannes Bohannon, along with three coauthors, published an article titled<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chocolate_with_high_Cocoa_content_as_a_weight-loss_accelerator.pdf"> ‘Chocolate with High Cocoa Content as a Weight Loss Accelerator’</a> in the <em>International Archives of Medicine</em>. The article reported results from a study that divided participants into three groups, with a different diet assigned to each group, and concluded that ‘Subjects of the chocolate intervention group experienced the easiest and most successful weight loss’ (p. 1). </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-1707251800">personal account</a> published later, journalist John Bohannon described the article as an intentional hoax that he and his coauthors had carried out in response to a request from a German film crew who was making a documentary on the ‘junk-science diet industry.’ To implement the hoax, Bohannon and his coauthors created an ‘Institute of Diet and Health’ that existed only as a website, and he assumed the name ‘Johannes Bohannon’ as lead author of the study. As he explained, the research reported in the article was actually conducted, but it was “terrible science,” including major flaws that would have been detected if the article had undergone a legitimate peer-review process.</p>



<p>Bohannon and his colleagues’ ‘Chocolate with High Cocoa Content’ article was retracted shortly after it was published, and the editors of International Archives of Medicine published a <a href="http://imed.pub/ojs/index.php/iam/article/view/1087">retraction notice</a> dated 10 June 2015 (Editorial Office 2015). The editors’ decision to retract this article ostensibly served to correct the scientific record and prevent the erroneous data reported in the published study from being circulated in subsequent literature. This manner of correcting the scientific record is an important purpose of retractions, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/J.MATURITAS.2009.09.018">as defined by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>:</p>



<span id="more-128446"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Retraction is a mechanism for correcting the literature and alerting readers to publications that contain such seriously flawed or erroneous data that their findings and conclusions cannot be relied upon. Unreliable data may result from honest error or from research misconduct. (Wager and others 2009: 202)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although the editors’ retraction of Bohannon’s hoax article seems to correct the scientific record, it does not entirely align with these COPE guidelines. For example, the editors’ language in the retraction notice is confusing. The retraction notice published on the journal’s website states that the manuscript had been published ‘accidentally’ and that it ‘was finally rejected and never published as such.’ Furthermore, the journal editors did not fully follow the COPE guidelines, which state that ‘Notices of retraction should… be linked to the retracted article wherever possible (i.e., in all electronic versions)’ (Wager and others 2009: 201). It is not clear why, but in this case, the retracted article is no longer available at the journal’s website. </p>



<p>In fact, making the situation even more confusing, the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the original article now links to a study called ‘The Comparison of Resilience and Spirituality in Addicted and Non-Addicted Women’ (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3823/1654">Ramezani and others 2015</a>). This is extremely problematic, given that the sole purpose of a DOI is to provide a unique and persistent identifier that links to a published article, and it is the publisher’s responsibility to maintain the integrity of that link (‘<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-07-22/online-extra-how-the-digital-object-identifier-works%23xj4y7vzkg">How the ‘Digital Object Identifier’ Works</a>’ 2001). In short, this retraction seems to be intended as a ‘mechanism for correcting the literature’, as the COPE guidelines advise, but the error that needed to be corrected was not an error made by researchers; rather, it was, according to this retraction notice, an error made by the publisher.</p>



<p>The series of events preceding the article’s retraction is also subject to dispute. According to a 28 May 2015 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/28/should-the-chocolate-diet-sting-study-be-retracted-and-why-the-coverage-doesnt-surprise-a-news-watchdog/">Retraction Watch post</a>, the hoax article was available on the journal’s website on the morning of 28 May but appears to have been retracted later that same day (Schwitzer 2015). A 28 May 2015 <a href="https://books.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/obp.0364/ch4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor059:~:text=%5D%2C%20https%3A//www.facebook.com/groups/iamedicine/posts/10153415208752082/">Facebook post</a> (Perez 2015) from someone who appears to be one of the journal’s editors also indicates the article was retracted on that same date. By contrast, the <a href="http://imed.pub/ojs/index.php/iam/article/view/1087">retraction notice</a> that appears on the journal’s website (Editorial Office 2015) indicates 10 June 2015 as the publication date of the notice; it is not clear why the retraction notice would be published almost two weeks after the article was retracted on 28 May. </p>



<p>In addition to this confusion about the date of retraction, these different sources also offer varying accounts of the series of events that preceded retraction. Perez’s Facebook post suggests that the article was never accepted by the journal — that it was published ‘by mistake’, based on a misunderstanding of a managing editor who had been copied on Bohannon’s initial email submission. The Facebook post even claims that sometime after the article was accidentally published due to this miscommunication, ‘the manuscript was rejected by the editorial board.’ However, Bohannon offers a different narrative of events. He quotes an email acceptance notice that is also <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/28/chocolate-diet-study-publisher-claims-paper-was-actually-rejected-only-live-for-some-hours-email-however-says/">quoted by Retraction Watch</a>. In this personal email correspondence that Bohannon had apparently shared with Retraction Watch, the journal editors praised Bohannon and his colleagues’ article for its high quality and potential contributions:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I’m contacting to let you know your manuscript ‘Chocolate with High Cocoa Content as a Weight-Loss Accelerator’ has been pointed by our editors as an outstanding manuscript and could be accepted directly in our premier journal *International Archives of Medicine.* (McCook 2015)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adding even more confusion, Perez’s Facebook post was edited on 10 June 2015, almost two weeks after its initial 28 May publication, to add the second paragraph, which seems to be an attempt to account for the journal’s problematic set of actions. This 10 June edit also contributes to a discrepancy about the length of time that the fake article was available on the journal’s website. For instance, Perez’s (2015) Facebook post suggests it was online for only a few days (from Thursday one week to Monday of the next week, with no specific dates given). However, Retraction Watch indicates that the article was accepted soon after Bohannon submitted it in early March and was not retracted until 28 May 2015.</p>



<p>It may be easy to look at this situation in retrospect and conclude that so many problems are apparent in this article that no one could ever take it seriously, and because it was retracted and is no longer available, its damage was minimal. In fact, any science journalist or academic researcher who took time to assess the International Archives of Medicine’s online presence would have had good reason to question the credibility of this journal. </p>



<p>For instance, a search in PubMed Central’s journal list reveals that the journal was indexed from 2008 until 2014 but is ‘no longer participating’ (‘PMC Journal List’ [n.d.]). Articles published in the journal are full of grammatical errors, indicating a lack of attention to copy editing, at the very least, and probably indicating an absence of peer review as well. The journal publishes a lot of articles on a wide range of topics. </p>



<p>For example, Volume 14, published in 2014, includes fifty articles. These are indexed in PubMed Central as the entire volume, without any indication of issue numbers. Categories include Case Reports, Hypothesis, Original Research, Reviews, and Short Reports. The journal website linked from its current publisher, <a href="http://imedicalpublisher.com/">iMedicalPublisher.com</a>, describes the journal as ‘The new megajournal on all areas of medicine’, and says the journal is ‘Really international’ (‘International Archives of Medicine’ [n.d.]). These obvious cues should be enough to raise questions about the journal’s legitimacy, even aside from the glaring scientific flaws already noted in the hoax article itself. </p>



<p>However, none of these factors, and even the fact that the article was retracted, were obvious enough to stop the article from being cited in subsequent literature. In fact, when this chapter was written, the article had been cited twenty-eight times, according to Google Scholar. Although some of these citations refer to the article as an example of a publication in a predatory journal, other citations are in legitimate journal articles that genuinely cite the scientific findings reported in the article. Specifically, as shown in Table 4.1, almost one-third of these citations (eight out of twenty-eight) cite the article to support a scientific claim.</p>



<p>None of the eight publications that cite the Bohannon hoax article to support scientific claims acknowledges that the publication was retracted, even though all these publications appeared well after the 10 June 2015 publication date of the International Archives of Medicine’s retraction notice. Instead, these eight publications cite the Bohannon hoax article as if it were any other legitimate peer-reviewed scientific text. For example, a 2017 review article (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/6/4/84">Ramos and others 2017</a>) cites the Bohannon study, along with several other sources, to support the claim that appears in the following sentence: ‘In addition, despite the fact that cocoa products commercially available are frequently high-caloric foodstuffs, they have been reported to have a similar [anti-obesity] effect in humans’ (p. 5). The note that cites the Bohannon and others article includes a CrossRef link that links to the DOI, which now links to a different article, as noted above. This 2017 review article, interestingly, is published in the journal Antioxidants, which is published by MDPI.</p>



<p>The Bohannon hoax article is also cited in another article (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/4/812">Rodríguez-Lagunas and others 2019</a>) published in the MDPI journal Molecules. This article cites the Bohannon hoax article to support the claim that ‘anti-obesity actions of cocoa have been reported’ (p. 7). Oddly, the Bohannon hoax article is also cited at the end of the following sentence, which does not seem to have anything to do with the findings reported by Bohannon and his coauthors: ‘Regarding the health questionnaire, the university students reported, logically, a good health status, far away from suffering chronic diseases involving neoplasm and cardiovascular diseases, the main causes of death in the Spanish population’ (p. 8). These citations of the Bohannon hoax article, well after it was retracted and without any acknowledgement that it was a hoax, raise some serious concerns about the quality of content published in these two MDPI journals. It appears, at least in these two cases, that authors are citing literature without paying much attention to its quality — or maybe without even reading the texts they are citing — and peer reviewers are not catching these sloppy citation practices.</p>



<p>Another citation of Bohannon and others appears in a 2019 article in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b07248">Camps-Bossacoma and others 2019</a>). This article, ‘Role of Theobromine in Cocoa’s Metabolic Properties in Healthy Rats’, links to the Bohannon hoax article through Google Scholar instead of CrossRef, but like the other citations, this one cites the study without any acknowledgement that it is fraudulent or that it has been retracted. Specifically, the Bohannon hoax article is cited in the following sentence: ‘Cocoa effects on body weight increase have already been reported both in animal models and humans, […] and it has been postulated that cocoa is a weight loss accelerator’ (p. 3611). Unlike the other two journals, published by MDPI, this journal is published by the American Chemical Society, described on its website as follows: ‘As a non-profit scientific organization with more than 140 years’ experience, we are a champion for chemistry, its practitioners and our global community of members’ (‘About ACS’ [n.d.]). </p>



<p>This organizational affiliation may seem to grant legitimacy to the journal. Again, though, it is troubling that the Bohannon hoax study is cited uncritically, as a source within the authoritative scientific record, to support a statement about cocoa’s weight-loss properties. This must lead us to question the overall legitimacy of the article and the soundness of the science that it reports.</p>



<p>Persistent citation of retracted articles is not uncommon. In fact, Retraction Watch keeps a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/top-10-most-highly-cited-retracted-papers/">list of retracted articles</a> that have received the highest number of citations (‘Top 10 Most Highly Cited Retracted Papers’ [n.d.]). As of the publication of this book, the top article on the list was published in 2013 in the New England Journal of Medicine and retracted in 2018 (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1200303">Estruch and others 2013</a>). The Retraction Watch site reports that the article has 2735 citations. Next on their list is a Lancet article published in 1998 and retracted in 2018; Retraction Watch indicates 1509 citations of this article. </p>



<p>A recent study exposes the serious nature of this problem by examining a high-profile retraction case that involved the work of Scott S. Reuben (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/S11948-015-9680-Y">Bornemann-Cimenti and others 2016</a>). Reuben was a well-established medical researcher who studied pain medicine. In 2009, it was discovered that he had fabricated data in many of his published studies, which led journals to retract twenty-five of his published articles. Bornemann-Cimenti and others (2016) track the extent to which Reuben’s articles continued to accrue citations for many years after they were retracted. Although some of the citations note that the article has been retracted, many do not (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/PNAS.2119086119">Peng and others 2022</a>).</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/APPLIN/20.3.341">Hyland</a> (1999), ‘the attribution of propositional content to another source’ (p. 341) is a fundamental rhetorical feature of academic writing. Problematic citation practices include the citation of retracted articles, before or after the article is retracted (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2021.1886933">Bolland and others 2022</a>); citation, knowingly or unknowingly, of articles published in predatory journals (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ACALIB.2021.102366">Akça and Akbulut 2021</a>); or citing an article without having read it (Akça and Akbulut 2021; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1556/SCIENT.67.2006.3.2">Wetterer 2006</a>). Offering an especially concerning example, Wetterer tells the story of an outright falsehood that was perpetuated for many years among ant scientists, about the extinction of a particular ant species that allegedly occurred on the Atlantic Islands of Madeira due to the invasion of an exotic species. According to Wetterer’s analysis, this myth was perpetuated and became accepted as scientific fact reported in peer-reviewed journal articles because of practices that he labels ‘quotation error and citation copying’ (p. 352). </p>



<p>In short, scientists were repeating the myth that this species had been made extinct, based on a misinterpretation of an 1898 article (Stoll 1898) that ended up being widely cited as the source of this information. Wetterer speculates that Stoll’s report was misinterpreted because his article was published in German, and the person who initially cited it mistranslated his findings; thus, the erroneous belief that Stoll’s report was based on first-hand evidence became widely cited in subsequent literature, even though, according to Wetterer, Stoll never claimed to have access to first-hand evidence. </p>



<p>Thus, like many of the other phenomena explored in this book, the phenomenon of sloppy citation practices is nothing new; it is well documented in science, and the phenomenon of poor citation practices has been documented and studied well before the relatively recent development and proliferation of predatory journals. In the case of the Bohannon hoax, articles that cited it later are articles that were presumably subject to actual peer review, and they link directly to the Bohannon and others’ study, which was retracted shortly after it was published, without acknowledging that it was retracted. An especially puzzling aspect of this case is that it is not clear how the authors of these articles would have located a correct version of Bohannon and others’ study, given that its DOI — which is supposed to provide a unique and persistent link to a digital publication — does not even link correctly to the retracted article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short, the Bohannon ‘Chocolate with High Cocoa Content’ hoax may have been designed to expose substandard publishing practices at predatory journals, but it ultimately exposed a much larger, more complex set of problems. Everything was broken in this situation, including the various checks and balances that are expected to detect bad science and prevent it from being shared with the public. The science reported in this article was conducted, but it was conducted poorly by anyone’s standards. A thorough peer review would have detected the obvious flaws in the research and would have prevented the paper from being published. </p>



<p>A proper retraction, meaning that the retraction notice would appear along with the original article at the original DOI, and a more careful vetting of the literature by scientists after the article was published, may have prevented the retracted article from subsequent citations. However, in addition to all these scientific problems, the science journalists who reported on the findings also should have done due diligence by asking questions to relevant experts about the science behind the article.</p>



<p>Retractions of published articles are not uncommon, even at journals that are not predatory. In fact, the frequency of article retractions is on the rise, and even the most prestigious journals in their respective disciplines are not immune (Bornemann-Cimenti and others 2016). The extent to which the citation of a retracted article will alter the course of science depends on the nature of the evidence that is cited. If the evidence is in line with most other evidence, then the effect may not be too great, but if it is the only study that is cited to support a claim that departs from other available evidence, then this is obviously problematic. For all these reasons, retractions of published articles, whether they are published in a ‘predatory’ journal or not, are something that researchers and other stakeholders in scholarly publishing need to be aware of.</p>

<p>A journal says a content management mishap led to the publication, and subsequent retraction, of a gag essay not intended for wide distribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why the retraction happened three and a half years after the paper’s publication remains murky.</p>



<p>This story belongs to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, back when <em>Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics</em>, a Wiley title, used to gather spoof papers for its annual April Fools edition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Kristofer Barr,<strong> </strong>an assistant research integrity auditor at Wiley, told us:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128456"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The “April Fools” series was a longstanding tradition promoted on Proteins’ homepage, which included humorous editorials written by members of the research community. The intention of these editorials was to present a humorous take on an important topic in the field. Each article went through a process by which they were made into PDFs and these PDFs were promoted on a separate page on the journal’s website apart from other content published in Early View or in-issue. The editorials were never intended to be published alongside research content nor indexed in PubMed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But one such manuscript, “Citius, Altius, Fortius,” managed somehow to jump from house organ to the real journal, spoiling the fun for everyone. The title of the cheeky paper refers to the motto for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citius,_Altius,_Fortius">Olympic games</a> – “Faster, Higher, Stronger.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The piece was written by Joanna Lange and Gert Vriend, of Radboud University Medical Centre in The Netherlands. (Vriend also appears to be affiliated with the Baco Institute of Protein Science, in the Philippines.) </p>



<p>The episode reminds us a bit of one of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/08/12/the-shroud-of-retraction-virology-journal-withdraws-paper-about-whether-christ-cured-a-woman-with-the-flu/">our earliest posts</a>, back in 2010, about the retraction of a paper from a virology journal which speculated – with tongue in cheek –&nbsp; that Jesus had healed a febrile woman of her bout of flu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.12345">abstract for the spoof</a>, which reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>2020 is a leap year. That means that we have one day extra and, if the Olympic games had survived the corona crisis, we would all be watching television and ask the eternal question whether Olympic records will for ever be broken and broken again, or that there are limits to human biology1 . In this article we ask the same question, but rather than discussing aspects of Citius, Altius, and Fortius of athletes we will discuss them for macromolecules. It is remarkable how many parallels can be found between Olympic records in these two seemingly different worlds. People involved in structure validation and re-refinement try to make us believe that most aspects of macromolecular structures can be caught by a number that has some constant value with little variation around it. We will show here that the PDB2 databank proves this idea to be wrong. In the protein structure world, it holds for many that &#8220;participating is more important than winning&#8221;, but some, fortunately, still go for the record books.</p>

<p>Cheating is a favourite pass-time for many, especially when feeling that we can get away with it&nbsp; (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_returns_of_Donald_Trump). But cheating happens&nbsp; everywhere else too; like in the Olympics (https://www.britannica.com/list/8-olympic-cheating- scandals) and, amazingly, even in crystallography13-16. The Olympic games have been marred by a large number of doping abuse cases, and the number of athletes caught increase from games to games (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_at_the_Olympic_Games). The systematic country-wide doping abuse of East-Germany, though, remained undetected too long to be backed up by physical evidence. Something similar is going on in crystallography. In pre-history, structures were built by hand (see e.g. Figure 1) and cheating was difficult because one could always check the conclusions by travelling to the lab that built the model, and remeasure everything.</p>



<p>Protein models as they were built in the good old days; before computers came around to spoil the fun. These metal models had one big problem, all residues of a certain type always had the same bond lengths and bond angles. (Figure courtesy A Finkelstein)&nbsp; At some moment, though, computers became available, and from then on crystallographers could cheat much more eloquently by using refinement software with restraints and constraints, and parameter sets like those of Engh and Huber. Fortunately, not all crystallographers do this …</p>

<p>Unless you’re a protein scientist, the humor here is likely to fall a bit flat. The funniest part of the piece, as far as we can tell, is the disclosure statement:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These authors contributed equally little to this work.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were surprised to find the paper has been cited (just once), according to Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. The reference seems not to indicate the authors knew the article was a lark.</p>



<p>Wiley didn’t catch the rogue publication until this year, during an internal audit. Per Barr:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In late 2023, a team member noticed the erroneous publication of one of these editorials, which was likely the result of a miscommunication within our production staff. Our integrity group, following COPE guidelines, advised that it was necessary to retract the article.&nbsp; The Editor-in-Chief of Proteins and both authors agreed that the mistakenly-published editorial would receive a retraction, and we thank them for their quick action to help correct the record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nikolay Dokholyan, the editor-in-chief of <em>Proteins</em>, lamented the joke gone wrong:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The story of this article is just a set of unfortunate events. Wiley published it accidentally. We had a tradition of April’s fool articles, which are not for publication. Wiley made a mistake and published it. Upon revealing the mistake, they fixed it. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with the science. Wiley has a problem mixing humor and science since it may make erroneous perceptions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In fact, the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.26649">retraction notice</a> appears to suggest blame for the error lies with the editors:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The above article, published online on 12 June 2020 in Wiley Online Library (<a href="http://wileyonlinelibrary.com/">wileyonlinelibrary.com</a>), has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal&#8217;s Editor-in-Chief Dr. Nikolay Dokholyan, and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. The above article is a humorous editorial contribution surrounding a specialized topic, and was not intended for full online publication as part of the journal&#8217;s scholarly content. Due to an editorial mistake, the above article was published online in Early View. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. takes full responsibility for the erroneous publication of this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Regardless, Dokholyan confirmed April is no longer a month of mirth at his journal – no more jokes about misfolded proteins in its pages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>we stopped this tradition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Barr added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Upon agreement with the Editor-in-Chief and the lead author of this series, we have taken steps to move previous “April Fools Day” editorials to a separate platform, which will ensure the articles are presented in context and will not be mistaken as genuine scholarly content. Before this incident, the journal had already intended to retire the April Fools series.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Vriend told us he had been submitting the joke pieces for a decade before the one that went awry:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I will indeed miss it a bit. But, to be honest, I was/am running out of ideas. This year I had still something nice, there is a relation (not correlation, and hopefully nothing causal) between the style of the american president and the length and spread in the length of bond-lengths in amino acid side-chains&#8230; &nbsp; But the world will never learn about this amazing fact&#8230;</p>

<p>Larks may be carefree, but science may be deaf to their songs.</p>

<p>Reindeer can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.12.012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eat and sleep at the same time</a>, a new study suggests. This timesaving strategy, described December 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>, adds to the number of ingenious ways <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinstrap-penguins-sleep-seconds-micronaps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animals can catch some z’s</a> under tough conditions (<em>SN: 11/30/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arctic reindeer are quite busy in the summer — eating when the sun shines around the clock and the food is abundant. Like other ruminants, reindeer spend a considerable amount of time chewing on regurgitated food, making it smaller and easier to digest. Finding time to sleep amid all this cud chewing might be tough. But not if the reindeer could sleep while they chewed. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To find out if the reindeer could actually sleep-eat, neuroscientist Melanie Furrer and chronobiologist Sara Meier, along with their colleagues, trained four female Eurasian tundra reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus tarandus</em>) to tolerate a pen and electrodes on shaved patches of skin. The process involved some kicks and lots of lichen treats, “which is like candy to them,” says Meier, of the University of Zurich.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers were looking for the brain waves that appear during non-REM sleep, a deep, restorative sleep phase. These waves appeared when the reindeer were chewing cud, though the chewing motion itself made it hard to say whether the signal was identical to that of a regular sleep session. “We couldn’t go into detail by looking only at the brain waves, because we have this chewing in there that disturbs it a bit,” says Furrer, also of the University of Zurich.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, other signs also pointed to sleep while chewing. The reindeer were calm while chewing, often with their eyes closed. “They were in a very relaxed state that resembles the body position of non-REM sleep,” Furrer says. Ruminating reindeer were also harder to disturb; rustling from neighboring reindeer was less likely to get a look from a ruminating reindeer. When reindeer are kept awake, they need catch-up recovery sleep. But time spent chewing decreased this time spent in recovery sleep, the researchers found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, these strands of evidence “convincingly demonstrate that reindeer are able to sleep while ruminating,” says neurobiologist Niels Rattenborg of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Seewiesen, Germany, who was not involved in the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike fur seals, ducks and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frigate-birds-fly-nonstop-months" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-haul flying frigatebirds</a>, the reindeer show signs of sleeping with both sides of their brains while chewing (<em>SN: 6/30/16</em>). Figuring out exactly how reindeer pull this off would be interesting, Rattenborg says. Studying various forms of sleep might lead to insights on sleep walking in people, “a poorly understood and potentially dangerous sleep disorder,&#8221; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neuroscientist and study coauthor Gabi Wagner notes that Indigenous reindeer herders have a concept that roughly translates to “pasture peace.” Reindeer “need time and space to be quiet and to have peace, to ruminate,&#8221; says Wagner, of the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research in Tromsø. “This paper for the first time shows that this is a very real, physiological requirement to have enough peace to ruminate undisturbed in order to cover the sleep requirements.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, let’s all be cheered that reindeer can take good care of themselves. Some of them might be busy this Christmas Eve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/give-a-good-gift-science">Here’s how to give a good gift, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>‘Tis the season of giving. ‘Tis also the season of returning.</p>



<p>American consumers are projected to spend roughly $960 billion this holiday season, according to the National Retail Federation. But retailers expect returns to account for almost <a href="https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/winter-holidays/winter-holiday-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 percent</a> of those sales.</p>



<p>That return frenzy arises, at least in part, because people tend to make a lot of mistakes when giving presents, says Julian Givi, a marketing expert and psychologist who has been studying gifting practices, and when they go awry, for roughly a decade.</p>



<p>When Givi went into this line of research, he assumed that gift givers were simply motivated by a desire to please recipients. Not so much, he quickly discovered. Instead, people often give gifts that satisfy their own desires — for uniqueness, societal approval or as a gag — rather than the desires of recipients, says Givi, of West Virginia University in Morgantown.</p>



<p>In other words, people would be a whole lot better at giving gifts if they could just get their own egos out of the way. Givi and colleagues reviewed research into <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all things gift giving</a> in the July <em>Journal of Consumer Psychology.</em></p>



<p>Giving good gifts may not seem like a research-worthy topic. But positive gift exchanges can help businesses struggling to deal with the sheer volume of returns, as well as cement social relationships. Perhaps most importantly, giving better gifts could take pressure off the environment. By <a href="https://theconversation.com/fast-fashion-why-your-online-returns-may-end-up-in-landfill-and-what-can-be-done-about-it-188090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one estimate</a>, in 2020, some 2.6 million tons of returned products in the United States wound up in a landfill.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke to Givi about research on gift giving — and how that translates to advice to help last-minute shoppers avoid common gifting pitfalls this holiday season. <em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Your review touches on the many ways that gift givers go astray due to social norms. Can you provide some examples?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>There’s probably hundreds of norms in gift giving. Generally, givers tend to overweigh the importance of these given norms. For example, we would never want to give a used thing. But for recipients, if this used thing is what they want to receive, that’s fine. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another example is gift wrapping. Say we have $50 to spend. We could either spend $40 on the gift and $10 on the gift wrapping or we could spend $50 on the gift and nothing on gift wrapping. We tend to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618761373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go with the nicer wrapping</a>. Recipients would rather have $10 put into the gift. But the norm out there says wrap and present your gift nicely.</p>



<p>Or consider partial gifts. For example, you go to a wedding registry. You see that the couple requested eight dinner plates. Each dinner plate is $25. You can give them $100 worth of dinner plates but you are only giving them four out of the eight things. As givers we don’t like giving gifts that aren’t complete. But recipients don’t mind as much as we think.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: One seeming success story in people overriding norms involves experiential gifts. Can you explain?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>There are a few different papers on this topic. One shows that <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we don’t give experiential gifts</a> as often as recipients want. Another shows that the majority of the time people give material gifts, but experiences actually <a href="https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/1017575/volumes/v42/NA-42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make people happier</a> than material gifts. That’s a finding throughout the consumer world. It’s called the experiential advantage. A third finding is that experiential gifts <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/43/6/913/2632328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring recipients closer to givers</a> than to material items.</p>



<p>I think this is a rare instance in which academics and society have converged. The academic side is saying experiences are really valued as gifts at the same time as a societal push in recent years against materialism.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You wrote in an article in <em>The Conversation </em>about how givers should <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-4-biggest-gift-giving-mistakes-according-to-a-consumer-psychologist-195169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resist the urge to give a novelty item</a> like a chocolate fondue fountain. Why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>This falls under temporal focus. Gift givers tend to focus on that “aha” moment, the moment when the ribbons and bow come off. Recipients focus more on long-term utility. Research shows that people are misguided on how much surprise is important. Recipients actually like things that they request better.</p>



<p>The chocolate fondue fountain is an example that I think makes so much sense. Sure a person would go ‘Wow, a chocolate fondue fountain!’ But think about how often throughout the year they might use that. Whereas if somebody gave them a coffee maker, they’d be thrilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What are some of the gaps in this area of research?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>The vast majority of these studies were also done in either the U.S. or maybe U.K. What I can say is that cultural norms trump my study findings.</p>



<p>For instance, we oftentimes give superficial gifts around the holidays. But what we find is that recipients actually prefer sentimental gifts more than what givers anticipate. Part of the reason this mismatch occurs is because superficial gifts are a pretty safe bet. I live in Pittsburgh, for example. If I give someone a Steelers jersey, I know that they are going to appreciate it to some extent. If I give someone a scrapbook for photographs of the two of us, it could be great or it could be weird.</p>



<p>But if in a culture if you are going to get ridiculed for giving a sentimental gift, then I would say don’t give a sentimental gift.</p>



<p>Another limitation on this body of work is that it’s focused on adults. It’s a lot easier to get [institutional review board] approval to do research on people who are 18 and older.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What about times when you know the recipient wants that new, non-sentimental and non-experiential gift under the tree?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>We are studying at the population level, or on average what gift givers should do versus not do. But there are individual differences. Even if on average this research is saying givers should go with the used thing, if the giver knows they are dealing with someone who would very much not appreciate used things, it’s certainly fine to go against what the research is telling you.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How should gift givers handle picky or difficult recipients?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Givi: </strong>I don’t have an answer for you when it comes to very difficult people. My understanding of that research is that researchers have examined how givers behave when they are dealing with difficult recipients. But they don’t necessarily get the recipients’ perspective. It would probably be hard to get a bunch of difficult people to participate in a study.</p>



<p>But here’s something you could potentially do with a difficult recipient. One of my papers shows that it’s a lot easier to make people happy when you’re giving in the <a href="https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absence of a special occasion</a>. What we find in the paper is you can spend $10 on a random Tuesday in March giving a person a gift versus $50 on Christmas for gifts, and that generates similar levels of happiness.</p>



<p>What you could do with difficult people is sprinkle gifts throughout the year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/endangered-species-act-50-anniversary-success">The Endangered Species Act is turning 50. Has it succeeded?</a></h4>

              
                <p>While growing up in California in the 1980s, Winifred Frick never saw a condor in the wild. The population of North America’s largest bird, <em>Gymnogyps californianus</em>, had dwindled to nearly zero by 1987 because so many were shot, poisoned or captured.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The few remaining wild condors <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/last-wild-condor-caught">were brought into zoos</a> in the early 1980s as part of a captive breeding program aimed at restoring the condor population (<em>SN: 4/25/87</em>). A small group of the birds reproduced, and eventually many of the condors <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/california-condors-released-wild">were released back into the wild</a> (<em>SN: 1/25/92</em>).</p>



<p>Today, Frick — now a conservation biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz — and her 14-year-old son can admire soaring condors while hiking along the Pacific coast. Nearly 350 of these majestic scavengers, whose wings can span nearly 3 meters, once again fly over parts of California and Arizona.</p>



<p>The condors’ happy ending is thanks in large part to the U.S. Endangered Species Act, or ESA, enacted on December 28, 1973. The act currently protects <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/report/boxscore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 2,300 species</a>. This includes more than 900 plants and upwards of <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species-directory/threatened-endangered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">160 marine species</a>.</p>



<p>When it comes to preventing plants and animals from going extinct, the ESA is “one of the most powerful laws we have,” says Frick, who is also the chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group based in Austin, Texas. She should know: 12 bat species fall under ESA’s protection, and more than half of North America’s 154 bat species <a href="https://www.batcon.org/press/2023-north-american-state-of-the-bats-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are at risk of declining over the next 15 years</a>, according to the group’s 2023 report. The ESA is “about protecting wildlife for our future generations,” Frick says.</p>



<p>If a species is deemed threatened or endangered with going extinct, it goes through a rigorous vetting process to determine whether it should be added to the endangered species list. Once a species makes the list, government agencies create a plan to help it recover. This might mean describing ways to restore its habitat or identifying ways to halt threats to a species. For instance, being listed under the act makes it illegal to harass, kill or catch any of these organisms. It also bans the import of any endangered foreign animals, as well as any meat or products made from them.</p>



<p>The ESA has catalyzed plenty of success stories over the past half-century. It has helped large predators recover, including grizzly bears (<em>Ursus arctos horribilis</em>), gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and American alligators (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>).</p>



<p>It has also benefited tiny creatures, such as a brown snail called the <a href="https://www.doi.gov/photos/magazine-mountain-shagreen-snail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magazine Mountain shagreen</a> (<em>Inflectarius magazinensis</em>). In 2013, this snail became the first endangered invertebrate to graduate off the federal endangered species list. Its numbers recovered after the Arkansas forest where it lives was protected from logging and construction.</p>



<p>Thanks to the ESA, Southern California’s <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/2068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island night lizard</a> (<a href="https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/night-lizard.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xantusia riversiana</a>) — which has no eyelids — also has recovered. And on islands near Toledo, Ohio, the act has helped <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/8515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake Erie water snakes</a> (<em>Nerodia sipedon insularum</em>) slither back from the brink.</p>



<p>Some endangered plants have bounced back, too. In 1997, only 20,000 <a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2023-07/golden-paintbrush-delisted-endangered-species-act-due-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golden paintbrush</a> plants (<em>Castilleja levisecta</em>) remained in the wilds of Washington and Oregon. Now more than 325,000 of the bright wildflowers grow there — enough that the species no longer needs ESA protection. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, the act has helped <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/6803/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep 99 percent of species</a> under its protection from extinction, researchers concluded in a 2019 study in <em>Peer J</em>.</p>



<p>But it’s not all good news.</p>



<p>Across the globe, some <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one million species of plants and animals are at risk of going extinct</a>, warned a 2019 United Nations report. These species range from parrots and oak trees to giraffes and seaweed. As a U.S. law, the ESA can attempt to help only a small fraction of these.</p>



<p>For many of the species it can protect, the ESA tends to come into play too late in the game. If not given this protection soon enough, species that are now threatened could soon become endangered. And once they reach that critical state, they become far harder to save.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Species success stories</h4>



<p>Even amid its shortcomings, the ESA has racked up plenty of important wins for wildlife.</p>



<p>In 2014, the pinky-sized Oregon chub (<em>Oregonichthys crameri</em>) was the <a href="https://www.snexplores.org/article/first-living-fish-leaves-endangered-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first fish to graduate off the endangered species list</a> (<em>SNE: 2/13/14</em>). Only 1,000 of these silver minnows were left when the chub was put on ESA’s list in 1993. Landowners and government agencies restored bogs and ponds where these fish live. Then scientists reintroduced the chub to these places. Today, more than 160,000 of the tiny fish swim wild in Oregon’s Willamette River Valley.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="448" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121323_br_Endangered-Species-Act_inline3.jpg?resize=680%2C448&#038;ssl=1" alt="Two silvery fish swimming." class="wp-image-3134362" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121323_br_Endangered-Species-Act_inline3.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121323_br_Endangered-Species-Act_inline3.jpg?resize=581%2C383&amp;ssl=1 581w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121323_br_Endangered-Species-Act_inline3.jpg?resize=282%2C186&amp;ssl=1 282w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3134362">Tiny Oregon chub again swim through Northwest bogs and ponds, thanks to protections offered by the Endangered Species Act.

Swart/Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife/Flickr (CC BY-NC 2.0 DEED)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The status of 60 other species has improved enough that the ESA no longer lists them as endangered with extinction, though they remain listed as threatened with extinction. This is the case for the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/species/american-burying-beetle-nicrophorus-americanus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American burying beetle</a> (<em>Nicrophorus americanus</em>), a carrion beetle native to many states.</p>



<p>A great example of the act in action is how it has protected some of the world’s largest animals: whales. Eight whale species, including the humpback (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>), were among the first animals added to the U.S. endangered species list. In the North Pacific, whaling had reduced the number of humpbacks to an estimated 8 percent of their historic levels, from around 15,000 whales to just 1,200.</p>



<p>In 1985, with U.S. support, the <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/international-affairs/international-whaling-commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Whaling Commission</a> banned the commercial harvest of whales. Since then, nine out of 14 populations of humpbacks are no longer considered threatened.</p>



<p>One of the biggest humpback success stories is the Hawaiian-born population, which migrates each summer to dine in Alaska. Now numbering about 11,000 animals, they have “likely met or exceeded their historic abundance,” says Suzie Teerlink, a humpback whale biologist based in Juneau, Alaska, who works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>



<p>The Endangered Species Act gives whales and their habitats additional protections from other human-related threats, Teerlink points out. These include laws aimed at reducing injuries to whales from being struck by ships or tangled in fishing lines, such as enforcing speed limits for vessels in certain waters.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Criticism of ESA</h4>



<p>One important way that ESA protects at-risk plants and wildlife is by requiring the U.S. government to consider <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tough-choices">how development might affect threatened or endangered species</a> (<em>SN: 11/27/01</em>). Such projects could include new roads, bridges or pipelines, as well as logging, mining or building wind turbines.</p>



<p>This law &#8220;makes people stop and look first,” before they tear up or through the environment, says Derek Goldman, national field director out of Missoula, Mont., for the Endangered Species Coalition, a mix of 400 groups that works to protect imperiled species.</p>



<p>But this stop-and-look requirement has critics. “They believe it slows down development,” Goldman says. He stresses, however, that the ESA isn’t intended to prevent projects from happening. It just asks developers to find ways to limit harm to the local plants and animals that might be affected. For instance, the company developing <a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/vineyardwind-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s largest offshore wind project</a> 24 kilometers off the coast of Massachusetts is undertaking a host of actions to minimize its impacts on endangered marine species. This includes using bubble curtains to dampen construction noise, employing an observer to keep an eye out for endangered species during turbine installation, and driving their vessels slowly to prevent whale strikes.</p>



<p>Another criticism of the ESA is that, for many species, its protections come too late. As a case in point, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2023-10/21-species-delisted-endangered-species-act-due-extinction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took 21 species off the list</a> in October because they are now extinct. This includes eight species of&nbsp;birds endemic to Hawaii&nbsp;as well as eight species of freshwater mussels.</p>



<p>A 2022 study published in <em>PLOS ONE</em> found that most plants or animals on the endangered species list only<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275322" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> received protection after their numbers reached “dangerously low” levels</a>.</p>



<p>Under the law, species recommended for ESA listing should wait no more than two years before the U.S. government decides whether to list a species. However, for most species, that wait is longer — sometimes much longer, the study found. From 2010 to 2020, the median wait time was three years. In the 10 years before that, it was 9.1 years.</p>



<p>Overwhelmed government agencies are one reason for the delay in listing species, the study suggests. The more species recommended for listing, the longer the wait. It appears that in recent decades, agencies lacked enough people and money to move faster.</p>

<p>And, the study points out, for species “with very small or rapidly declining populations, a multi-year delay in receiving protection increases the risk of extinction.”</p>



<p>“The Endangered Species Act has two parallel goals,&#8221; says ecologist Erich Eberhard of Columbia University and coauthor of the <em>PLOS ONE </em>study. “One is to prevent the extinction of species. The other is to recover listed species.”</p>



<p>When it comes to that second goal, he says, the act “isn&#8217;t succeeding.” Just 3 percent of listed species have recovered enough to come off the list, Eberhard and his colleagues found.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Helping troubled species recover</h4>



<p>One way to help species rebound is to direct more money toward protecting them and their ecosystems. That’s why many biologists are championing the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recovering America’s Wildlife Act</a> as a companion law that could bolster species before they require listing under ESA.</p>



<p>This proposed law was introduced in the U.S. Senate in March. It would invest $1.4 billion each year to help states and tribal nations keep wildlife populations healthy. It would help pay for habitat conservation and state research programs. And that money would benefit more than just species on ESA’s list; it would also help out 12,000 species of concern on the lists of individual states. Such species include the monarch butterfly (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>), western bumble bee (<em>Bombus occidentalis</em>) and dwarf shrew (<em>Sorex nanus</em>).</p>



<p>If the Endangered Species Act is an emergency room for species whose numbers have gotten critically low, then the proposed law would provide preventive care, working to keep wildlife populations and their habitats healthy.</p>



<p>Frick of Bat Conservation International believes that passing the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act could be “a game changer” for conserving wildlife.</p>



<p>As ESA celebrates its 50th anniversary in December 2023, Frick hopes a lot more healthy species will “graduate” from an endangered status.</p>



<p>Teerlink, who focuses on ocean critters, agrees. “Extinction is forever. The future depends on us being considerate and intentional in what we leave behind.”</p>

<p>Pleading emails requesting papers are regular visitors to one’s inbox. These unsolicited and flattering requests promise rapid publication and tempt authors to part with their work. Even master’s and doctoral students, after graduation, receive sweet-talking requests to publish their dissertations as a book, a book chapter, or as a paper. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y">Predatory journals</a> and publishers are easy to spot and ignore at these low ends. </p>



<p>The danger lies with well-established and efficient predatory publishers. These ‘efficient’ publishers hide in the open on allowlists, such as South Africa’s Department of Higher Education and Training (DHETs) list of approved journals, and reputable indices such as Scopus and the WoS. They embellish their websites with claims of peer review and even state that they comply with <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.1.12">requirements</a> set by the Committee on Publication Ethics. Their websites tick all the boxes, providing a strong veneer of an authentic scholarly journal. </p>



<p>One of my colleagues alerted me to a suspected predatory publisher. I looked into the case and thought it sensible to share my results, with the hope of sensitising postgraduate students and fellow authors.</p>



<span id="more-128432"></span>



<p>I was asked to look at a suspicious acceptance letter from the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1994"><em>Journal of Namibian Studies</em></a> and a $365 invoice for article processing charges. The journal is listed on the 2023 DHET list of approved journals but was delisted by Scopus in 2023 due to quality issues. See Scopus’s <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/excel_doc/0015/91122/extlistJune2023.xlsx">Source Title List</a> for the discontinued titles.</p>



<p>Words in the journal’s acceptance letter, “to enlighten you” and “manuscript reviewed and appraised by the review committee members,” raised suspicion. In addition, the invoice requested payment to be made to a conference business in India. Payment to a business on the sub-continent is at odds with what one would expect from a journal with links to Namibia and Germany. For example, papers in volume 31 of the journal (2022) list a German academic as the editor, and academics from Namibia, Germany, and South Africa, amongst others, as editorial advisory board members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I explored further and discovered the following: The publisher changed on 1 January 2023 from Otjivanda Presse to the Society of Cultural Studies and Social Sciences (Hong Kong)<em>. </em>The <a href="https://namibian-studies.com/index.php/JNS/announcement/view/1">notice date</a> on the journal website is 16 May 2023. I was not able to trace this society on the Hong Kong government <a href="https://www.icris.cr.gov.hk/csci/">website</a> (a person must register before being able to search for a company). The invoice, in contrast, lists ARDA Conference Private Limited as the publisher. The new publisher also removed and replaced the editor, sub-editor, and editorial board members. For example, a <a href="https://namibian-studies.com/index.php/JNS/about/editorialTeam">Dr Jimmy</a> with no affiliation is listed as a new sub-editor.</p>



<p>Earlier papers, pre-2023, were in line with the journal’s narrow <a href="https://namibian-studies.com/index.php/JNS/about/">focus</a>, namely humanities and the social sciences, devoted exclusively to Namibian studies. The pre-2023 journal only published seven papers in 2021 and 14 papers in 2022, in addition to reviews and reports. The journal, under the new publisher, <a href="https://namibian-studies.com/index.php/JNS/issue/archive">produced</a> 224 papers by mid-July 2023 (the first two papers in 2023 were published by the original publisher). There are currently five special issues listed for 2023, with about 800 papers. Most of these papers are outside the journal’s scope and show no connection to Namibia. The original publisher’s copy-editing work is notably better when compared to the new publisher.</p>



<p>A visit to the Academic Research and Development (ARDA) <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/">website</a>, the journal’s new publisher, revealed a&nbsp; larger issue. Their website lists many journals that appear to be under their control – 39 of these journals, for example, are listed as Scopus-indexed. The new publisher’s <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1994">link</a> for the <em>Journal of Namibian Studies</em> informs a reader that acceptance is within two days, followed by publication in ten days. I looked at some journals on the ARDA&nbsp; website and noticed the same trend. Authors are promised acceptance within two days for the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1195"><em>Journal of Survey in Fisheries Sciences</em></a> and ten to 15 days for the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1192"><em>European Chemical Bulletin</em></a>. Both journals publish a large number of papers – most outside the journals’ scope. There is no editorial team for the <em>Journal of Survey in Fisheries Sciences</em> and an opaque and questionable editorial team for the <em>European Chemical Bulletin</em>. As with the <em>Journal of Namibian Studies</em>, the copy-editing work differs quality-wise from earlier editions. Both these journals are on the 2023 DHET accredited list.</p>



<p>ARDA promises rapid acceptance and publication for the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1193"><em>International Journal of Professional Business Review</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1195"><em>Journal of Survey in Fisheries Sciences</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1190"><em>Res Militaris</em></a>. Scopus discontinued these journals in 2023 but they are still on the 2023 DHETs list.</p>



<p>Another questionable journal under ARDAs control is the <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/journals/scopus-indexed/journal-details?jid=1191"><em>Russian Law Journal</em></a>. Scopus only covered this journal from <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/21100455574">2013 to 2021</a> but the journal still appears on Scopus’s <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/excel_doc/0015/91122/extlistJune2023.xlsx">Source Title List</a> and on the DHET list. I emailed <a href="https://www.russianlawjournal.org/index.php/journal/about/contact">Dr. Anna Dmitri</a>, “<a href="about:blank">Publisher and Owner RLJ</a>” and asked about article processing charges and how long it takes to publish a paper after submission.&nbsp; The Editorial Team replied: “Registration fee&nbsp;for an article&nbsp;is USD 190/ INR 17k. Your article will be published within 15 working days after completion of the registration process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>ARDA also provides <a href="https://www.ardaconference.com/thesis-writing-services">writing services</a>. Regarding thesis and dissertation writing, they promise to “deliver well-researched thesis papers without any mistakes and plagiarism. Thesis writing is, without a doubt, a challenging and time-consuming undertaking that requires a ton of time. With ARDA, you will get access to a global network of knowledgeable researchers who will assist your needs.”</p>



<p>Some predatory publishers and their <a href="https://doi.org/10.11613/BM.2021.030201">facilitators</a> operate in plain sight. The danger is no longer the poorly worded and pleading emails in our inboxes but journals with a respectable façade. We should not trust a journal at face value. Authentic scholarly journals, even those on reputable indices, may <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08999">discard appropriate editorial practices</a> and become income-generating instruments for their owners.</p>



<p>What I don’t know is how the publisher acquired the <em>Journal for Namibian Studies</em> and the other journals listed on their website. Were there hostile takeovers, did a founding editor unwittingly sell the journal, or cede control?</p>



<p>Selecting a journal for disseminating one’s work requires more than checking if the journal appears on the DHET’s list or a reputable index. We must sensitise ourselves to <a href="https://www.interacademies.org/project/predatorypublishing">predatory indicators</a> such as a high volume of papers, opaque editorial members, poor copy editing, papers outside a journal’s scope, and promises of rapid publication.</p>

<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects more than one in 100 people worldwide. ASD can be reliably diagnosed by the age of 2 years, but developmental screenings are expensive and not readily available for low- and middle-income economies. Since early detection is crucial for timely interventions and support, there is a need to find more cost-effective screening methods to assist under-resourced primary health care settings.</p>
<p>A new study published in <em>BMC Digital Health </em>introduces a time- and cost-efficient telehealth approach to detect behavioral differences between children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children using snack time activities. In this study, children aged 1-6 years, previously diagnosed with ASD, and TD children were filmed for one minute during structured snack time activities. Three clinical experts identified 17 ASD-related behaviors covering social interaction, communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. These were then further converted into 62 behavior indicators (e.g., counts, duration, rate) and translated into a behavior coding system.</p>
<p>Using this easy and cost-effective method, trained examiners were able to identify distinct behavioral differences between children with ASD and TD children. These included eye gaze, pointing, facial expressions, vocalization, verbalization, and giving behaviors. A clinical prediction model further confirmed the method’s ability to predict ASD with a sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 86.6%. While acknowledging the study&#8217;s limitations due to a relatively small sample size, the authors assert that their newly developed telehealth tool shows great promise for diagnosing ASD in primary health care settings in an easy, reliable, and cost-effective manner.</p>

<p>Biodiversity loss is one of the is the most pressing issues the world is currently facing. According to the WWF’s <a href="https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-GB/#:~:text=The%20Living%20Planet%20Report%202022,in%20species%20populations%20since%201970.">Living Planet Report 2022</a>, 69% of global wildlife populations have disappeared since 1970.  Human land use for food production is still the major driver of biodiversity loss, but climate change and rising temperatures play an increasingly significant role as well. Elevated temperatures change the availability and distribution of existing ecosystems, often forcing animals and plants to move to higher latitudes, where they further disrupt existing ecosystems. It is, therefore, crucial to take climate change into consideration when planning species conservation and management efforts.</p>
<p>In a study recently published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em>, researchers used species distribution models to predict the future extent of suitable habitats for geladas in the Ethiopian highlands. These high-altitude primates are extremely range-restricted and already in decline due to human disturbances. By comparing historic occurrence data collected after 1999 and considering a total of 13 environmental factors (e.g., climate change, land cover, and slope) the authors were able to create a model to predict where geladas might live under 2050 and 2070 climate change scenarios.</p>
<p>Their model revealed that, over the past two decades, geladas had already shifted to higher elevations as a response to agricultural expansion and significant anthropogenic pressures. It further confirmed that the geladas were highly vulnerable to global climate change and would lose a significant part of their current habitat. Factors like temperature, precipitation, and slope were most influential when shaping these projections. The authors concluded that taking predicted future habitat outlines into account to create protected areas would be crucial when planning conservation efforts for this species. In addition, given that geladas are already living in areas that are less ideal for them, protecting their current habitats is important, even if they will become unsuitable in the future.</p>

<p>The Faroe Islands, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, constitute an archipelago that operates as a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Many Faroese are descendants of Norwegian Vikings, who colonized the islands about 1200 years ago. Because of the remote nature of the islands, the population has remained relatively isolated, and genetic inbreeding has resulted in a high incidence of recessive allele disorders, such as the very rare Primary Carnitine Deficiency (PCD). Over the past decade, several nationwide screening programmes using whole genome and exome sequencing were initiated to better understand the occurrence of PCD and other rare diseases in the Faroese population.</p>
<p>A study in <em>BMC Genomics</em> used high-coverage data to explore the genomic variation and demographic history of the Faroese population. The analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from eight unrelated Faroese genomes, alongside runs of homozygosity (ROHs), minor allele frequency (MAF), and population structure, revealed intriguing differences. While all eight participants were deemed unrelated, a level of relatedness akin to sibling or parent-offspring pairs was detected. However, a closer look at ROHs suggested this relatedness had ancient origins. The study also revealed a bottleneck and inbreeding event, starting between the 1st and 4th century and peaking around the 6th century—about 2-3 centuries earlier than previously thought based on archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>While the sample size of this study was relatively small, the author is confident that most modern Faroese are likely descendants of primarily European farmers (&lt;99%) with a minor influence of Admixed Americans (&gt;1%). Due to the relative isolation of the islands, inbreeding remained high, providing an opportunity to study ancient communities through the modern Faroese population.</p>

<p>Unprofessional behaviors (UB) among healthcare staff represents a global problem, with a negative impact on staff well-being and patient safety. UB can be defined as “any interpersonal behavior by a staff member that acutely or frequently undermines, humiliates, intimidates, or drives distress or harm to other staff, in the healthcare workplace” and includes incivility, microaggressions, harassment, and bullying. While rates of UB vary worldwide, data consistently show that women, individuals with disabilities, and those from ethnic minority backgrounds experience UB to a greater extent.</p>
<p>A new study published in <em>BMC Health Service Research</em> explores the contributors and drivers of UB in healthcare, to better understand how and why UB develops and how it negatively impacts staff and patient care. A systematic database search with data extracted from 109 reports found that UB can lead to adverse outcomes such as loss of self-worth, burnout, desire to leave the workplace, and even suicidal ideation. Minoritized groups were indeed more severely impacted. Furthermore, UB was linked to distraction, lower confidence, reduced capacity to speak up about errors, and ultimately affecting patient safety and care quality.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that dysfunctional workplace processes, toxic cultures, disempowerment, inhibited social cohesion, and manager unawareness were the main contributors to UBs. Understanding where UBs are arising and improving workplace culture are essential in eliminating UBs and avoiding negative impacts on communication, concentration, and the ability to speak up about errors. Further research is needed to understand why certain demographics (e.g., female staff, minorities, individuals with disabilities) are particularly susceptible to UB.</p>

<p>The use of Nicotine Vaping Products (NVPs) or e-cigarettes are considered a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes and are often used to quit smoking. However, concerns exist, especially regarding their use among young people. NVPs can serve as gateways for those who would not have otherwise smoked or those who previously quit smoking conventional cigarettes and start again because they see NVPs as a healthy alternative. <a href="https://pophealthmetrics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12963-021-00250-7#Sec16">A previously published study</a> introduced the so-called Smoking and Vaping Model (SAVM) &#8211; a tool to assess the potential harm-reducing or harm-increasing effects of NVPs on the American population.</p>
<p>A recent study published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> tested the SAVM on the German population, where the use of NVPs is demonstrably increasing. The authors built the adapted model using three publicly available databases (WHO, United Nations, and GEDA). They compared two different scenarios (No-NVP and NVP) to estimate the public health impact in terms of smoking-attributable deaths (SADs) and smoking-and-vaping-attributable deaths, as well as life years lost (LYLs). Assuming that the excess NVP mortality risk is 5% that of smoking, the model estimated a reduction of 4.7 million LYL and almost 300,000 deaths due to NVP use.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that, since data on tobacco use in Germany may be incomplete and information on the long-term effects of NVPs on public health is lacking, these results should be interpreted with caution. Despite these pitfalls, the SAVM is considered valuable as it was specifically designed to be accessible to non-experts. It will help policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders understand the impact of NVPs on public health and guide tobacco control efforts, especially in countries like Germany, which are currently undergoing changes in tobacco regulations.</p>

<p>On March 12, a senior administrator at a university in India sent a business proposal to a prolific economist in Ethiopia. If he joined the school’s stable of adjunct professors, the administrator promised, easy money could be made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the economist had to do was “add our affiliation for incentives in your papers,” explained <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-lakshmi-t-492295186">Lakshmi Thangavelu</a>, dean of international affairs at <a href="https://www.saveetha.com/aboutus">Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMATS)</a>, in Chennai, in a written exchange.</p>



<p>“Surely I will do that. Not a big deal,” replied <a href="https://et.linkedin.com/in/dr-mohd-asif-shah-04148a93">Mohd Asif Shah</a>, an associate professor at Kebri Dehar University, in eastern Ethiopia.</p>



<p>But the deal turned sour. Although Shah listed SIMATS as an affiliation on at least two <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aess/2023/8891070/">research</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10942912.2023.2254021">papers</a> he published this fall, in December he still hadn’t received any payments from the school, he complained. Then he turned to LinkedIn to share his frustration in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Asif_Shah_Evidence.pdf">post</a> that included screenshots of his conversation with Thangavelu, who is also a professor at Saveetha Dental College, part of SIMATS.</p>



<span id="more-128453"></span>



<p>“Hello Guys,” Shah began, “I am here today exposing one of the biggest scams done by a few higher educational institutions in India.”</p>



<p>According to the post, which has now been deleted, Thangavelu:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>contacts professors across the globe for working as an adjunct faculty for her institution and asks them to publish the research papers for her institution by using the affiliation.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In exchange for this she is promising money by mentioning incentives.</p>



<p>This is all done to get good national and international rankings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">SIMATS’ dental school, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/saveetha-ad.jpg">advertises itself</a> as the world’s most published institution of its kind, has a track record for manipulating publication metrics. A Retraction Watch investigation published earlier this year in <em>Science </em>found Saveetha Dental College had soared to the top of India’s national rankings thanks in part to a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">massive self-citation scheme</a> involving thousands of student papers.</p>



<p>Paying researchers to be added on publications from other institutions may be yet another way the school is gaming the system to get ahead in the rankings. While the extent of the scheme is not clear, according to <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f8a85fc2ad7a514c3fdaf60/t/62909340d9307717906078c9/1653642052592/AQAR+Report+2020-21.pdf">a status report</a> from 2021:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The institution encourages students and faculties to publish their work in high-impact factor journals by providing incentives. The institution has spent Rs. 4.8 crores [about US$ 584.000] as publication incentives.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The tactic is not unique to SIMATS. In 2011, <em>Science</em> described how Saudi universities offered tens of thousands of dollars to highly cited researchers overseas <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.334.6061.1344">to boost their academic standing</a>. Although European institutions have recently <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-11-08/spanish-national-research-council-investigates-five-scientists-for-manipulating-university-rankings.html">pushed back</a> against this practice, scientists in other parts of the world may face less scrutiny and still be attractive targets for universities hungry for publications.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Neither Thangavelu nor SIMATS’ chancellor replied to requests for comment. Shah told us by email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I wanted to bring to your attention that the LinkedIn post/message was inadvertently shared in a public group, it was a private message. I would like to clarify that I do not endorse the content of the statement and do not consent to the use of my message for any publication in any form.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With Shah onboard, SIMATS would have had access to a very productive author. In 2023 alone, Shah published <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;tzom=-60&amp;user=RIa9dpMAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">more than 100 research papers</a> on everything from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35154-z">the fabrication of graphene-based nanocoatings</a> to <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aess/2023/8891070/">predatory arthropods in rice fields</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10942912.2023.2254021">the sensory profile of spiced yogurt</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mohd_Asif_Shah_0000-0002-0351-9559_-_ORCID_-_2023-12-19_17.38.42-cropped.jpg">his ORCID profile</a>, Shah is trained in economics and is an adjunct professor at 10 different universities in Afghanistan, India, Malaysia and Iran, in addition to his position at Kebri Dehar University. SIMATS is not among those institutions because, as Shah wrote on LinkedIn, “as you publish the research papers, you are not paid.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2023/12/21/accessibility-update-arxiv-now-offers-papers-in-html-format/">Accessibility update: arXiv now offers papers in HTML format</a></h4>

              
                <p>arXiv’s goal is equitable access to scientific research for all – and to achieve this, we have been working to make research papers more accessible for arXiv users with disabilities. We are happy to announce that as of Monday, December 18<sup>th</sup>, arXiv is now generating an HTML formatted version of all papers submitted in TeX/LaTeX (as long as papers were submitted on or after December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023 and HTML conversion is successful – more on this below).</p>
<p>HTML is not replacing PDF but will be an additional format available for arXiv users. Submitters will be invited to preview the HTML version of their papers during submission time, the same way they have always done with PDF.</p>
<p>When accessing a paper’s abstract page, readers will see a link to view the HTML paper right under the PDF link:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1530" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper-300x122.png" alt="" width="300" height="122" srcset="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper-300x122.png 300w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2023/12/Access-Paper.png 404w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The request to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from scientists with disabilities who face barriers to accessing the research they need. HTML formatted papers are more easily and accurately read by screen readers and other technologies, which can assist researchers with reading disabilities, including blindness, low vision, dyslexia, and more.</p>
<p>We know that the HTML conversion isn’t perfect yet – right now our HTML is in the “experimental” phase as we work to make conversion more accurate. Currently, not every paper will be able to be correctly converted into HTML. However, researchers with disabilities have told arXiv that HTML is needed *now* for accessibility, and so we wanted to offer that accessibility as quickly as possible, while we continue to work on improving conversions with the help of our community. arXiv will *not* prevent or hold submissions where the HTML conversion has failed, but we do hope that authors will carefully review the HTML version of their submission, as sometimes small changes in the source TeX code can improve the HTML rendering.</p>
<p>Experimental HTML is a big step towards making science accessible to all. We want to thank everyone who collaborated on arXiv’s pilot <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessible_HTML.html">HTML Papers project</a> which includes <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">The LaTeX Project</a>, and the <a href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a> team from NIST. If you are familiar with <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html">ar5iv, an arXivLabs collaboration</a>, our HTML offering is essentially bringing this impactful project fully “in-house”. Our ultimate goal is to backfill arXiv’s entire corpus so that every paper will have an HTML version, but for now this feature is reserved for new papers.</p>
<p>And a big thank you to all the arXiv users who have taken the time to fill out bug reports for arXiv&#8217;s HTML Papers project – our team is currently reading and analyzing the bug reports and hope to make our first round of improvements in the new year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/record-breaking-science-discovery-2023">These scientific discoveries set new records in 2023</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2023, researchers made plenty of discoveries for the record books — and the history books. This year’s scientific superlatives shed new light on our ancient ancestors, our planet and the animals we share it with.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Least sleep among mammals</h4>



<p>However sleep-deprived you may be, you’re probably still better rested than a northern elephant seal. During monthslong hunting trips at sea, these seals nap less than 20 minutes at a time and average just two hours of total sleep per day. That rivals African elephants for the title of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/northern-elephant-seals-sleep-sea">mammal that sleeps the least</a> (<em>SN: 4/20/23</em>).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Earliest equestrians</h4>



<p>The Yamnaya people may have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-worlds-earliest-horseback-riders">the world’s earliest horseback riders</a>, mounting steeds as far back as 3000 B.C., centuries before the earliest known depictions of horseback riding (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 12</em>). Yamnaya skeletons unearthed in Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary show telltale signs of horsemanship, including marks on the femur and pelvis that could come from sitting astride and vertebral damage from falling off.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sunniest place on Earth</h4>



<p>Visitors to the Altiplano plateau in Chile’s Atacama Desert should be sure to pack sunscreen. This high-altitude region gets hit with an average of 308 watts of sunshine per square meter — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-intense-sunlight-earth-atacama-desert">the most intense sunlight anywhere on Earth</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/23, p. 5</em>). Sometimes, solar radiation exceeds 2,000 watts per square meter, rivaling the amount of sunshine expected to beat down on Venus, which is much closer to the sun than Earth is.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Oldest black hole</h4>



<p>A supermassive black hole some 13.2 billion light-years from Earth is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf7c5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most distant, most ancient supermassive black hole</a> ever observed. The monster dates to when the universe was just 470 million years old, making it about 200 million years older than <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/surprising-science-records-superlatives-2021">a record breaker announced in 2021</a> and 100 million years older than a black hole that claimed the title in July (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 29</em>). Because the newfound black hole boasts about the same heft as its surrounding galaxy, researchers think the black hole could have formed only through the collapse of a massive gas cloud. The finding could help shed light on how the universe’s first generation of juggernaut black holes were born.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Snappiest claws</h4>



<p>Famously fast adult snapping shrimp have nothing on their young. High-speed video reveals that youngsters can snap their claws up to about 600 kilometers per second per second — an acceleration 20 times as fast as their elders achieve. A 1-month-old shrimp’s claw acceleration is on the same order of magnitude as a 9-millimeter bullet blasting out of a gun and is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snapping-shrimp-fastest-claw-biology">the highest acceleration for a reusable body part underwater</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/23, p. 5</em>).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Oldest wooden structure</h4>



<p>Despite what happened to the second little pig’s house, wood has long proved a sturdy, reliable construction material — for perhaps as long as half a million years. Carved, interlocking logs uncovered in Zambia date to nearly 480,000 years ago, making them <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/logs-evidence-oldest-wood-structure">the oldest known wooden structure</a> (<em>SN: 9/20/23</em>). The structure — possibly a remnant of a walkway, seating area or storage unit — hints that some human relatives may have led a less nomadic lifestyle than previously thought.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Heaviest animal ever </h4>



<p>The animal kingdom appears to have a new heavyweight champion. An extinct whale aptly named <em>Perucetus colossus</em> might have weighed up to 340 metric tons, about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colossal-ancient-whale-heaviest-animal">twice as much as the heaviest blue whales</a>, an analysis of fossils found in Peru suggests (<em>SN: 9/9/23, p. 5</em>). The mighty mammal is thought to have prowled shallow waters 39 million years ago — but what it could have eaten to maintain its size remains a mystery.</p>

<p><strong>Flipper joins the navy</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ocean-sciences"><em>Science News</em></a>, December 22, 1973</p>



<p>Porpoises, sea lions and even whales have been trained to retrieve dummy rockets and other objects from the bottom of the ocean…. The animals, guided by a homing device, would carry grappling hooks to submerged objects.… But whales became too expensive and kept running off to mate, so research now concentrates on smaller sea mammals such as porpoises.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Today, the U.S. <a href="https://www.niwcpacific.navy.mil/About/Departments/Intelligence-Surveillance-and-Reconnaissance/Marine-Mammal-Program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navy Marine Mammal Program</a>, based in San Diego, trains bottlenosed dolphins and California sea lions to protect ships and harbors. Sea lions help retrieve equipment from the ocean floor, dolphins locate underwater mines and both species detect unauthorized swimmers. Animals in the program have also helped researchers understand dolphin echolocation, assess the impacts of human-generated noise on wildlife and more. Current projects are testing whether it’s possible to <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/152/4_Supplement/A106/2839622/Machine-learning-models-can-predict-bottlenose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judge dolphins’ health based on their whistles</a> and whether a <a href="https://www.navy.mil/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Print.aspx?PortalId=1&amp;ModuleId=2892&amp;Article=3388169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video game system</a> can provide Navy sea lions with cognitive enrichment.</p>
