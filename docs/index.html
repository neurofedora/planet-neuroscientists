                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/AdobeStock_89172846-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Advances in the design and manufacturing of prosthetic devices have emerged at an unprecedented rate in the last few decades. The many innovative solutions, however, face limitations such as the sometimes prohibitive costs incurred during manufacturing and the need for personalised features and bespoke design. 3D printing is now commonly employed in the creation of medical devices and can provide effective solutions to both issues. The implementation of 3D printing comes with its own challenges, including selection of appropriate materials and durability of the product.<br />
The addition of the fourth dimension, time, into 3D printing can bring significant advancements in prosthetics. This state-of-the-art technology, with the capacity to alter the characteristics of prosthetic devices over time, will add tremendous value to the field.<br />

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tear-resistant-rubber-tough-tires">Tear-resistant rubbery materials could pave the way for tougher tires</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new material design could reduce pollution where the rubber meets the road.</p>



<p>Strategically <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding weak points along microscopic chains called polymers</a> actually makes them harder to tear, researchers report in the June 23 <em>Science</em>. Because polymers are used in car tires, the findings could help reduce plastic pollution as tires wear down over time.</p>



<p>When tires scrape against the road, they drop <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/car-tires-and-brake-pads-produce-harmful-microplastics">tiny particles</a> of rubber and plastic polymers, which pollute waterways and contaminate the air (<em>SN: 11/12/18</em>). Every year, tires release an estimated <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/14/10/1265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 million metric tons</a> of these microplastics into the environment. Stronger polymers that break apart less easily could limit the amount of particles shed annually.</p>





<p>To make such tough materials, Stephen Craig, a chemist at Duke University, and colleagues added molecules called cross-linkers to the polymers. These cross-linkers connected jumbled-up polymer chains to their many neighbors, and they were specifically designed to break apart easily. At the microscopic scale, the polymers act like a tangle of spaghetti strands with the cross-linkers holding them all together and helping them retain their shape, says Craig’s collaborator Shu Wang, a chemist at MIT.</p>

<iframe title="A rubbery plastic with weak spots tears slower than with tough ones | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmsznnE92w8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A rubbery plastic polymer with weak cross-linkers, shown on the left, requires more stretching force to tear than a similar polymer with stronger cross-linkers, shown on the right. Adding the weak cross-linkers to rubber could lead to tougher car tires.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the team stretched the polymer spaghetti, the individual cross-linkers broke easily, as expected. But the bulk material required more force to rip than they expected.</p>



<p>The secret to the increased toughness lies in the path the tear has to take, Craig says. The tear propagates through the easy-to-break cross-linkers rather than through the tougher polymer strands. Each broken connection follows the path of least resistance but dodging the long polymer strands means breaking many cross-linkers, which requires more stretching force overall.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time researchers have used weak connectors to make polymers stronger. But unlike in similar materials, the increased toughness doesn’t come at the expense of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1967.0160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other beneficial properties like stiffness</a>.</p>



<p>Craig says he hopes the findings will help extend the lifetimes of car tires and plastics, potentially limiting annual microplastic pollution.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780525657170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fires in the Dark</a><br><em>Kay Redfield Jamison<br>Knopf, $30</em></p>



<p>Mentally and spiritually devastated after surviving World War I’s combat horrors, British poet Siegfried Sassoon was treated for emotional wounds at a military hospital. He wrote a poem for his psychotherapist that included these lines: <br><br><em>Fires in the dark you build; tall quivering flames<br>In the huge midnight forest of the unknown</em></p>



<p>Kay Redfield Jamison takes the title of her new book, <em>Fires in the Dark</em>, from Sassoon’s vivid image of how medical psychologist, physician and anthropologist W.H.R. Rivers tended to his psychological war wounds. Jamison uses writings by both men to explore Sassoon’s therapeutic relationship with Rivers. Their story forms part of a deeper probe into how psychological pain can be healed and what it takes to be a great healer. Jamison writes movingly about topics ranging from the workings of ancient Greek healing temples to the tribulations of World War I nurses facing the limits of healing soldiers’ ravaged bodies and minds.</p>





<p>Jamison, a psychiatrist herself, has previously written about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pushing-mood-swings">her personal experience with bipolar disorder</a>, which informs this literary journey into healing (<em>SN: 4/8/00, p. 232</em>).</p>



<p>Since the dawn of humankind, certain individuals — who combine compelling personalities, a stout character and superior people skills — have stood out as healers of what Jamison has previously described as “unquiet minds.”</p>



<p>Effective healers accompany sufferers on a journey toward wellness, she writes. Healing tools include the deft use of suggestion, confession, memory, ritual and medicines. Healers find ways to provide consolation and hope, enabling their wounded charges to engage with meaningful work and find purpose in life.</p>



<p>That theme reverberates in Jamison’s account of how Rivers treated Sassoon, whose war reactions might today be diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder. As an anthropologist, Rivers had learned about and witnessed healing rituals and supernatural beliefs of different cultures. He had written that “psycho-therapeutics would seem to be the oldest branch of medicine.”</p>



<p>Rivers struck colleagues and those he treated as forceful but caring, demanding but sympathetic. Sassoon wrote that he liked and trusted Rivers within minutes of meeting him. After listening to Sassoon relate his traumatic war experiences, Rivers focused on the soldier’s memory and imagination as key healing elements.</p>



<p>Rivers encouraged Sassoon to use poetry to memorialize friends and soldiers he had commanded but who had not survived. As verses of remembrance and grief accumulated, Sassoon achieved a measure of control over the war’s terror and futility. Feeling a sense of guilt and responsibility for soldiers still fighting, Sassoon returned to the war.</p>



<p>Psychotherapy as practiced by Rivers had roots in the powers of suggestion wielded millennia earlier by priests and sorcerers, Jamison writes. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks, for example, called on priest-physicians who performed early types of surgery, chanted against disease-causing spirits and used magic spells to amplify patients’ responses to medicinal potions.</p>



<p>Jamison includes a fascinating description of ancient Greek healing temples run by followers of Asclepius, the god of medicine. In settings designed to be peaceful refuges, individuals with mental maladies received a special herbal ointment made from imported ingredients. Sufferers were encouraged to enter meditative or hypnotic states and to tell their dreams to temple healers. Dream content guided treatment recommendations.</p>



<p>Therapists today practice a range of purely secular techniques, though they still hark back to the days of Asclepius, Jamison says. Scientifically supported approaches rest on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/questions-couch">a time-tested need for therapists to gain clients’ trust</a> and nurture self-understanding and hope for improvement (<em>SN: 11/5/05, p. 299</em>). That’s truer than ever in an era characterized by the well-funded promotion of medications and brain technologies over mere “talk” as keys to vanquishing mental problems.</p>



<p>As recently as the 20th century, Jamison writes, mental health clinicians emphasized general features of psychotherapy that promote healing. Psychiatrist and psychologist Jerome Frank, for instance, influentially argued in a 1961 book that any successful form of psychotherapy counteracts the demoralization of those who experience the world as chaotic.</p>





<p>Jamison also delves into examples of the healing powers of music, art, drama and public rituals of remembrance. She includes the poignant story of how, thanks to an Anglican army chaplain, remains of the Unknown Warrior came to be buried at Westminster Abbey in 1920 in a ceremony that lessened the postwar grief of people across Britain. Healers often find it difficult to untangle why their efforts sometimes light fires in the dark and other times fizzle out. Jamison’s stories of healing outline a process that’s still emerging from Sassoon’s huge midnight forest of the unknown.</p>

<p>Last month, a millipede expert in Denmark received an email notifying him that one of his publications had been mentioned in <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202306.1339/v1">a new </a>manuscript on <em>Preprints.org</em>. But when the researcher, <a href="https://snm.ku.dk/english/staffsnm/staff/?pure=en/persons/52118">Henrik Enghoff</a>, downloaded the paper, he learned that it cited his work for something off-topic.</p>



<p>Stranger still, the authors of the now-withdrawn preprint, a group of researchers in China and Africa, also referenced two papers by Enghoff that he knew he hadn&#8217;t written. It turned out they didn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had anything like this happen before,&#8221; Enghoff, a professor at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, in Copenhagen, told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-127450"></span>



<p>Flabbergasted, Enghoff reached out to <a href="https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/201051">David Richard Nash</a> at the University of Copenhagen. A few months prior, Nash had been experimenting with <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT</a>, an artificial-intelligence chatbot, to see if it could be used to find scientific literature. He asked the bot to provide him with recent references on the butterfly species he works with. &#8220;It came back with 10 plausible-looking papers,” only one of which existed, Nash told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p>After learning of Enghoff&#8217;s case, Nash emailed <em>Preprints.org</em>, a free preprint server owned by the scientific publisher <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/">MDPI</a>. He explained that he had looked up five random references in the preprint and found that all of them were fictitious. He also hinted that generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT could have been at work, adding:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I suggest that you contact the authors directly and ask for an explanation (and hopefully a retraction and apology to the affected “authors” of these fake references), and also review your policies regarding accepting AI-generated textxs [sic] and references.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In correspondence shared with Retraction Watch, Lloyd Shu, preprints editor at MDPI, apologized for &#8220;the problems caused by this preprint&#8221; and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We will withdraw it immediately and add the authors of this preprint to our blacklist.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neither Shu nor the preprint authors responded to our requests for comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ioana Craciun, scientific officer at MDPI, confirmed that <em>Preprints.org</em> had “taken down a preprint that appears to have been generated using AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.preprints.org/about"><em>Preprints.org</em></a>’s website:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All preprints undergo a short screening before being uploaded online. This process takes less than 24 hours in most cases. Screening includes checks for basic scientific content, author background, and compliance with ethical standards. It is carried out by the Preprints.org staff, with the support of active researchers and the Preprints.org advisory board.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Craciun explained that, because preprints do not undergo peer review, “it may be more likely for AI-generated content to be posted on preprint servers without detection.”</p>



<p>She added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This case serves as a signal for us. It is not only a challenge for Preprints.org, but for all preprint servers, publishers, universities, and the scientific community as a whole. We will review our screening process to identify areas for improvement. While we can pay attention to the extremely low similarity rate of AI-generated content, we cannot rely solely on that. We hope that more powerful tools will be developed to assist in the detection of AI-generated content, and closer inspection of references may be necessary, as demonstrated in this case.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the title of the withdrawn preprint, &#8220;From Beneficial Arthropods to Soil-Dwelling Organisms: A Review on Millipedes,&#8221; is somewhat strange, its abstract appears cogent. (<em>Preprints.org</em> has removed the manuscript, but we have made it available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mawcha-et-al-2023.pdf">here</a>.) The main text is suspicious in places, however, including broken sentences such as these:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Another study by Enghoff [32] carried out on the distribution of millipedes in Southeast Asia, is known to have high levels of species richness and endemism. The distribution and ecology of millipedes and other arthropods, and notes that millipedes are found on all continents except Antarctica [48]. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;If it had gone into a journal, I would definitely be very worried,&#8221; Nash said. &#8220;Going onto a preprint server, I have to admit that slightly confirms some of my prejudice against preprint servers.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Note: The interview with Enghoff was conducted in Danish and translated by the writer, a native speaker.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rats-wind-antennae-whiskers-eyes">Rats sense the wind with antennae-like whiskers above their eyes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many rodents use whiskers to feel their way around their world. But rats appear to take this one step further, using special, antennae-like whiskers above their eyes to sense subtle air movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These long, thin hairs <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may help the rats detect the movements of predators or prey</a> in dark, cramped environments, researchers report July 6 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many studies of rodents have focused on the snout whiskers, says Ann Clemens, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh. But “there are a plethora of whiskers beyond the snout, on other parts of the face and the body.”</p>





<p>While working together on a research course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., Clemens and her colleagues noticed that some of the whiskers above rats’ eyes were particularly long and fine. The researchers wondered if these prominent, exposed hairs, known as supraorbital whiskers, could be used to detect wind.</p>



<p>“Wind is an important carrier of information about the environment in the form of odors, humidity and airflow, but has been barely studied by neuroscience,” says Matias Mugnaini, a neuroscientist at the Leloir Institute in Buenos Aires.</p>



<p>Mugnaini, Clemens and their colleagues compared how all the whiskers on rats’ heads behaved under different wind conditions. Supraorbital whiskers waggle more wildly under light breezes than other whisker types, they found. These light breezes are thought to more closely mimic typical air movement levels in the natural environment than strong winds.</p>



<p>High-powered X-rays showed that where a supraorbital whisker follicle meets a nerve, nerve cell projections are concentrated in a more circular structure than in other whiskers. So these whiskers may be highly sensitive to movement from many different directions, as you might see from the pushing action from wind, the researchers say.</p>

Mugnaini <em>et al</em>/<em>PLOS Biology</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1600716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous research</a> showed that trimming rats’ facial whiskers reduces the rodents’ ability to sense wind. But the new study suggests the whiskers above the eyes in particular are specialized, wind-sensing structures.&nbsp;In total darkness, the rats regularly turned toward where wind was blowing from, but when the team numbed the supraorbital whiskers with lidocaine, the rats turned less frequently.</p>



<p>“Our findings show that not all whiskers on an animal operate in the same way,” Clemens says.</p>



<p>Seals also have supraorbital whiskers that sense underwater flow patterns, Mugnaini says. Rats may use their wind-sensing whiskers to pick up the movements of predators or prey in the dark, the team suggests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It could be that an incoming animal is sensed through a subtle change in airflow,” Clemens says. “The rat would detect this and escape in time or attack their meal.”</p>



<p>It’s possible the whiskers could have multiple functions, says Mehdi Adibi, a neuroscientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the research. The hairs might detect vibrations from sound waves, for example, and could still play an important role helping rats navigate their surroundings using touch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-round-new-measurement-matter-physics">Electrons are extremely round, a new measurement confirms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrons are really, really round.</p>



<p>A new measurement <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg4084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirms the subatomic particle’s spherical shape</a> to a record level of exactness, physicists report in the July 7 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That near-perfect roundness deepens the mystery behind how the universe came to be filled with matter as opposed to its counterpart, antimatter. Any asymmetry in the electron’s shape, namely the distribution of the particle’s electric charge, would point to a related asymmetry in the laws of nature, one that could explain this feature of the cosmos.</p>





<p>The measurement — of a property known in physicist-speak as the electric dipole moment of the electron — is twice as precise as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-shape-round-standard-model-physics">previous best measurement</a> of the electron’s shape (<em>SN: 10/17/18</em>).</p>



<p>“I don’t think Guinness tracks this, but if they did, we’d have a new world record,” says physicist Tanya Roussy of the University of Colorado Boulder. The new measurement is so precise that, if an electron were the size of Earth, any asymmetry in its shape would have to be on a scale smaller than an atom.</p>



<p>To gauge the particle’s shape, Roussy and colleagues looked at whether electrons pivoted in an electric field. If electrons weren’t round but slightly egg-shaped, an electric field would exert a torque on them, much as gravity topples an egg standing on its end.</p>



<p>To see that torque, the team looked for changes in the energy levels of electrically charged molecules of hafnium fluoride. Any torque on the electrons would give the molecules different energy levels depending on which direction the “egg” was oriented relative to an electric field. The researchers found no difference in the molecules’ energy levels, confirming the electron’s roundness.</p>



<p>At their most basic level, electrons are pointlike particles, without a definite size and shape. But in quantum field theory, electrons can be thought of as surrounded by temporary “virtual” particles that pop in and out of existence, giving each electron a spherical halo of electric charge. If that halo were found to be just slightly egg-shaped, that could point to how the universe became lopsided toward matter.</p>



<p>The Big Bang should have created matter and antimatter in equal parts — the two are mirror images of one another, with opposite electric charges. But matter in our universe is common while antimatter is scarce. Theoretical physicists have suggested that the existence of certain subatomic particles could have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">tipped the balance toward matter</a> (<em>SN: 9/22/22</em>). If those particles exist, they would also transiently appear and disappear around the electron, in such a way as to make it oblong.</p>



<p>Such particles would be so massive, and would therefore require so much energy to produce, that they would not be discoverable even at the world’s biggest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva. That makes sensitive studies of the electron’s roundness an important test for particle physicists. And such experiments are poised to improve further, testing for particles of even larger masses, says physicist David DeMille of the University of Chicago, one of the scientists behind the previous best measurement of the electron’s roundness.</p>



<p>For now, the new result shows no trace of any hidden particles, leaving unsolved the mystery of how matter gained the upper hand. And that, DeMille says, “leaves us with the question of what is out there.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-affirmative-action-ban-future">California’s long-standing affirmative action ban hints at what’s to come</a></h4>

              
                <p>Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a half-century of precedent and made it illegal for public and private universities and colleges to consider race in student admissions. The decision comes at a time when the nation is rapidly diversifying, with less than half of children under age 15 identifying as white.</p>



<p>No one can know for sure how the ending of affirmative action will ultimately alter these schools’ racial compositions. But insights from California, which banned race-based admissions at its public universities in the late 1990s, are suggestive.</p>





<p>Immediately following the ban, the percentage of Black, Hispanic and Native American students attending selective colleges in the state plummeted, research shows. With the introduction of race-neutral policies aimed at capturing a similar population of underrepresented students a few years later, those numbers rebounded somewhat, but remain far lower than previous levels.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke with labor economist Zachary Bleemer of Princeton University, who has spent years studying what happened in California. “I think [California’s affirmative action ban] is the closest thing we’ve got to a reasonable sort of microcosm for what is about to happen nationally,” he says.</p>



<p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How has affirmative action influenced the college-admissions process over time?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: Affirmative action has gone through two primary iterations in the United States. From when it started in the late 1960s through the early 2000s, affirmative action was generally a point-based admissions policy that provided an immediate and directed admissions advantage to Black, Hispanic and Native American students.</p>



<p>Imagine that a university has some point-based admissions policy: Take SAT scores plus GPA times a thousand, plus 500 points for extracurriculars, 300 points for leadership activities and 300 points for Black, Hispanic and Native American students. It was just extra points for students from minority backgrounds. It has tended to target Black, Hispanic and Native American students though it has also targeted, at various points, Filipino and other Southeast Asian students.</p>



<p>Then point-based affirmative action policies became unconstitutional in 2003. Since then, race is something that admissions readers pay attention to as they are going through undergraduate applications, providing admissions advantages.</p>



<p>It’s worth emphasizing that in both periods, affirmative action [effects] could be really big. There might have been students with a very similar application. If they were white, they would have almost no chance of getting into a university, whereas if they were Black, they would have been basically guaranteed admission. Some people think of affirmative action as a light-touch policy, but it’s not. It provides very substantial admissions advantages in many cases on the basis of race.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Affirmative action has long generated controversy. Why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: I think there are two primary public criticisms of affirmative action. The first is a question of fairness. People think that it’s unfair to provide admissions advantages based on a born characteristic of young people.</p>





<p>I think it’s primarily for that reason that even in California, a liberal state, when affirmative action was on the ballot in 1996, it lost by 10 points. And when it was back on the ballot in 2020, it lost by 14 points. And it seems to have lost among Hispanic voters, a group that benefits from affirmative action. So this is a deeply publicly unpopular policy.</p>



<p>The second criticism is the concern that affirmative action may not actually benefit the people it’s supposed to benefit. This “mismatch hypothesis” is the idea that, even if you give Black and Hispanic students access to more selective universities, they are going to struggle. They’re not going to be able to compete with their peers in challenging courses. They may have a difficult time getting into selective college majors. They may be more likely to drop out.</p>



<p>As an economist, I was very interested in knowing if this was true on average, whether affirmative action did benefit or even generate costs on average for the Black and Hispanic students it targeted.</p>



<p>The quick and dirty is that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/137/1/115/6360982?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mismatch hypothesis is not true on average</a>. Black and Hispanic students really do derive very substantial advantages from more selective university enrollments. That includes increases in degree attainment, [including] STEM degree attainment, and higher wages through people’s 20s and 30s.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What happened in California after affirmative action ended at its public universities?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: California was this really interesting natural experiment. There were a bunch of kids who wouldn’t typically have been admitted to selective universities who were admitted because of affirmative action. And then there were the kids who abruptly lost access to those universities when the state of California banned affirmative action in 1998. What happened to the kids who turned 18 one year too late to take advantage of the state’s former policies?</p>



<p>In my research, I found three main things. The first is that affirmative action bans lead to this cascade of Black and Hispanic students into less-selective universities, with the largest enrollment declines in the most selective schools. This then leads to long-term negative outcomes for Black and Hispanic students in terms of lower graduation rates and lost wages. The third finding is that this decline in Black and Hispanic students’ outcomes isn’t met by equal gains for the white and Asian students who replace them.</p>



<p>Every time a selective university goes out of its way to admit lower-testing but disadvantaged students [through affirmative action], that low-testing student seems to derive substantially above average gains from access to the school.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Are there race-neutral alternatives to recruiting diverse college students that work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: The most popular of these policies, known as top percent policies, guarantee admission to some number of students coming from the top of every high school in a given state. Top percent policies have been implemented in four states: California, Texas, Florida and Georgia. The original policy in California was the top 4 percent of students. That policy got those students into all the campuses in the University of California system other than UC Berkeley or UCLA.</p>



<p>At really good high schools, the top 4 percent of students could have already gotten into, say, UC Davis or UC Irvine. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272300021X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy doesn’t do very much at those schools</a>. At the lowest-preparation high schools in California — where even the valedictorian would have had a hard time getting into Irvine [or elsewhere] absent this policy — they matter a lot.</p>



<p>These policies tended to increase Black and Hispanic enrollment at UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara, by about 7 or 8 percent. But, for context, affirmative action increased Black and Hispanic enrollment across the University of California system by 20 percent. Affirmative action directly targets students on the basis of race. With top percent policies, many of the top 4 percent students aren’t Black or Hispanic. So a lot of the kids who are pulled into the universities are not on average diversifying those campuses.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Would replacing race-based affirmative action policies with class-based policies help retain student diversity?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: Targeting students on the basis of income has a very small effect on the racial composition of universities. In the same way, race-based affirmative action hardly increases lower income enrollment.</p>



<p>Think about who are the lower income students on the margin of admission to a selective university — the kids who, if you were to give them a bump, would just clear the bar. The low income students with high enough test scores to make it into these selective universities are mostly not Black or Hispanic.</p>



<p>It really depends on what your goal is. If your goal is racial diversity, class-based affirmative action won’t give that to you. But if your goal is class diversity, class-based affirmative action will deliver that.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Another race-based alternative to affirmative action is holistic review. What’s that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bleemer</strong>: Rather than having a point-based scheme that admits all the students with the highest point at some threshold and rejects all the students with the fewest points, holistic review allows a lot more discretion to admissions counselors.</p>



<p>Counselors can contextualize the information, such as giving preference to a student with low test scores from a low-income background. In holistic review, students might be admitted because of their promise, not because of their explicit high level of preparation.</p>



<p>I found that campuses [in California] that implemented holistic review saw Black and Hispanic enrollment increases by 7 percent. Remember, affirmative action increased enrollment by 20 percent, so this is smaller but still meaningful.</p>



<p>Still, if the goal is to increase Black, Native American and Hispanic enrollment, race-based affirmative action is much more impactful than the race-neutral alternatives that universities have implemented as replacements. If your goal is racial diversity, nothing does that as well as explicit race-based targeting.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">Extending Accessible Data to more articles, repositories, and outputs</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz</em></p>



<p>In March 2022, with support from the Wellcome Trust, we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">launched</a> an experimental &ldquo;Accessible Data&rdquo; feature designed to increase research data sharing and reuse. Having observed some interesting preliminary results, we&rsquo;re extending &ndash; and extending the scope of &ndash; our &ldquo;Accessible Data&rdquo; experiment.</p>



<h2>What are we trying to achieve in the next phase of the Accessible Data experiment?</h2>



<p>We began the Accessible Data experiment with two goals, to:</p>



<ul><li>Increase reuse of datasets linked to PLOS articles and</li><li>Increase use of data repositories by offering a visual cue/ reward on articles.</li></ul>



<p>In the next phase of the experiment we have an additional goal: to understand if there are meaningful differences in how readers engage with different types of data, and different types of research output.</p>



<p>To achieve these goals we are increasing the number of articles that will qualify for the icon, by diversifying the repository and output types that are included. In this next phase, articles will display the icon if they:</p>



<ul><li>Were published from 2016 onwards</li><li>Include a link to a research output in a repository in their Data Availability Statement, and</li><li>The link directs to a unique record in <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework (OSF)</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">Gene Expression Omnibus</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">Sequence Read Archive</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/">BioProject</a>, or <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/">Demographic and Health Surveys</a></li></ul>



<p>Extending the icon to articles that link to six additional repositories &ndash; Github, Zenodo, Gene Expression Omnibus, Sequence Read Archive, BioProject, or Demographic and Health Surveys &ndash; achieves two things. First, it increases the number of articles that qualify for the feature three-fold, to more than 15,000 articles, rewarding more researchers and increasing our potential to promote discovery of research data, and code. Second, we&rsquo;re adding different <em>types</em> of repositories, which increases our potential for learning. Dryad, Figshare and OSF, from the first phase, are similar, in so far as they are all generalist data repositories. Gene Expression Omnibus, Sequence Read Archive, BioProject are domain-specific resources commonly used in the Life Sciences, and Demographic and Health Surveys is a key resource in social science and medicine. Domain-focused data repositories tend to have more specific requirements for structure of data and/or metadata, and we want to understand if readers engage differently with domain-specific resources compared to content in generalist repositories.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="284" height="462" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20187" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12.png 284w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12-184x300.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px"></figure></div>



<p>Github is best known for sharing and versioning code and software<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/#asterisk">*</a>, but is often also used for other content, including research data. With <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">rates of code sharing increasing</a>, and code being used or produced in around half of studies reported in PLOS articles, we want to better understand the value of code linked to PLOS articles &ndash; and support a popular resource for sharing research outputs. Indeed, all the newly-added repositories are popular among PLOS authors &ndash; the nine supported repositories collectively are hosting about three quarters of the outputs that PLOS authors share in repositories. They are also compatible with the creation of simple tooling that enables us to create links automatically and in some cases &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;, from accession numbers rather than URLs. See an example <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011387">here</a>.</p>



<p>The results of the next phase of the experiment will inform future strategies to support discovery and reuse of research outputs produced by PLOS authors.</p>



<h2>What have we learned so far?</h2>



<h5><em>Readers are engaging with the Accessible Data icon</em></h5>



<p>In the first 12 months of the experiment (to March 2023) we have recorded more than 20,000 reader clicks on the icon, which displayed on 3,335 articles at initial launch in March 2022, and was automatically added to more than 1,200 more articles published in the 12 months after launch. Through analysis of 543 Figshare datasets linked to PLOS articles, we observed that the average number of views received per month was 2.5 in the 12 months prior to the launch of the feature and 3.0 in the 12 months following the launch (a statistically significant relative increase of 20%).</p>



<h5><em>The icon could influence future data sharing practice</em></h5>



<p>Rates of repository use <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/">are rising among published PLOS authors, 2019-present</a>. But it&rsquo;s not yet possible to measure if the Accessible Data icon has influenced the rate of data sharing in repositories by PLOS authors because the experiment has not been running long enough to measure effects in <em>published</em> papers. However, our <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Dryad_Integration_and_Accessible_Data_surveys/22762469">research</a> suggests that the availability of the icon may help normalize data sharing, and influence which repository researchers select.</p>



<h5><em>Getting the &ldquo;right&rdquo; data links in articles remains a challenge for publishers and authors</em></h5>



<p>The Accessible Data icon rewards sharing data (and code) in a repository via a weblink. Best practice is sharing via a link-able persistent identifier, such as a DOI, but many PLOS articles link to data in other ways, such as via URLs or private links that are intended to be used for peer review only (a common problem for publishers). There is clearly work to do to improve consistency and practice of how data links are shared, but we decided to be inclusive in how we deploy the Accessible Data icon. It displays as long readers can access the data. We decided it was more important to help researchers as authors&nbsp; &ndash; who may be unaware of the nuances of DOIs and private links &ndash; and also help them as readers, by including imperfect but functional links to data in our articles.</p>



<p>We are preparing a fuller report of the qualitative and quantitative insights we&rsquo;ve gained in the experiment in the future. Meanwhile, a summary is available as <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Poster_Testing_new_solutions_to_incentivize_best_practice_in_data_sharing_and_promote_data_reuse/22786454">a poster in Figshare</a>, which was presented at the MetaScience conference &ndash; along with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22762469">supporting data from our surveys</a>.</p>

<p>The co-editors in chief and most editorial board members of the journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ccph20"><em>Critical Public Health</em></a> have resigned their roles to start a new, independent journal, citing differences with their publisher, Taylor &amp; Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While there are inevitable tensions for a critically oriented scholarly journal that is also a commodity marketed by a commercial publisher, over the last year or so it has become increasingly difficult to hold together these two different versions of the journal,” co-editors <a href="https://sociology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/jmgreen/">Judith Green</a> of the University of Exeter in the UK and <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/node/3126">Lindsay McLaren</a> of the University of Calgary in Canada said in a <a href="https://cphn.net/breaking-news/">press release</a> announcing the mass resignation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is simply a relationship that hasn’t worked out and we need to find other ways to continue the spirit of the community,” McLaren told us.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127458"></span>



<p>Earlier this year, the entire editorial boards of the open-access Elsevier journals <em>NeuroImage</em> and <em>NeuroImage: Reports</em> <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/imaging-journal-editors-resign-over-extreme-open-access-fees/">resigned</a> to start a new, non-profit journal after the publisher rebuffed their request to reduce the journals’ fees for authors to publish their work. Editors of another Elsevier journal, <em>Design Studies</em>, have also <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/second-elsevier-journal-board-threatens-mass-resignations">threatened to resign</a> following the publisher replacing the editor-in-chief and pushing the editorial team to publish more papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The press release and <a href="https://cphn.net/2023/07/05/resignation-letter/">resignation letter</a> from the <em>Critical Public Health</em> editors posted online cited a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/09581596.2021.1958512?needAccess=true&amp;role=button">2021 editorial</a> by Green, McLaren, and two other board members discussing the history of the journal and consolidation in the academic publishing industry that led to Taylor &amp; Francis owning the journal. They also cited&nbsp; the publisher “pushing” the editors to move the journal from a hybrid subscription/open-access model to a fully open-access model funded by charging fees to authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors opposed that change. Charging authors to publish their work “risks compounding existing inequalities,” they wrote, and “goes against the entire spirit of the journal,” which was founded to create “a space to challenge public health orthodoxies, shifting the centre and breaking new ground.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the editors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis have made it clear that the choice is ultimately theirs to make, and the Editorial Board’s agreement is not a necessary precondition to changes in how CPH is funded. This move suggests that Taylor &amp; Francis see the journal as a commodity separable from the intellectual community that produces it.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The resignation letter stated that current fees for authors to publish their work as open-access were £2700 per research article (nearly $3,500), which the editors described as:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>an unsustainable cost for research funders and university libraries in high income countries, and an impossible cost for many in less advantaged countries; occasional subsidies do not constitute a viable solution to the much deeper issues of inequity embedded within the profit orientation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter also outlined issues with a new editorial contract and amendment, which “make clear the limited role the publisher sees for the editorial team and board.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In reiterating the rights of the publisher to determine the funding model and volume of articles that will be published, we believe Taylor &amp; Francis have significantly eroded our ability to set strategic direction. The editorial team’s ability to manage a collegial and bespoke response to authors and reviewers has also been systematically undermined by changes (typically without any consultation) to the submission platform, information about the journal, and requirements for manuscripts, and outsourcing key functions such as pre-production.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A Taylor &amp; Francis spokesperson told us the publisher was “disappointed” by the resignations:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>However, we very much look forward to recruiting a new editorial team who share our ambitions for <em>Critical Public Health</em> to extend its relevance and influence for the community it serves. We thank the outgoing board for their dedication to the journal and additionally thank the editors, Judith Green and Lindsay McLaren, for agreeing to stay on in an acting capacity until the current volume has been completed. This will ensure researchers can continue to submit papers as usual and for <em>Critical Public Health</em> to continue its valuable role in areas of public health, health promotion, political economy of health, and related fields.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Critical Public Health</em>’s impact factor in 2022, as well as over the past five years, was 2.8, placing it in the top half for its category.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors who resigned from <em>Critical Public Health</em> have started a new publication, the <a href="https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jcph/"><em>Journal of Critical Public Health</em></a>, hosted by the University of Calgary and owned by the <a href="https://cphn.net/">Critical Public Health Network</a>, a UK-based scholarly organization. An <a href="https://cphn.net/2023/07/05/critical-public-health-editorial-board-resignation-faqs/">FAQ page</a> about the resignations and new journal states that the editors hope to begin publishing content in about a year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-sea-ice-record-low-2023">Antarctic sea ice has been hitting record lows for most of this year</a></h4>

              
                <p>Something strange is happening to the Antarctic’s sea ice. The areal expanse of floating ice fringing the continent is not only at a record low for this time of year — surpassing a record just set in 2022 — but ice extent has been hitting record lows throughout the year.</p>



<p>“What’s happened here is unlike the Arctic sea ice expanse,” says Mark Serreze, a climate scientist and the director of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, or NSIDC, in Boulder, Colo. We’ve come to expect <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">a dramatic decline in sea ice at Earth’s other pole</a>, he says (<em>SN: 9/25/19</em>). “Not much has happened to Antarctica’s sea ice until the last few years. But it’s just plummeted.”</p>





<p>NSIDC uses satellite-gleaned data, collected daily, to <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep an eye on the spread of sea ice</a> at both poles. Throughout most of 2023, the ring of sea ice around Antarctica has repeatedly set new record lows, staying well below the average extent from 1981 to 2010. On February 21 — the height of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer — the sea ice expanse hit an all-time low since record-keeping began in 1978, of 1.79 million square kilometers. That’s 130,000 square kilometers — about the size of the state of New York — smaller than the previous recorded minimum, reached on February 25, 2022.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Subpar sea ice</h3>



<p>The amount of ocean around Antarctica covered in sea ice in 2023 (red) has stayed well below the average from 1981 to 2010 (black). Sea ice expanse hit a record low in late February — surpassing a record set just in 2022 (blue). The sea ice expanse for every year from 1981 to 2021 is shown in gray.</p>

<p>Even as the Southern Hemisphere shifted into winter, Antarctic sea ice remained at record low levels. On June 27, the ice was dotted across about 11.7 million square kilometers of ocean. That’s about 2.6 million square kilometers below the 1981–2010 average, and about 1.2 million square kilometers below the previous lowest extent on record for June 27, set in 2022.</p>



<p>Unlike Arctic ice, whose dwindling is known to be closely tied to global warming, it’s been harder to parse the reasons for changes in Antarctic sea ice extent. That difficulty has made it unclear whether changes are the result of natural variability or whether “something big has changed,” Serreze says.</p>

<p>The last few years<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/battering-storms-caused-antarctic-sea-ice-shrink-record-pace"> have given scientists pause</a> (<em>SN: 6/27/17</em>). “We’re kind of dropping off an edge,” Serreze says. It’s not yet clear whether this year’s extent is part of a larger trend, he notes. But “the longer that persists, the more likely it is that something big is happening.”</p>



<p>The Arctic and the Antarctic regions are polar opposites, so to speak, in their geographic setting. Ice in the Arctic Ocean is confined to a relatively small body of water ringed by land. The Antarctic, by contrast, is a landmass surrounded by ocean, which means the sea ice around the continent is much more mobile than up north, with a larger seasonal range as it expands in the Southern Hemisphere’s winter and shrinks in summer. Climate simulations have, accordingly, consistently predicted that the Arctic would show bigger sea ice losses as the planet warms, at least at first, while Antarctica would be slower to respond.</p>



<p>As to why the Antarctic ice has tracked so low this year there are a few possible culprits. Regional climate patterns — particularly an air pressure pattern known as the Southern Annular Mode that shifts the direction of winds blowing around the continent — can pack or diffuse the sea ice cover around Antarctica. And other regional patterns, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, can affect both ocean and air circulation in the southern high latitudes.</p>





<p>Right now, scientists are concerned most with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">what lies beneath the ice</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). “There’s growing evidence that there has been some kind of change in ocean circulation that is bringing more heat” to the region, which affects the ice cover, Serreze says. “There are a bunch of people looking into this; we’re really blitzing to get the data. We need to understand what the heck is going on in the ocean.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reimagining-animal-behavior-feminist-lens-kamath-packer">These researchers are reimagining animal behavior through a feminist lens</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Ambika Kamath was a graduate student in evolutionary biology at Harvard University, she knew one thing for sure: She wasn’t going to research anoles, the lizards that her adviser, Jonathan Losos, specialized in.</p>



<p>“I started out as one of those rebellious renegades,” Kamath says, determined to pursue her own research subject. So she went to India for a couple of years to study the poorly understood fan-throated lizards. But when she tried to map out their territories, she found chaos. “All of the lizards were moving everywhere,” she says.</p>





<p>Losos encouraged her to work with anoles after all, because it was well established that males hold individual territories that they protect from other males, and females only mate with the male whose territory they reside in. That would make it more straightforward for Kamath to study how anole territoriality differed across habitat types, like forests and parks.</p>



<p>So Kamath went to Florida, where she identified individual anoles and tracked their movements day in, day out. Kamath studied the anoles “in a larger area, in a longer period of time than anyone else had ever done,” says Losos, who is now at Washington University in St. Louis. But instead of revealing territorial differences, this massive dataset showed that the anoles weren’t actually territorial in the first place.</p>



<p>Kamath looked into the historical record to see where the idea of anole territoriality originated. It started with a 1933 paper that described frequent sexual behavior between male lizards in the lab. The authors had concluded that this lab behavior must be “prevented by something” in the wild, Kamath says, which they inferred was the males protecting territories. “The very first conclusion,” she says, “was based on a homophobic response to observing male-male copulation.” That shaky conclusion caught on, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-017-2319-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later researchers assumed it to be true</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing a feminist perspective</h4>



<p>With this work, Kamath had entered the world of scholarship aimed at critically examining science, including interrogations of who is doing research and what biases and viewpoints they bring to their work. In particular, Kamath has adopted <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a feminist approach to science</a>, which critically examines not only how women and gender minorities have been excluded from science, but also how sexist and gendered ideas have influenced the questions scientists ask and how they frame the results of their work — whether they know it or not.</p>



<p>Kamath began to explore how the fact that most of science has been done by white men has shaped our understanding of the world. It’s something biologist Zuleyma Tang-Martínez, widely recognized for her research challenging accepted scientific paradigms, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/027046769201200402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted three decades ago</a>. In 1992, she wrote that incorporating diverse viewpoints and dismantling old ways of thinking can “give rise to a new science that is more humane, and that recognizes the perspectives of women and people of color as valuable.” Still, a lack of diverse viewpoints in science remains an issue today.</p>



<p>Kamath’s research led to a collaboration with another evolutionary biologist, Max Lambert. In 2019 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>, Kamath, Lambert and colleagues critiqued the dominant view of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1019-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how same-sex sexual behavior evolved</a>. Given how common same-sex behavior is in animals, the prevailing hypothesis that exclusive heterosexual behavior is the baseline from which same-sex behavior evolved doesn’t make sense, they proposed.</p>



<p>Instead, sexual behavior likely first evolved to be indiscriminate to all sexes. The focus on explaining how homosexual behavior evolved, Kamath says, is “driven by these heteronormative, if not homophobic, assumptions that are baked into the science.” If we remove those assumptions, she adds, “we&#8217;re going to actually reveal a lot more about biology.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Science is shaped by human bias</h4>



<p>Kamath continues to challenge biological ideas that are rooted in human bias, now at her own lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. Her group focuses on understanding how animals interact with each other and their environments and what drives those interactions, while also examining how human identities and biases shape our perceptions of animal behavior. This concept is reflected in her lab’s name: the <a href="https://kamathlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feminist Lenses for Animal Interaction Research</a>, or FLAIR, Lab.</p>





<p>“Feminist critiques of science have been going on for decades,” says social scientist Melina Packer, who works in the FLAIR lab. The question is why, given that history, so few scientists are ever exposed to social studies that look at science as a human endeavor, complete with human biases. Packer and Kamath are working to change this lack of exposure.</p>



<p>Kamath and Packer first met at the University of California, Berkeley, where Kamath was a postdoc and Packer was a graduate student, in a working group focused on exploring biology through queer and feminist frameworks. While there, Packer teamed up with Lambert, also a member of the working group, to critique the gendered terminology — <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/720131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and thinking</a> — that dominated environmental toxicology, such as the terms “feminize” and “demasculinize” to describe sex-switching in frogs.</p>



<p>Research since the 1990s had focused on chemicals that scientists feared caused frogs to unnaturally switch sex, but Packer and Lambert found that <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA588374803&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=01908286&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E9a899775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this worry was overblown</a>. In fact, frogs switch sex all the time, for all sorts of reasons, and sex changes don’t result in population declines.</p>



<p>As with Kamath’s experience with the anole territories, Packer says, “if you go into an experiment assuming that chemicals are causing sex changes, then you’re going to find it.” What seems unnatural to humans is perfectly normal in frogs. And the emphasis on sex-switching as an outcome of pollutant exposure takes away from studying other impacts that may be more important, Lambert says, like the growth of liver tumors.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Developing a new curriculum</h4>



<p>In the FLAIR Lab, Kamath and Packer are working to perfect a new course in animal behavior that is critical and cross-disciplinary. The course presents radically new ways of thinking about animal behavior, sometimes by first teaching — and then unteaching — dominant paradigms.</p>



<p>For example, Kamath will teach students about Bateman’s principle, which is the idea first presented in 1948 that male animals should be expected to pursue as many mates as possible while female animals should not, because males produce millions of sperm while females produce comparatively few eggs. Tang-Martínez calls this <a href="https://theconversation.com/data-should-smash-the-biological-myth-of-promiscuous-males-and-sexually-coy-females-59665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the biological myth of promiscuous males and sexually coy females</a>. Kamath will then present critiques of the idea, such as modern researchers’ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406825/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inability to replicate Bateman’s findings</a>, as well as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01921.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“theoretical weirdnesses”</a> with how the idea has been used in the decades since it was introduced.</p>



<p>When Kamath teaches the class, some of the students are “baffled” by the feminist critiques of science they encounter in the course curriculum, Kamath says, but she realized that “if we want this more expansive view of doing biology to take root, we’re going to have to face that friction.” She and Packer are also writing a book that builds feminist frameworks for understanding animal behavior, meant for a general audience.</p>



<p>Lambert, now a biologist at the Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife, credits Packer and Kamath with showing him how taking a broader perspective on biology, including interrogating the influence of forces like capitalism and sexism, can lead to more interesting research questions.</p>



<p>Losos says he and Kamath have many differing views, but that’s never gotten in the way of their work. “She has certainly opened my eyes to things that I really never used to think about,” he says.” Kamath created an entirely new statistical framework to quantify how much a lizard’s movements overlapped in time and space with other lizards, which ultimately helped reveal that the anoles she studied aren’t territorial after all. “It was brilliant,” Losos says.</p>



<p>Kamath and Packer are both early-career scientists; redesigning a curriculum and writing popular science books aren’t typical activities among their peers. &nbsp;“I think that’s particularly brave at this career stage,” Lambert says, “to be planting your flag on what you care most about.” And Kamath is still figuring out how to frame her lab’s research on lizard ecology and behavior into a critical, feminist perspective. “I’m not sure that we as a field are there yet,” she says. “The hope was that in the writing of this book, clarity would emerge as to what the next empirical steps would be.”</p>



<p>Both Kamath and Packer recognize the challenges in the work they’re doing, but they also recognize the stakes. Given the recent flurry of homophobic and anti-trans legislation, says Packer, “it doesn&#8217;t help if scientists are reinforcing those same kinds of assumptions,” even unintentionally. Papers that challenge dominate scientific paradigms often struggle to be published, Kamath says. “How much biological discovery are we missing out on?” she asks. “If you have the ability to start changing the conversation, even within scientific communities, it’s an important part of the process.”</p>

<p>A gastroenterology researcher has sued a scientific journal to stop it from publishing an expression of concern for one of her papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/research/office-of-research-and-graduate-education/research-faculty/clinical-and-translational-science/singh-soudamani/">Soudamani Singh</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Clinical and Translational Sciences at Marshall University’s Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine in Huntington, W. Va., is the middle author of “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203552">Cyclooxygenase pathway mediates the inhibition of Na-glutamine co-transporter B0AT1 in rabbit villus cells during chronic intestinal inflammation</a>,” published in <em>PLOS ONE </em>in September 2018. The article has been cited nine times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/07/med-school-vice-dean-says-hes-correcting-paper-amid-negative-misconduct-inquiry/">previously reported</a> that the corresponding author of the paper, <a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/research/office-of-research-and-graduate-education/research-faculty/clinical-and-translational-science/sundaram/">Uma Sundaram</a>, vice dean of research and graduate education at the Edwards School and chair of its department of clinical and translational science, told us he had contacted PLOS to request a correction to the article.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127420"></span>



<p>A <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/08/medical-school-dean-up-to-five-retractions/#comment-2111182">comment</a> on <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2022/06/08/medical-school-dean-up-to-five-retractions">another</a> of our posts had identified a duplicated image in the paper, but Sundaram said he and his coauthors had noticed the “accidental error” independently and notified the journal. The committee that conducted a subsequent research misconduct inquiry into the matter decided not to pursue an investigation because Sundaram had already contacted the journal to make the correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS spokesperson David Knutson told us at the time that the journal had not decided what type of notice to issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Singh’s <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Singh-complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> against PLOS, filed in federal court in April and <a href="https://wvrecord.com/stories/644749864-scientist-seeks-injunction-to-stop-scientific-journal-from-publishing-notice-of-concern">first reported</a> by the <em>West Virginia Record</em>, the journal had decided to publish an expression of concern instead of a correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh is seeking a temporary restraining order and eventually a permanent injunction preventing PLOS from publishing the expression of concern, “compensation for damages incurred as a result of the unlawful and harmful conduct carried out by Defendant,” and recovery of her legal fees. Neither her lawyer nor the local counsel for PLOS has responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/02/25/judge-denies-motion-by-researcher-to-quash-diabetes-expressions-of-concern/">previous case</a> in which a researcher sued to block publication of expressions of concern on his work, a judge denied the request for a restraining order and injunction because, as one legal <a href="https://www.popehat.com/2015/02/26/dr-mario-j-a-saad-tries-and-fails-to-censor-american-diabetes-association/">commentator explained</a>, the law does not allow courts to censor speech ahead of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the lawsuit tells it, the duplicated image was “simply a scrivener’s error” in compiling the manuscript, which the researchers discovered “in or around June 2022,” the month the comment pointing out the duplication appeared on Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the authors notified the publisher of the duplication (which Knutson previously told us happened on June 17), the suit alleges PLOS:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>made numerous inquiries about the Article which were duplicative of the vetting process that Plaintiff had already reviewed with Defendant nearly four (4) years prior – when Defendant’s research editors had accepted the research, data, scientific processes and conclusions related to the Article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nine months later, PLOS notified the scientists of the decision to publish an expression of concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Publishing such a notice instead of a correction is inappropriate, the lawsuit argues, because:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In the research publication world, a Notice of Concern has quite the negative connotation and implies a certain level of intentional misconduct (i.e. plagiarism, falsifying data, etc.) or that something otherwise nefarious has occurred with an article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yet, “there have been zero allegations lodged by Defendants regarding research or publication misconduct,” the suit states. It also cites the findings of the research misconduct inquiry, and quotes a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Marshall-VPR-Sundaram-Letter.pdf">memo</a> from Marshall University’s vice president for research John M. Maher, in which he wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Sundaram and his colleagues did not commit research misconduct, but instead offered exemplary vigilance and diligence in detecting and correcting a mistake in published work.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PLOS’s <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/corrections-expressions-of-concern-and-retractions">guidelines</a> for publishing expressions of concern do not mention misconduct, but state they are “notices published at editors’ discretion to alert readers of serious concerns about published work or an article’s compliance with PLOS policies (e.g. Data Availability).”</p>



<p>Singh’s suit claims that if PLOS publishes the expression of concern, it will damage her reputation and she will lose career opportunities and wages, and it could also “jeopardize a current federal research grant that Plaintiff and her team are applying to renew.”</p>



<p>Besides seeking the temporary restraining order, Singh’s suit alleges breach of contract, negligence, defamation, and unfair and deceptive trade practices, namely that PLOS</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>has engaged in an unlawful and deceptive practice of soliciting articles from authors for publication in furtherance of their own economic benefit, accepting money and later rejecting said articles or, alternatively, engaging in a pattern of falsely publishing unlawful “Notices of Concern.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lawsuit requests a trial by jury.</p>

<p>A better understanding of the neural and functional mechanisms underlying drug-induced
changes in pathological nystagmus is likely to improve medical treatment. A treatment
option for downbeat nystagmus (DBN), a common form of acquired fixation nystagmus that
often occurs with cerebellar degeneration, is low doses of the potassium channel blocker
4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The upward ocular drift in DBN has a spontaneous and a vertical
gaze-evoked component. Detailed analysis of the effect of 4-AP in patients showed that the
drug consistently improved the gaze-evoked component, but had less effect in reducing the
spontaneous drift. We show by a combination of computational modelling at the systems
level and at the neuronal level how this differential effect can be investigated. We have
previously postulated that DBN is caused by damage to the floccular lobe (FL). 4-AP, which
has been shown to increase the excitability of Purkinje cells (PCs) in slice experiments,
may thus suppress DBN by partly restoring floccular function. We simulated the effect of
low concentrations of 4-AP on the cellular level using a multicompartment model of a PC,
in which we changed ion channel properties to simulate damage. The transition from the
cellular level to the systems level was achieved by constructing a population response.
Systems level modelling predicted that the effect of 4-AP on the PCs should reduce DBN,
but the predicted effect on the gaze-dependent component was less than is observed in
patients. Our results suggest that the beneficial effect of 4-AP on DBN cannot be solely
explained by its effect at the neuronal level of PCs, and suggests added effects at the
level of the population of neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-plant-leaves-fibonacci-spirals">A 407-million-year-old plant’s leaves skipped the usual Fibonacci spirals</a></h4>

              
                <p>An unusual arrangement of leaves in a 407-million-year-old fossilized plant is complicating scientists’ understanding of plant evolution.</p>



<p>Most land plants living today have spiral patterns involving the famous Fibonacci sequence of numbers. Because the spirals are so common, scientists have thought that the patterns must have evolved in some of the earliest land plants. But the leaves of the ancient plant, a member of one of the first plant groups known to have developed leaves, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg4014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were arranged in spirals that can’t be described by Fibonacci numbers</a>, researchers report in the June 16 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The study “helps us to understand how [the] diversity of plants has been generated,” says botanist Barbara Ambrose, the director of laboratory research at the New York Botanical Garden in New York City, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two previous ones: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on. Examples of spirals in plants that involve Fibonacci numbers can be seen in the arrangement of the leaves of some succulents, the bracts of a pinecone and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/golden-blossoms-pi-flowers">seeds of a sunflower,</a> among many other plants (<em>SN: 8/27/02</em>).</p>



<p>In plants with spiraling patterns of leaves, all the leaves can be described by a set of curved lines that spiral clockwise out from the center as well as by a set of curved lines that spiral counterclockwise. If the numbers of clockwise and counterclockwise curves are both numbers found in the Fibonacci sequence, it’s known as Fibonacci spiraling.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t sure why most modern plants adopt Fibonacci spiraling, but it might help <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematical-lives-plants-0">maximize the amount of space</a> between leaves or other plant parts (<em>SN: 7/21/07</em>). The patterns could also arise from the distribution of auxins, a type of plant growth hormone.</p>

Hetherington</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the new study, Sandy Hetherington, a paleobotanist at the University of Edinburgh, and colleagues studied fossils of the extinct <em>Asteroxylon mackiei</em>, a member of a group of plants called lycopods that also includes modern club mosses. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The fossils were obtained from the Rhynie chert, a roughly 400-million-year-old deposit of sedimentary rock in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, that contains exceptionally well-preserved fossils of some of the first land plants. In 1969, researchers collected hundreds of cross-sectional images of <em>A. mackiei </em>fossils and the surrounding rock. Hetherington’s team digitally reconstructed the cross sections into 3-D representations of the original plants.</p>



<p>Two of the four reconstructed plants exhibited non-Fibonacci spiraling in their leaf arrangements. Both plants had eight counterclockwise spirals (a Fibonacci number). But one had seven clockwise spirals and the other had nine, neither of which is a Fibonacci number.</p>



<p>The leaves on the other two plants didn’t grow in spirals at all — instead, they grew in a series of rings stacked along the stem.</p>



<p>“Given the prevalence of Fibonacci spirals today and in the later fossil records of plants, we definitely expected Fibonacci spirals,” says study coauthor Holly-Anne Turner, a paleontologist now at University College Cork in Ireland. The <em>A. mackiei</em> fossils predate the next-earliest lycopod fossils that show non-Fibonacci spiraling by almost 50 million years.</p>





<p>Lycopod leaves evolved separately from leaves in other types of plants, but some modern lycopods do exhibit Fibonacci spiraling. That suggests the spiraling patterns may have evolved separately in different lineages of plants, says Peter Crane, a botanist and president of the Oak Spring Garden Foundation in Upperville, Va., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p><em>A. mackiei</em> is just one species, Ambrose notes. Though the fossil record is patchy, reconstructing other early plants could offer more clues to how these spirals evolve in nature.</p>



<p>New computing technology also means that it’s worth revisiting fossils that had been analyzed by hand decades ago, Turner says. With the amount of information and detail that can be collected from computer simulations, “you could find something really great.”</p>

<p>A pharmacy researcher who left the University of Pennsylvania sometime last year has been found guilty of research misconduct in multiple federal grant applications and five published papers, four of which have already been retracted.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/25/penn-maintains-wall-of-silence-over-now-retired-prof-as-retractions-mount/">we have reported</a>, William Armstead, who is retired from Penn, was working among other things on the effects of brain injury on piglets – experiments in which the animals were slaughtered. He has had <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dArmstead%252c%2bWilliam%2bM">seven papers retracted</a>, and <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/penn-scientist-william-armstead-investigation-retracted-piglets-20220906.html">reported in September</a> that he had left the university. Penn <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/25/penn-maintains-wall-of-silence-over-now-retired-prof-as-retractions-mount/">did not respond to several requests</a> for comment when we attempted to reach officials there about Armstead’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-armstead-william-m">U.S. Office of Research Integrity</a>, much of that work appears to have been suspect:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127442"></span>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-mosquito-possum-flesh-eating-disease">In Australia, mosquitoes and possums may spread a flesh-eating disease</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>HOUSTON </strong>— Some mosquitoes buzzing around parts of Australia could be ferrying dangerous cargo from possums to people: flesh-eating bacteria.</p>



<p><em>Mycobacterium ulcerans </em>is the microbe behind Buruli ulcer, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/africas-latest-scourge">disfiguring skin disease</a> that largely occurs across areas of Australia and Africa (<em>SN: 7/17/99</em>). Antibiotics can help ulcers heal completely, but untreated cases can cause scarring, permanent disfigurement and disability.</p>



<p>Humans aren’t the only creatures that can get the disease. In Australia, the country’s native possums — including the common ringtail (<em>Pseudocheirus peregrinus</em>) — do too, developing ulcers and shedding the bacteria in poop. The possums are thought to transmit the bacteria to people, and researchers have suspected mosquitoes interacting somehow with infected possums could play a role.</p>





<p>Figuring out exactly what animals may harbor the bacteria and how they come into contact with people could help with efforts to control the disease. But a link between the possums, mosquitoes and people hadn’t been found.</p>



<p>Now, surveys of mosquitoes in southeastern Australia have provided that link. Analyses of captured mosquitoes show that a small number of the insects <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10789/presentation/3516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had recently fed on both possums and people</a>, molecular microbiologist Timothy Stinear reported June 18 at the ASM Microbe 2023 meeting.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses also revealed that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.07.539718v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>M. ulcerans</em> bacteria from mosquitoes, possums and people are identical</a>, Stinear and colleagues reported May 7 at bioRxiv.org in a preliminary study that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. The finding that the microbes have indistinguishable DNA in all three “really [ties] up that transmission chain between all of these species,” said Stinear, of the University of Melbourne in Australia.</p>



<p>The research provides “pretty compelling” evidence that mosquitoes could be transmitting the disease in Australia, says Jennifer Guthrie, a microbiologist and epidemiologist at Western University in London, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>



<p><em>M. ulcerans</em> is a slow-growing microbe. It can take from two to nine months before people develop symptoms of the flesh-eating disease. “Pinpointing transmission of something that happened months and months ago is really challenging,” Guthrie says.</p>



<p>In their research, Stinear and colleagues captured more than 72,000 mosquitoes from the Mornington Peninsula, a part of southeastern Melbourne where the disease is found. When the team tested about 18,000 individuals for <em>M. ulcerans</em>, nearly all that tested positive belonged to one species of day-biting mosquito: <em>Aedes notoscriptus</em>.</p>



<p>Of 13 mosquitoes from that species that had recently fed on an animal, two had sucked blood from both a ringtail possum and a person. That’s a small number, but such mosquitoes are probably rare, given that only about 200 to 300 cases of Buruli ulcer are reported in Australia each year, though cases are on the rise. In 2022, around 2,100 Buruli ulcer cases from 11 countries were reported to the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>The team also found overlap among the areas where infected mosquitoes hang out, where researchers find possum poop contaminated with the bacteria and where there are diagnosed Buruli ulcer cases in people. But it’s still unclear how exactly the mosquitoes may carry <em>M. ulcerans</em> from animal to person.</p>



<p>It’s possible that <em>A. notoscriptus </em>feeding on possum ulcers could physically bring microbes along for the ride to their next victim. But other mosquito species analyzed by the researchers also feed on possums yet don’t seem to pick the bacteria up. Another idea is that possums’ poop sometimes ends up in the small artificial containers where <em>A. notoscriptus</em> likes to lay its eggs, contaminating the water and infecting the growing insects.</p>



<p>The transmission of the disease in Australia appears to be distinct from what occurs in Africa. In western Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/still-waters-skin-disease-microbe-tracked-ponds-swamps">water bug</a> bites can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212553114000089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inject the bacteria into skin</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/08</em>). Whether the bugs transmit the microbes to people from another animal is unknown.</p>





<p><em>M. ulcerans</em> from each continent are so genetically similar that it’d be surprising if the transmission cycle were incredibly different, Stinear said. But, so far, surveys in western Africa of other animals including mosquitoes and small mammals have yet to turn up signs of <em>M. ulcerans</em>. It’s possible, he said, “we’re missing something in our studies in Africa.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dust-snow-melt-great-salt-lake-utah-shrinking">Dust from a shrinking Great Salt Lake may be accelerating Utah’s snowmelt</a></h4>

              
                <p>Utah’s trademarked “greatest snow on earth” may be getting dirtier — and melting faster — due in part to dust blowing off newly exposed lakebed from the shrinking Great Salt Lake.</p>



<p>Snow in the Wasatch Mountains above Salt Lake City had <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acd409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more dust deposited on it in 2022</a> than in any year since observations began in 2009, researchers report in the June <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>. The dust accumulation caused snow to disappear 17 days earlier than if the snow had been clean.</p>





<p>An earlier, faster snowmelt may alter the water supply for the 1.2 million people who live in the region, as well as ecosystems downstream, says McKenzie Skiles, a snow hydrologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. It also affects the region’s ski areas, which contribute more than $1.5 billion per year to the local economy.</p>



<p>In arid parts of the western United States, snow acts as a natural reservoir. More than half the municipal water in Salt Lake City comes from four streams that drain snow out of the Wasatch Mountains. But current forecasting tools don&#8217;t account for the impact of dust, Skiles says, which absorbs sunlight, speeding up snowmelt. That means people can’t accurately predict when snow runoff will happen so they can use water efficiently.</p>



<p>As an avid skier, Skiles noticed the slopes near Salt Lake City looked especially dirty in 2022. So she and colleagues investigated whether the increase in dust was related to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-salt-lake-shrinking-utah-drought">consecutive years of record-low water in the Great Salt Lake</a> (<em>SN: 4/17/23</em>).</p>



<p>The team collected snow samples from a plot adjacent to Alta Ski Resort and found that storms deposited substantial amounts of dust 16 times during the 2022 snowmelt season. After calculating where the dust came from during each storm based on wind direction and atmospheric conditions, the team found that Great Salt Lake contributed nearly a quarter of the total dust to the study site. It also released the most dust relative to the lake’s exposed surface area. This was surprising, Skiles says, because the Great Salt Lake&#8217;s dry lakebed is tiny compared with the exposed surfaces of neighboring dust sources, such as the much bigger West Desert, a dry landscape west of Great Salt Lake. The West Desert contributed about of half the dust, while other dried-up lakebeds and deserts, some as far away as Idaho and Nevada, delivered the rest.</p>

<p>“The future of Utah is going to be drier,” says Patrick Belmont, a hydrologist at Utah State University in Logan who was not part of the study. Earlier snowmelt causes the landscape to dry out faster, creating “a feedback loop that’s hard to break out of,” he explains. As Great Salt Lake shrinks and deposits more dust on the mountains, there’s less water available to refill the lake during the summer, which in turn exposes a larger dust source as the shoreline recedes.</p>



<p>A smaller lake also means less winter snow, Belmont says, as evaporation from Great Salt Lake contributes up to 10 percent of the snowpack in the Wasatch range. “Unless we make some big policy changes, we should expect to see a much lower Great Salt Lake, and it&#8217;s very possible that we lose the lake altogether.”</p>



<p>Skiles and her colleagues plan to keep monitoring the snowpack and to use remote sensing to see if dust is impacting snow across all of the mountains that drain into the Great Salt Lake. “We need more years of data to understand if this is the new normal,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asia-xiongnu-nomadic-empire-expansion">How Asia’s first nomadic empire broke the rules of imperial expansion</a></h4>

              
                <p>In an age that spawned the ancient Roman and Egyptian empires, Mongolia’s Xiongnu Empire broke the rules of imperial expansion.</p>



<p>Long before the Mongol Empire arose, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-western-man-found-ancient-mongolian-tomb">Asia’s first nomadic empire, horse-riding Xiongnu people</a>, conquered ethnic groups across the continent’s northeastern and central expanses (<em>SN: 1/29/10</em>). A common political system headed by Xiongnu imperial rulers formed about 209 B.C. and lasted for roughly 300 years. Unlike in Rome or Egypt, mobile groups of Xiongnu animal herders accomplished this feat without building cities, forming central bureaucracies, devising a writing system or mobilizing masses of farmers to produce food.</p>



<p>Today, remnants of Xiongnu culture largely consist of more than 7,000 tombs, some heavily looted and many yet to be excavated, in Mongolia and nearby parts of China and Russia. In the last decade, geneticists and archaeologists have ramped up efforts to study these sites and ancient records to decipher the Xiongnu Empire’s political organization and technological achievements.</p>

<p>A few ancient Chinese chronicles include descriptions of the Xiongnu political system. These accounts portray the Xiongnu as predatory raiders who belonged to a “simple” confederation of herding groups run by a few nomadic alpha males. Even so, warfare with mounted Xiongnu warriors equipped with bows, arrows and metal weapons had inspired Imperial Chinese leaders to construct their Great Wall.</p>



<p>Some researchers have argued that Xiongnu people formed a lesser, “shadow empire” alongside Imperial China. But that view is giving way to a picture of the Xiongnu Empire as a different, not lesser, type of ancient state, says Yale University archaeologist William Honeychurch.</p>





<p>In this view, nomadic Xiongnu elites developed a flexible system of political power that connected mobile groups with different genetic and cultural ancestries spread across extensive grasslands and forests. “Elite lineages were not only an important part of a multiethnic Xiongnu state, but members of these lineages were sent to peripheral areas as part of state integration,” Honeychurch says. One new study, for example, indicates that Xiongnu women from elite lineages in central Mongolia served as “princess” emissaries to the empire’s frontier, assuming political power in distant territories populated by various ethnic groups.</p>



<p>“This must have been an empire organized around moving populations,” says archaeologist Bryan Miller of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “Xiongnu elites were savvy politicians who delegated power to keep the empire together.”</p>



<p>In another recent development, excavations in Central Mongolia point to Xiongnu people as early ironworking innovators whose advances spread to their regional neighbors. These discoveries, and others, highlight the unappreciated complexity and the ongoing mystery of how Xiongnu society worked, researchers say.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Xiongnu dispatched frontier ‘princesses’</h4>



<p>Initial insights into the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xiongnu people’s diverse genetic origins</a> were first published in 2020. DNA extracted from remains of 60 individuals excavated at 27 Xiongnu sites indicated that two genetically distinct populations of Mongolian herders had coalesced to become the Xiongnu people around 2,200 years ago. One population descended from several western Mongolian cultures and the other from a couple of eastern Mongolian cultures.</p>



<p>Additional genetic contributions to the Xiongnu mix then came from farther away, most likely a culture near present-day Ukraine as well as Imperial China, reported archaeogeneticist Choongwon Jeong of Seoul National University in South Korea and colleagues.</p>



<p>Building on those findings, Jeong’s team then examined DNA of 17 individuals from elite and low-status graves at two Mongolian cemeteries on the Xiongnu Empire’s western frontier. Central Mongolia’s Xiongnu heartland lay around 1,200 kilometers to the east.</p>



<p>The six largest and richest tombs contained <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf3904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women whose genetic ancestry traced back to central Mongolia</a>, the scientists reported in April in <em>Science Advances</em>. These women rested in wooden coffins placed in square tombs. Items found in these tombs included gold sun and moon emblems of Xiongnu imperial power, glass beads, silk clothes and Chinese mirrors.</p>

Bayarsaikhan</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>One woman was buried with horse-riding equipment, a gilded iron belt clasp and a Chinese lacquer cup. These objects have previously been found in graves of male horse-mounted warriors. But such items signal that a deceased person had been powerful, not necessarily a warrior, says Miller, a study coauthor.</p>



<p>Miller and his colleagues suggest that the women had been sent to the frontier to maintain Xiongnu traditions and nurture <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-nomadic-herders-beat-path-silk-road">contacts with Silk Road trade networks</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/17</em>). Preliminary signs of genetic relatedness among individuals interred at one of the cemeteries suggest that some elite Xiongnu “princesses” also cemented power by marrying into local families.</p>





<p>The elite women’s graves were flanked by simple graves of adult men, and of girls and boys ranging from babies to adolescents. These commoners possessed greater genetic diversity than the female big shots. If the men were retainers or servants of female elites, they had come from distant parts of the Xiongnu Empire or possibly beyond, the researchers say.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Male rulers were homebody ‘princes’</h4>



<p>Like these female elites, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ara.2023.100446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">premier Xiongnu rulers had common roots in central Mongolia while their followers had diverse geographic origins</a>, another team reports in the June <em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>. But rather than being sent to the far reaches of the empire, these rulers stayed close to home.</p>



<p>Three male nobles interred in large underground tombs at one of the largest Xiongnu cemeteries, Gol Mod 2, spent most or possibly all their lives in the Khanuy Valley where they were buried, say archaeologist Ligang Zhou of Henan Provincial Institute of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology in Zhengzhou, China and colleagues.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, at least four of eight individuals buried in some of the many small satellite graves situated near the nobles’ tombs had spent much of their lives in distant places before settling in or near the Khanuy Valley, measurements of different forms of the element strontium in individuals’ teeth and bones indicate. Diet-related strontium signatures, which vary from one region to another, signal where a person spent early and later parts of their lives.</p>



<p>The identities of those in satellite graves, who were apparently killed to form entourages of followers that accompanied deceased nobles, are unclear. They include children and adults, Zhou says. Some were buried with metal weapons or luxury objects such as jewelry.</p>



<p>Genetic and strontium findings suggest that “Xiongnu political organization in central and western Mongolia was highly similar,” Zhou says. Then, as the empire expanded, rulers in the Xiongnu heartland sent select members of their extended families, such as high-ranking women, to new territories in order to replicate the imperial power structure.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Iron innovations bolstered the Xiongnu Empire</h4>



<p>From the start, Xiongnu imperial power depended on a ready supply of iron weapons and other gear that enabled horse-mounted warfare. Researchers who view the Xiongnu Empire as a faint version of &nbsp;Imperial China argue that the nomads’ power depended on importing crops and borrowing iron-making techniques, or simply trading for iron products, from the Chinese.</p>



<p>But new findings suggest that Central Mongolian metallurgists launched a regional boom in iron production around the time the Xiongnu Empire originated, says archaeologist Ursula Brosseder of the University of Bonn in Germany.</p>



<p>At a riverbank site, Brosseder and colleagues have excavated five iron smelting installations that contain by-products of iron making and burned wood. Radiocarbon dates of that material extend to as early as around 2,200 years ago, when the Xiongnu Empire arose.</p>



<p>That makes these finds, each of which consists of two pits connected by a tunnel, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41826-023-00066-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the oldest Xiongnu iron smelting kilns</a> by at least 100 years, the researchers reported in March in <em>Asian Archaeology</em>.</p>



<p>Earlier research had established that people living just north of Xiongnu territory in southern Siberia started producing iron as early as around 2,800 years ago. Based on comparisons of finds in the two regions, Xiongnu metallurgists not only learned about iron making from their neighbors but also invented tunnel furnaces, the investigators say. Eastern Asian groups outside the Xiongnu sphere began making and using tunnel furnaces over the next couple of centuries.</p>



<p>Discoveries by Brosseder’s group “show that metallurgy reached the Xiongnu in Mongolia from southern Siberia, not China,” says archaeologist Nikolay Kradin, director of the Institute of History, Archaeology and Ethnology at the Far-Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Vladivostok. Craftspeople at several iron-making centers, some slightly younger than Brosseder’s discoveries and others yet to be found, must have managed that technological transition, hypothesizes Kradin, who did not participate in the new research.</p>



<p>Brosseder suspects the Mongolian site she’s studied hosted a major iron-making operation. Four iron-making furnaces excavated near the other five have not yet been dated. And ground-based remote sensing equipment has revealed signs of at least 15, and possibly 26, more iron smelting kilns still covered by sediment.</p>



<p>“We can expect more findings of Xiongnu iron smelting centers considering the demand for iron horse gear, arrowheads, carts and other material by the empire’s large army,” Brosseder says.</p>



<p>No reliable estimates exist for the size of that army, or for the overall number of Xiongnu people, says Michigan’s Miller. Xiongnu herders, who also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60194-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occasionally cultivated a grain called millet</a>, moved across the landscape in relatively small groups that must have been greatly outnumbered by <a href="http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1950_population.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imperial China’s estimated 60 million citizens</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The capital was a seasonal seat of power</h4>



<p>In the same valley where Brosseder’s group discovered the oldest known Xiongnu iron smelting kilns, Mongolian researchers have uncovered remains of what was probably <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/18/c_139222374.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Xiongnu political center, or perhaps even its capital, called Longcheng</a> in 2020. Consistent with everything else about the Xiongnu Empire, “this was a capital of a different kind,” says&nbsp; Miller.</p>



<p>Longcheng excavations so far have focused on a large building that may have hosted important gatherings.</p>



<p>Roof tiles on that structure bear an inscription in ancient Chinese characters that reads “Son of Heaven Chanyu.” Chinese records refer to the supreme Xiongnu ruler as “chanyu.” That royal inscription, the only one found within the Xiongnu realm, identifies Longcheng as a seat of power, Miller says.</p>



<p>Rather than a permanent site, Longcheng, like several <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">excavated Xiongnu villages and walled compounds</a> in central Mongolia, served as a seasonal stopover or temporary meeting place, Miller suspects (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>). “We don’t know if those other sites were separate political capitals for the Xiongnu,” he says. Top Xiongnu honchos gathered for part of the year at Longcheng before packing up and moving elsewhere, he speculates. Xiongnu herders, regardless of political status, navigated animals to seasonal grazing spots. Staying in one place throughout the year was not an option.</p>



<p>Having a flexible, mobile system of rule appears to have kept the nomadic realm rolling for a few hundred years before the Xiongnu Empire rapidly disintegrated about 1,900 years ago. Why it did so is an enduring mystery. Perhaps the empire succumbed to combined attacks by Imperial China and other groups or, in true nomadic fashion, Xiongnu people reorganized on a smaller scale and moved to safer areas.</p>



<p>Still, “the Xiongnu had created a massive imperial network in Asia,” Miller says. “Their ways of life didn’t go away overnight.” For instance, Xiongnu-mediated trading by groups situated along Central Asia’s Silk Road routes continued despite military defeats in the empire’s central Mongolian heartland. Only further archaeological and genetic discoveries can clarify how Xiongnu people in the imperial core responded to those setbacks.</p>



<p>Whatever happened, Asia’s first nomadic empire can likely be counted on for a few more surprises.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-mosquito-united-states">Four things to know about malaria cases in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time in 20 years, five people have picked up malaria on U.S. soil.</p>



<p>On June 26, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory, announcing that over the last two months <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00494.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four people in Sarasota County, Fla, and one person in Cameron County, Texas</a>, had developed the mosquito-borne illness. The new cases mark the first time since 2003 that U.S. residents have contracted malaria after being bitten by a mosquito close to home. All five people received treatment and are improving.</p>





<p>Malaria, which is caused by <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites and spread to humans by <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes, is not unheard of in the United States. The disease was once prevalent before widespread spraying of the insecticide DDT helped to purge the country of any parasite-infected mosquitoes. By 1951, malaria had been eliminated within U.S. borders.</p>



<p>But the disease still circulates in many countries around the world. Globally, there are more than 200 million cases of malaria each year and hundreds of thousands of deaths, most of which happen in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. In October 2021, the agency approved <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-science-stories-updates-mosquitoes-malaria-tulsa-wildfires">a malaria vaccine for children living in sub-Saharan Africa</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/21</em>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic stifled travel, about 2,000 cases were diagnosed across the United States each year. Such cases were exclusively in people who traveled abroad to parts of the world where the disease is common and returned home with parasites in tow. But none of the five people in Texas and Florida had traveled, meaning they’d contracted the disease from local mosquitoes.</p>



<p>The risk of local transmission in the United States “remains extremely low,” the CDC noted in the health advisory. But the <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes, vectors capable of spreading the parasite from person to person, are found around the country, a grim reminder that malaria can still pose a threat. &nbsp;</p>



<p>People tend to think of malaria as a tropical disease, says Christopher Vitek, a medical entomologist at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Edinburg. “But the fact of the matter is, historically we’ve had a fair amount of malaria transmission here in the U.S.” And the risk of transmission now is not zero. Officials in Texas and Florida are keeping an eye out for more cases.</p>



<p>Here are four things to know about malaria and the latest cases.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Local transmission in the United States is rare, but not worrisome</h4>



<p>At the moment, experts aren’t highly concerned about the five new cases. “We’ve gotten really good at understanding transmission,” says Johanna Daily, a parasitologist and infectious diseases physician at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. “And we’re very good at vector control, which is really going to be the win here.”</p>



<p>Spraying insecticide around homes and areas where mosquitoes breed can help bring the insects’ numbers down. Window screens keep the insects out of homes, and mosquito repellents or clothing treated with the insecticide permethrin can prevent bites. Getting rid of standing water can stop mosquitoes from multiplying. These tactics helped end a 2003 outbreak — when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5319a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight people in Palm Beach County, Fla.,</a> were infected by local mosquitoes — as well as 62 other outbreaks since 1957.</p>



<p>Because malaria is still a huge problem in many places, outbreaks in the United States, while rare, also aren’t unexpected. For this latest one, “it would be more surprising to me if it was far more cases or spread out across a lot of counties,” says Sadie Ryan, a medical geographer at the University of Florida in Gainesville.</p>



<p>One small plus is that the parasite behind the current outbreak is <em>Plasmodium vivax</em>, which is not the cause of the worst type of malaria. That title belongs to <em>P. falciparum</em>, the most common and deadliest of five species known to infect people. While some <em>P. vivax</em> infections are still fatal, it’s far less deadly, Daily says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="449" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/063023_EG_malaria_inline-1.jpg" alt="An image of red blood cells with dark spots in the middle on a white background." class="wp-image-3129375" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/063023_EG_malaria_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/063023_EG_malaria_inline-1-580x383.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/063023_EG_malaria_inline-1-282x186.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129375"><em>Plasmodium vivax</em>, seen as dark spots inside red blood cells, is one of five parasite species that can cause malaria in people. While less severe than the most common type of parasite, <em>P. vivax</em> infections can still be deadly.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129375">Ed Reschke/stone/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new cases will likely make health care workers hypervigilant, Daily says. But <em>P. vivax </em>can lie dormant inside the liver for weeks, months or years after the infection. “I do worry that as months go by and we forget about locally acquired malaria” that some people might go undiagnosed and spark new outbreaks.</p>



<p>It may seem odd that cases appeared in two separate states around the same time, but there’s no evidence to suggest that the cases are related, according to the CDC.</p>





<p>Certain events in other parts of the world — such as a spike in cases in a spot with lots of travel — can make it more likely that malaria might pop up in the United States, Vitek says. Increased travel to places where there are ongoing outbreaks can raise the chances a person or mosquito with malaria will arrive on U.S. soil.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Malaria can be hard to identify by its early symptoms</h4>



<p>People with malaria typically develop fever and flulike symptoms including chills, body aches, headache and tiredness. These symptoms are also typical of other diseases like mosquito-borne dengue fever, Daily says, which can make malaria hard to pick up if health care workers aren’t already considering it among the list of possibilities.</p>



<p>“You cannot clinically distinguish dengue from malaria from the flu from other things,” she says.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Treatments are available, but if left untreated, malaria infections can become severe and cause seizures, coma and death.</p>



<p>There are some hallmarks, such as anemia, jaundice and fevers that come and go. <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites infect and reproduce inside red blood cells and liver cells, which burst and release offspring into the blood stream. Some people develop anemia or jaundice as infected cells die. And when the body detects these foreign invaders, it can spark a fever. As young parasites hide inside new cells, the alarm bells quiet and the fever fades. With <em>P. vivax</em>, such cyclic fevers might appear every 48 hours or so.</p>



<p>But sometimes a fever’s timing isn’t textbook, which can throw off health care workers, Daily says. So, it’s important for people involved in patient care to keep malaria in mind when considering the possibilities. “We never think about malaria unless it’s a traveler who comes, has a fever, has nonspecific symptoms and says ‘Well, I just got off a plane.’”</p>



<p>Now, health care workers working in and nearby the affected Florida and Texas counties need to consider malaria as a cause of illness. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Infected travelers and mosquitoes can transport malaria across borders &nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>It remains unclear why the five people got infected without traveling. But there are two ways for malaria to return to places where it has been eliminated, Vitek says. Either infected travelers transport the parasite across borders, or infected mosquitoes do.</p>



<p>In the first scenario, a traveler might return home with malaria and just so happen to get bitten by an <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito. Around nine to 18 days later, after any parasites have multiplied inside the mosquito, the insect can transmit malaria to the next person it bites.</p>



<p>There are many <em>Anopheles </em>species capable of transmitting malaria, such as <em>Anopheles freeborni</em>, the western malaria mosquito, across the United States. Florida, for instance, hosts 14 different species. Two of those, <em>A. quadrimaculatus </em>and <em>A. crucians</em>, are responsible for most past cases. These insects are twilight biters that love to hang out in vegetation around swamps, Ryan says. Fortunately, not many people tend to go to these spots during Florida summers when mosquitoes are rampant.</p>



<p>But if a traveler with malaria happens to venture out and get bitten by <em>A. crucians</em>, that insect could become an unwitting vector of disease.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Infected mosquitoes can also travel by land, air or sea — often by hitching a ride alongside people — and transport <em>Plasmodium</em> from place to place. “Airport malaria,” for example, can happen when the insects travel by plane and infect people who live nearby, Daily says. But <em>Anopheles </em>mosquitoes don’t travel very far, so such cases would typically pop up a mile or so away from airports.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mapping malaria</h3>



<p>While many countries around the world, including the United States, have eliminated malaria and have no known transmission, the disease is still a major problem. Most cases and deaths happen in Africa, where the deadliest and most common malaria parasite, <em>Plasmodium falciparum,</em> is common. Other regions have transmission in only some places.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Warming temperatures and travel can help mosquito ranges spread</h4>



<p>Climate change is expected to expand the range of many insect-borne diseases, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nepal-reeling-from-unprecedented-dengue-virus-outbreak">including dengue</a> and <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04531-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malaria</a> (<em>SN: 10/7/19</em>). But whether it’s the reason malaria is circulating in the United States for the first time in decades is unclear. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Independent of warming temperatures, Texas and Florida already “are in a very suitable part of the world for malaria,” Ryan says. While mosquito control pushed the disease out, such places aren’t going to stop being fitting spots for malaria transmission. “The possibility of introduction is always here.”</p>



<p>As the climate warms, however, the mosquitoes’ livable range could extend farther north, both Ryan and Vitek say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, an invasive, malaria-spreading mosquito that has an affinity for biting people is also on the move.</p>



<p><em>Anopheles stephensi</em> thrives not in swamps or rural areas far from people, but in artificial containers in urban areas across India and the Middle East, Ryan says. Now, “it has left its original range, and it’s setting up shop across different countries in Africa.” If the species were to also spread to the United States, its tendency to bite people and live in urban areas could make it a riskier vector than current species to spread malaria among people. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts have the tools to deal with these urban mosquitoes because <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, the species that spreads dengue and Zika, also thrives close to people, Ryan says. Still, “it just definitely makes me nervous that we need to be anticipating that and be ready for surveillance.”</p>



<p>For now, it’s unlikely malaria is going to spread all over the United States, Daily says. Even if more than five people develop malaria, she expects the current outbreak will end. “I hate for people to feel anxious going outside or getting mosquito bites. So, we can reassure the public: There’s ways to prevent [malaria], ways to treat it. It’s curable.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-input-fiber-making-philippines">Indigenous input revealed early hints of fiber making in the tropics</a></h4>

              
                <p>On the island of Palawan in the Philippines, a cave has yielded reams of ancient artifacts, including thousands of stone tools. No traces of hewn trees or stripped bark or carved meat remain to hint at what the tools may have been used for. But they do bear signs of wear and tear, prehistoric marks from the tasks they once aided.</p>

Xhauflair spent months living among Indigenous Pala’wan communities, studying how artisans use tools for various tasks in an effort to reveal how the ancient artifacts may have been used.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129361">H. Xhauflair</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To archaeologist Hermine Xhauflair and her colleagues, these marks can serve as fingerprints, identifying the ways past humans used the tools. For help deciphering these fingerprints, Xhauflair’s team turned to the Indigenous Pala’wan people, who live near the site where the artifacts were discovered and share a deep ancestral knowledge of how to process natural resources on the island. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wanted to learn from the experts of the forest,” says Xhauflair, of the University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>





<p>Thanks to that collaboration, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the oldest evidence of fiber making in the tropics</a> now goes back to 39,000 years, the researchers report June 30 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Access to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/textile-archaeologists-use-ancient-tools-weave-tapestry-past">fiber technologies</a> may have opened up all sorts of possibilities for nets, traps and boats, the scientists speculate (<em>SN: 8/28/19</em>).</p>



<p>One of the first steps in the study involved securing an introduction to the Pala’wan. Xhauflair presented her research plan to the councils of elders of several villages. The councils granted her and her colleagues permission to live with Pala’wan communities for three months and record craftspeople as they used tools for various tasks, including processing plant-based fibers.</p>



<p>After dissecting the techniques and identifying the 95 plant species that Pala’wan artisans were recorded using, the researchers built and tested a set of 16 stone tools that resemble those from the cave.</p>



<p>Xhauflair emulated Pala’wan techniques to strip and pull apart layers of plants such as bamboo and palm to make strong, flexible strips and other fibers. Many of the plants and techniques left distinct notches and striations on tool surfaces. Comparing the markings with those on the artifacts revealed striking similarities, which suggests that the ancient tools had been used in fiber making too.</p>

Xhauflair used re-created tools and Pala’wan techniques to make plant-based fibers. The process created markings on the tools that are like those of the ancient artifacts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remnants of ancient fibers are particularly rare, since the plant materials used to make them tend to decay quickly in the wet, humid tropics. The oldest evidence for fiber making anywhere in the world goes back roughly 120,000 years in Israel.</p>



<p>“The incorporation of Indigenous knowledge and many tool-use experiments on a wide range of fibrous plants give confidence” in the new findings, says archaeologist Richard Fullagar of Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The evidence for cutting fibrous plant parts is strong.”</p>



<p>The likenesses of the markings on the ancient tools to those made using Pala’wan techniques suggest that similar techniques have been used for at least 39,000 years. Whether such techniques have been passed down continuously over generations, or they disappeared and then were relearned, independently, later remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/static-electricity-pull-ticks-hosts">Static electricity can pull ticks on to their hosts</a></h4>

              
                <p>You don’t need to touch a tick for it find you, a new study suggests. The blood-sucking parasites may be able to catapult themselves from vegetation to their hosts thanks to static electricity.</p>



<p>Mammals, birds and reptiles carry considerable electrostatic charges — equivalent to voltages of hundreds to tens of thousands of volts. And ticks seem to respond to that. Tick nymphs brought close to various objects charged to voltages encountered in nature <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00772-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequently whoosh across the gap</a> to land on those surfaces, researchers report June 30 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“We know that static electric charges naturally accumulate on many animals, but how the forces generated by these electric charges influence the ecology of said animals has barely been studied,” says Sam England, a biologist at the University of Bristol in England.</p>



<p>Ticks are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ticks-here-stay-scientists-finding-ways-outsmart-bloodsuckers">fiendish parasites that feast on blood of vertebrates</a> and are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-lyme-and-other-tickborne-diseases-rising">notorious for spreading Lyme disease</a>, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other potentially debilitating diseases (<em>SN: 8/9/17; SN: 11/15/18</em>).</p>



<p>To see if ticks respond to the natural electric fields emanating from their potential hosts, England and his colleagues started with dried rabbit feet and acrylic surfaces charged by rubbing rabbit fur on them. Live castor bean tick nymphs (<em>Ixodes ricinus</em>) held anywhere from a few millimeters to a few centimeters away were readily yanked through the air to these surfaces, showing that electrical forces could carry the ticks across distances several times longer than they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team then placed 20 live nymphs, one at a time, on an aluminum plate sitting just a few millimeters below a tiny spherical steel electrode. When the electrode was charged to 750 volts — typical of voltages found on vertebrates — three out of four ticks traversed the gap. When the team repeated the experiment with the same number of ticks but no charge on the electrode, no nymphs zipped across.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An electrically charged nylon ball attracts a nearby tick (<em>Ixodes ricinus</em>), lifting it to the object’s surface by electrostatic forces. Since static charges are common on vertebrates, ticks might leverage the free ride to make the jump to potential hosts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By varying the voltage on the sphere and the distance between it and the plate, the team also found that dead nymphs could be lifted by an electric field comparable to that from human skin from about 10 centimeters, or four inches, away.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the electrostatic force in every case pulled the nymphs against gravity — an extreme scenario as ticks usually aren’t situated underneath a host in nature.</p>



<p>“This is quite unique given that ticks cannot jump to reach their hosts,” says Martin Giurfa, a neuroscientist at University of Toulouse in France who studies learning and memory in insects and who was not involved in the study. “The fact that they are teletransported by the electrostatic fields produced by their hosts … is remarkable.” It’s possible, he adds, that other parasites that latch on to skin might be similarly attracted to their hosts. Previous research has demonstrated how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/static-electricity-parasite-nematodes">parasitic nematodes</a> can use static electricity to catapult themselves on to fruit flies (<em>SN: 3/16/23</em>).</p>



<p>The findings suggest new anti-tick measures for people, England says. Outdoor clothing, for example, could be treated with an antistatic spray to reduce the tendency of these fabrics to accumulate static charge.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boys-experience-depression-differently-girls">Boys experience depression differently than girls. Here’s why that matters</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Teenagers in the United States are in crisis. That news got hammered home earlier this year following the release of a nationally representative survey showing that over half of high school girls reported persistent feelings of “sadness or hopelessness” — common words used to screen for depression. Almost a third of teenage boys reported those same feelings.</p>



<p>“No one is doing well,” says psychologist Kathleen Ethier. She heads the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Adolescent and School Health, which has overseen this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/yrbs_data_summary_and_trends.htm?s_cid=hy-DSTR1-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biennial Youth Risk Behavior Survey</a> since 1991.</p>





<p>During the latest round of data collection, in fall 2021, over 17,000 students from 31 states responded to roughly 100 questions related to mental health, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, sexual behavior, substance use and experiences of violence.</p>



<p>One chart in particular garnered considerable media attention. From 2011 to 2021, persistent sadness or hopelessness in boys went up 8 percentage points, from 21 to 29 percent. In girls, it rose a whopping 21 percentage points, from 36 to 57 percent.</p>



<p>Some of that disparity may arise from the fact that girls in the United States face unique stressors, researchers say. Compared with boys, girls seem more prone to experiencing mental distress from social media use, are more likely to experience sexual violence and are dealing with a political climate that is often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/abortion-roe-v-wade-pregnancy-biology-supreme-court-ruling">hostile to women’s rights</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>But the gap between boys and girls might not be as wide as the numbers indicate. Depression manifests differently in boys and men than in girls and women, mounting evidence suggests. Girls are more likely to internalize feelings, while boys are more likely to externalize them. Rather than crying when feeling down, for instance, boys may act irritated or lash out. Or they may engage in risky, impulsive or even violent acts. Inward-directed terms like “sadness” and “hopelessness” miss those more typically male tendencies. And masculine norms that equate sadness with weakness may make males who are experiencing those emotions less willing to admit it, even on an anonymous survey.</p>



<p>Consequently, screening tools, such as the one used by the CDC’s survey, may miss depression in about 1 in 10 males, research suggests.</p>



<p>“We need to have more of a recognition that boys and men, some of them, not all of them, are suffering,” says clinical psychologist Ryon McDermott of the University of South Alabama in Mobile. “And we miss them. We miss them in our assessments, and we miss them in our discussions.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Diagnosing depression in boys and men</h4>



<p>The idea of overlooked depression in men is not new. Take what happened on the Swedish island of Gotland. In the 1960s and ’70s, suicide rates were high. So in 1983, health officials launched an education program for Gotland doctors on depression treatment and suicide prevention.</p>



<p>At first, the program looked like a resounding success. The <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1992.tb01448.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island’s overall suicide rate dropped</a> from roughly 20 out of every 100,000 people in 1982 to roughly 7 out of every 100,000 people by 1985, researchers reported in the 1992 <em>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</em>.</p>



<p>But a subsequent, deeper analysis showed that the decline was almost entirely among women. In the 2½ years before and after the program, the number of women dying by suicide decreased from 11 to two, while the number of men dying by suicide mostly stayed steady, seeing a marginal decline from 16 to 15.</p>





<p>Men struggling with suicidal thoughts appear less likely to seek help and more likely to have doctors ignore their depressive symptoms when they do seek help, Wolfgang Rutz, then a psychiatrist at a Gotland hospital, theorized in 1996 in the <em>Nordic Journal of Psychiatry</em>. Doctors observed, for instance, that men who were depressed often didn’t present with classic symptoms, such as sadness, but instead presented as hostile, impulsive and aggressive.</p>



<p>Rutz suspected that this gender disparity in diagnosis and treatment might underpin why, at the time, men in Sweden were being diagnosed with depression half as often as women but dying by suicide five times as often. Without obvious signs of depression, Rutz noted, to the outside observer, many male suicides occurred seemingly without warning.</p>



<p>“The criteria of depression that are taught in psychiatric textbooks and diagnostic manuals today and which also have been used in the Gotland project seem insufficient in detecting <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/08039489609099732?journalCode=ipsc20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the typical masculine way of being depressive</a>,” Rutz wrote.</p>



<p>Rutz went on to develop a screening tool for male depression, which paved the way for more recent male-specific tools. They include the Male Depression Risk Scale, developed by Simon Rice, a clinical psychologist at Orygen, an Australian nonprofit research, clinical and advocacy institute focused on youth mental health.</p>



<p>The scale focuses on emotion suppression, anger and aggression; drug and alcohol use; somatic symptoms, such as concerns about sleep and sex; and risk-taking. Participants rate various statements, such as how often they bottle up negative feelings, have difficulty managing anger or use drugs for temporary relief. None of the questions ask about sadness or hopelessness.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Better screening</h3>



<p>The Male Depression Risk Scale asks individuals to rate how often over the last month various statements (some shown below) apply to them. </p>



<ul>
<li>I bottled up my negative feelings.</li>



<li>I had unexplained aches and pains.</li>



<li>I needed alcohol to help me unwind.</li>



<li>I overreacted to situations with aggressive behavior.</li>



<li>I stopped caring about the consequences of my actions.</li>



<li>It was difficult to manage my anger.</li>



<li>Using drugs provided temporary relief.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>Research shows that some men meet the criteria for depression on the Male Depression Risk Scale but not on more traditional scales. In a recent study of 1,000 Canadian men, Rice and his team found that 80 respondents, or 8 percent, met the criteria for depression only on a traditional scale that includes a question about how often the respondent has felt “down, depressed or hopeless.” In addition, 120 respondents, or 12 percent, met the criteria on both scales. But 110 respondents, or 11 percent, met the criteria for depression only <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32401094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the men’s scale</a>, the team reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Mental Health</em>.</p>



<p>The results suggest that had the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey included a male-specific question about depression, there might still have been a gender gap but perhaps a smaller one.</p>



<p>Too many boys and men are suffering in silence, says Rice, who is also a principal research fellow at the University of Melbourne. Ten or 11 percent of missed cases “might sound like a small percentage,” he says, “but at the population level, that is huge.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is it depression or something else?</h4>



<p>The idea that acting out and aggression could, on occasion, constitute symptoms of depression remains controversial.</p>



<p>The CDC, Ethier says, has relied on extensive research in formulating its survey’s depression-related question, which reads: “During the past 12 months, did you ever feel so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that you stopped doing some usual activities?”</p>



<p>“That item is actually quite good at predicting who has depressive symptoms,” Ethier says, adding that such accuracy holds true for both girls and boys.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that boys aren’t struggling, Ethier says. Anecdotally, for instance, teachers are reporting a spike in behavioral problems in their classrooms, particularly among boys. But rather than indicating depression, Ethier says, such behavior is emblematic of the broader mental health crisis among teens.</p>



<p>That might sound like splitting hairs. If boys are distressed, why not label them as depressed? Providing the proper diagnosis matters for appropriate treatment and future health outcomes, Ethier says. “We know that depressive symptoms in adolescence have long-term implications for health and mental health. I don’t know that the research is as conclusive about that for behavioral issues in the classroom.”</p>



<p>For McDermott, who studies the difficulties of measuring depression, such behavioral problems could indicate other disorders, chiefly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. But he has no doubt that some of those boys are depressed. “It is hard to say with 100 percent certainty that all boys who are acting out are experiencing depression, but it is a good bet that many of them are,” he says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Depths of despair</h3>



<p>Over the last decade, a national survey of U.S. high school students called the Youth Risk Behavior Survey has consistently found higher levels of persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in teen girls compared with teen boys. But some experts say the survey may not offer a complete picture of boys’ mental health.</p>

<p>The core symptoms of depression, whether internal or external in nature, are the same in men and women, McDermott says. But on a depression scale focusing on internalizing symptoms such as sadness or hopelessness, a depressed man would, on average, score lower than an equally depressed woman.</p>



<p>Why those baselines vary by gender isn’t entirely clear, McDermott says. But when it comes to hopelessness, evidence suggests that boys might sometimes suppress those feelings in adherence to male norms that discourage vulnerability. Consider the results of a review of 74 studies with a total sample size of more than 19,000 mostly U.S. participants published in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Counseling Psychology</em>. High scores on a scale measuring <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2016-56584-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conformity to Western masculine norms</a>, such as emotional control, self-reliance and power over women, were linked with poorer mental health, including depression, and a reduced likelihood of seeking help.</p>



<p>Gender norms become entrenched during the teen years, says Leslie Adams, a behavioral researcher at Johns Hopkins University. That’s when boys are really absorbing messages around masculinity from friends, family and social media. “Endorsing feelings of sadness and hopelessness kind of goes against these learned, general scripts,” Adams says.</p>



<p>Those male scripts are poorly understood, say Adams and others studying male mental health, because most gender research focuses on girls and women.</p>



<p>For instance, take research into social media use. Ethier points to the popularity of male social media personalities espousing harmful attitudes toward women, such as TikToker Andrew Tate, who was recently arrested in Romania on suspicion of human trafficking. Anecdotally, Tate and influencers like him are one way boys come to understand the world, but data on the influence of social media on boys are sparse, Ethier says.</p>



<p>“We focus a lot on the ways that social media might be impacting girls in terms of body image,” she says. “I don’t think we focus enough of the conversation on what is being portrayed to boys.”</p>



<p>The resulting knowledge gap about boys’ lives affects all of society. “It is difficult to see that we can effectively address the health of boys and young men, achieve gender equity for girls and young women, or achieve rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth, without <a href="https://www.jahonline.org/action/showPdf?pii=S1054-139X%2817%2930321-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tackling the masculine identities adopted by boys</a> in adolescence,” a group of pediatric health experts wrote in a commentary in 2018 in the <em>Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Depression’s link to suicide</h4>



<p>Just as Rutz observed on the island of Gotland, missing depression in boys and men can come with high stakes.</p>



<p>“Depression can manifest in many ways … beyond sadness and hopelessness,” Adams says. “When we don’t assess the other ways that depression can manifest, there are implications. One is suicide.”</p>



<p>Adams suspects that the same tendency to frame depression as an internal emotion also influences how researchers ask about suicide. For instance, asking about who has considered suicide or made a plan, as the CDC does in its youth survey, reflects the belief that the respondent is both ruminating and thinking ahead. “For boys, [suicide] may not have that linear path,” Adams says. “We’re missing … impulsivity.”</p>



<p>That could help explain why, in the CDC survey, teen girls reported higher levels of suicidal thinking, planning and attempts than boys, despite the fact that boys die by suicide at higher rates. Provisional federal data show that, in 2021, roughly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 of every 100,000 girls ages 15 to 24 died by suicide</a>. That’s compared with roughly 24 of every 100,000 boys of the same age. From 2020 to 2021, the rate of suicide in that age group increased 5 percent in girls compared with 8 percent in boys.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Suicide stats&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The latest data in the United States show that the overall suicide rate for males is much higher than for females. That gap holds across most age groups, even though teen girls report higher levels of suicidal thinking and planning than boys.</p>

<p>Access to guns might factor in here. For every 10 percent increase in household gun ownership in a state, the <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)32383-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">youth suicide rate increases by about 27 percent</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>. And boys are seven times as likely to kill themselves with a gun than girls are, according to a 2022 report by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun violence prevention organization.</p>



<p>Missed depression in boys could help explain a long-standing research question, Adams and others say: Why do more women get diagnosed with depression, the most common precursor to suicide, when more men die by suicide?</p>



<p>One path forward is to look beyond sadness and hopelessness as proxies for depression, Adams says. What about impulsivity, conflict with others or social withdrawal? Perhaps those symptoms serve as better proxies for depression — and suicidal thinking — in men, she says.</p>



<p>Understanding other proxies could protect not just depressed individuals from harm but also broader society, another line of research suggests. Seena Fazel, a forensic psychiatrist at the University of Oxford, and colleagues began examining data from Swedish patient registries to investigate if depression links to violent behavior. Their participant pool included about 47,000 adults diagnosed with depression from 2001 to 2009 and nearly 900,000 people without such a diagnosis.</p>



<p>People with depression were three times as likely to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-57580-022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commit a violent crime</a>, such as assault, arson or a sexual offense, as individuals without depression, the team reported in 2015 in <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>To attempt to rule out genetic or environmental differences, the team looked at siblings. A person with depression was twice as likely to commit a violent crime as their sibling without depression. Fazel and another team reported a similar <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856717302290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link between depression and violence among teens and young adults</a> in 2017 in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>The link between violence and depression has been found for both men and women. But since men commit most violent crimes, missing depression in men is a concern, Fazel says.</p>



<p>But he stresses the importance of keeping such findings in perspective. His earlier work, for instance, found that over a 13-year period in Sweden, there were 450 violent crimes committed per 10,000 people. Of those, 24 were committed by people with severe mental illness. “With guns and mental illness,” Fazel says, “you are much more likely to kill yourself than kill somebody else.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Shifting views on depression</h4>



<p>The idea that depression may look different in men and women — not to mention <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">differences based on other demographic factors</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/23, p. 18</em>) — is gaining traction.</p>



<p>For instance, a 2022 revision to the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, or <em>DSM</em>, the American Psychiatric Association’s reference book, acknowledges the gender differences in depression. The revision’s authors note that, compared with depressed women, depressed men tend to report “greater frequencies and intensities of maladaptive self-coping and problem-solving strategies, including alcohol or other drug misuse, risk-taking and poor impulse control.”</p>



<p>Even before the revision, the <em>DSM</em> included “irritable mood” as a feature of depression in youngsters. So teenagers’ age and gender both potentially influence how they express depression.</p>



<p>Even if the idea that depression looks different in boys and girls gains wider acceptance, changing the Youth Risk Behavior Survey will take time. If enough experts express concerns about how questions related to mental health are posed, then the earliest the CDC could amend the survey would be for the 2025 round of data collection, a CDC spokesperson told <em>Science News</em>.</p>



<p>But the experts I spoke with are hopeful that such changes will trickle into other mainstream research. Even adding a single word to questions, such as asking about irritability in addition to sadness and hopelessness, could identify a huge number of depressed boys who might otherwise appear fine, these researchers argue.</p>



<p>Tweaks of this nature, Rice says, “could be a game changer at identifying depression in boys [and] young men.”</p>

<p><em>BMJ Open</em> has retracted a paper describing a study in which people with diabetes will be switched from cigarettes to vaping after the journal learned – late in the process of publication – that the authors were indirectly funded by the tobacco company, Philip Morris International.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/4/e045396">International randomised controlled trial evaluating metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetic cigarette smokers following switching to combustion-free nicotine delivery systems: the DIASMOKE protocol</a>,” was originally published on April 1, 2021. Its <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/6/e045396ret">retraction notice</a>, dated June 20, 2023, reads:</p>



<span id="more-127370"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This article has been retracted by the journal and publisher following a post-publication review of the funding source. This paper is in breach of BMJ Open’s policy not to publish research that has been funded by the tobacco industry, and therefore we have retracted this paper.</p>



<p>Following a query raised post-publication, BMJ now understands that ECLAT SRL (the listed funder) receives sponsorship from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, which is a not for profit group supported and funded by the tobacco company, Philip Morris International. The authors added a disclaimer to the article, referring to Foundation for a Smoke Free World (FSFW) as the “grantor,” when the article was revised as part of the pre-publication peer-review process. The addition of this information and its significance was not specifically brought to the editor’s attention by the authors. Had this been done, the article would not have been published. BMJ Open’s <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/2013/10/15/journal-policy-on-research-funded-by-the-tobacco-industry/">Editorial Policy</a> states that the journal will not consider for publication any study which has been partly or wholly funded by the tobacco industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is not the first time links to the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/04/21/journal-retracts-paper-suggesting-smoking-is-linked-to-lower-covid-19-risk/">prompted a retraction</a>.</p>



<p>The corresponding author of the paper, Arkadiusz Krysinski, of the Polish Academy of Sciences’ Mossakowski Medical Research Centre in Warsaw, and CK MSW, also in&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warsaw, did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>We asked Adrian Aldcroft, editor in chief of <em>BMJ Open</em>, how the authors should have brought &#8220;this information and its significance&#8221; to its attention, and whether the journal had considered any changes to its processes based on the episode. He told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors added their &#8220;disclaimer&#8221; relating to FSFW after peer review rather than including it as part of their funding statement, where we would expect to see this information. The authors did not draw our attention to the disclaimer when they submitted their revision (e.g., in the cover letter or the point by point response). As such, the disclaimer went unnoticed by the editor. The editor was not aware of the link between ECLAT (the stated funder) and FSFW (and, by extension, PMI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This case has highlighted for us the link, which is not immediately apparent, between the tobacco industry and products intended to help smokers, such as e-cigarettes. Our editors are now more careful assessing the COIs of any study relating to smokers and smoking. BMJ is also revising the tobacco policy and related processes across the portfolio in an effort to avoid similar cases in the future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-new-view-milky-way-space">Neutrinos offer a new view of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have made the first image of the Milky Way using neutrinos.</p>



<p>The extremely low-mass subatomic particles have no electric charge, and pass easily through gas, dust and even stars on their way from the places where they originate to detectors here on Earth. High-energy neutrinos zip throughout the cosmos, but where they come from is usually a mystery.</p>



<p>Now, by combining artificial intelligence and data collected over the course of a decade with the IceCube detector in Antarctica, researchers have found the first evidence of high-energy neutrinos that originated from inside the Milky Way and mapped the particles onto an image of the galaxy’s plane. It’s the first time our galaxy has been imaged with anything other than light.</p>





<p>The map includes suggestions of <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific high-energy neutrino sources within the Milky Way</a> that might be the remnants of past supernova star explosions, the cores of collapsed supergiant stars or other as-yet-unidentified objects, the team reports in the June 30 <em>Science</em>. But more research is needed to clearly pick those sorts of features out of the data.</p>



<p>Previously, only a few high-energy neutrinos have been traced back to their potential birthplaces, all outside the Milky Way. Those include two that appeared to come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-black-holes-stars-tidal-disruption-event">black holes shredding their companion star</a>s and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-blazar-icecube">others from a highly active galaxy known as a blazar</a> (<em>SN: 5/16/22, SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>“We’re quite unambiguously seeing neutrinos from both galactic and extragalactic space these days,” says physicist Kate Scholberg of Duke University who was not involved with the research. “There’s so much more to learn, and it can be tremendous fun to figure out how to see the universe with neutrino eyes.”</p>



<p>Neutrino astronomy could potentially allow us to see distant objects in a way that no other telescopes can match. That’s because neutrinos can cross huge expanses of space without being absorbed or deflected. X-rays, gamma rays, optical light and the charged particles that make up cosmic rays, on the other hand, can be deflected or absorbed along the way, which may obscure their origins.</p>



<p>To physicist Naoko Kurahashi Neilson of Drexel University in Philadelphia, the map she and her team produced is the latest contribution to a shift in neutrino science. In the past, neutrino observatories like IceCube haven’t provided the sorts of views of the sky that telescopes relying on optical light, X-rays or gamma rays offer.</p>



<p>“When I first joined IceCube,”  Kurahashi Neilson says, “I used to do air quotes” when using the phrase <em>neutrino astronomy</em>. “I don&#8217;t do that anymore.… I don&#8217;t have to because we&#8217;re starting to resolve things” in neutrino images that resemble the astronomical images from other telescopes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Three ways to map the Milky Way</h3>



<p>In these three views, the Milky Way is seen in visible light (top), in gamma rays (middle) and in high-energy neutrinos (bottom). This first-ever particle-based map is based on data collected with the enormous IceCube detector embedded deep in the Antarctic ice. Dust obscures portions of the visible light map, and gamma rays can come from a variety of sources. Neutrinos have the potential to pinpoint locations where high-energy cosmic rays coming from supernova remnants, the cores of collapsed stellar giants and other as-yet-unidentified sources interact with dust in the galaxy, creating the neutrinos.</p>

<p>The downside of neutrinos is that they’re extremely hard to detect. The IceCube experiment is enormous in part to overcome that challenge. It consists of 5,160 sensors in a cubic array one kilometer on a side embedded deep in the Antarctic ice. The large size of the experiment increases the odds of seeing a tiny fraction of the neutrinos flying through space from the Milky Way and other places in the cosmos.</p>





<p>Of the 100,000 or so neutrinos that IceCube scientists observe each year, some leave long tracks in the detector that potentially point back to where the neutrinos came from. Many of the neutrino signals in IceCube, though, are known as cascade events. They make bursts of light in the detector, but don’t reveal neutrino origins as well as tracks can.</p>



<p>“This is data we used to throw away in terms of astronomy,”  Kurahashi Neilson says. There’s still information indicating where the neutrinos come from in the data. But it’s difficult to identify the promising cascades in the hundreds of thousands of meaningless, background events that IceCube has collected.</p>



<p>Kurahashi Neilson decided to take up the challenge by plowing through a decade of IceCube cascade data with the help of an artificial intelligence system known as a neural network. “You can train the neural nets to identify which events are worth keeping … [and] which events are more background-like,”  Kurahashi Neilson says.</p>



<p>It’s an approach Kurahashi Neilson pioneered in 2017 and steadily improved until she and her colleagues were able to identify the neutrinos used in the new map.</p>



<p>“It’s an impressive analysis and the techniques may well not yet be pushed to their limits,” Scholberg says. “Clearly a lot more work needs to be done, but it’s very exciting to see the basic expectation [of Milky Way neutrinos] verified. This is an important step forward in understanding of the high-energy particle sky.”</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abh2890">Light-induced mobile factors from shoots regulate rhizobium-triggered soybean root nodulation</a>,” was published in September 2021 and has been cited 43 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice, published today, states:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127400"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The editors have been made aware that data presented in Fig. 5 assessed GmNSP1 expression rather than GmNIN expression. We are alerting readers to these concerns while the authors provide additional data to correct the manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for the journal told Retraction Watch two separate individuals had emailed the editorial team about an issue in the paper, with the most recent email arriving earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Science</em> editors contacted the authors of the paper, who acknowledged the problem and said the error in the figure was unintentional, the spokesperson said. The authors also told <em>Science</em> correcting the error wouldn’t change the conclusions of the paper and offered to provide more data to address the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked about the decision to allow the authors to submit replacement data. The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Science</em> editorial, after consulting advisers, agreed to allow the authors of the study to provide additional data to correct Figure 5. Under these circumstances, while <em>Science</em> waits for the data, and in order to alert our readers as to the need for amendments to the paper, we are posting an Editorial Expression of Concern. After the sought after data is provided, <em>Science</em> editorial will review it to confirm it represents and matches what the authors had published in 2021.&nbsp; At that point, the authors may need to further provide corrections to the text and figures of their 2021 study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-exploit-third-wild-vertebrate-species-animals">Humans exploit about one-third of wild vertebrate species</a></h4>

              
                <p>The aptly named resplendent quetzal is prized for its plumage. Golden poison frogs are popular creatures in the pet trade. Pangolin meat is considered a delicacy, and their scales are used in traditional medicine.</p>



<p>Those three animals are among the third of all wild vertebrate species that people eat, trade or otherwise use, a new study reveals.&nbsp; Out of nearly 47,000 vertebrate species around the world, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-04940-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humans exploit about 14,600</a>, researchers report June 29 in <em>Communications Biology </em>in a comprehensive look at humans’ impact on a vast swathe of wildlife.</p>





<p>Some species, like fish trawled from the sea in large quantities for food, are abundant. But human activities are helping push many others of these exploited species toward extinction, marine ecologist Boris Worm and colleagues say.</p>



<p>More than half of the vertebrate species that humans exploit — mostly fish and mammals — are killed for food, the team finds. Birds, reptiles and amphibians are primarily targeted for the pet trade. And about 8 percent of exploited species are recreationally hunted for sport or trophies. Other uses include medicine or clothing, and more than a quarter of the species are used for more than one purpose.</p>



<p>Worm, of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and colleagues collated data compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, which tracks the trade, use and vulnerability of species worldwide. The team considered species from the six classes of vertebrates that contain more than 100 species each: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, ray-finned fishes (such as tuna and salmon) and cartilaginous fishes (a group that includes sharks, rays and skates).</p>



<p>About 13 percent of all vertebrate species facing extinction — those classified by the IUCN as either vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered — are threatened at least in part due to human exploitation, the team found. That includes 5,775, or 39 percent, of the species the study identified as used by humans.</p>



<p>The rise of advanced hunting and fishing technology, as well as global trade and a burgeoning human population, have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-indeed">increasingly skewed the balance of many ecosystems in favor of people and against other species</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/07</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Worm and his colleagues, and some other scientists, think of humans as predators, that’s not quite correct, says Daniel Pauly, a fisheries biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not involved in the study. “Predators are regulated by natural processes, but humans are not.”</p>



<p>The team’s findings, Pauly says, “describe the impact of our mad consumption of the world.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boreal-forest-north-america-shrink">The snow forest of North America may be about to shrink</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of nature’s woody behemoths — the North American snow forest — may soon begin shrinking.</p>



<p>The continent’s boreal forest reposes in subarctic latitudes, spanning much of Alaska and Canada. Scientists had previously suggested that its range might shift northward as the climate warms, helping maintain its expansive breadth.</p>



<p>But for two decades, the ecosystem’s northern tree line has held fast, while its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39092-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">southerly tree cover has thinned</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Human activities and climate change could push the prodigious forest to contract.</p>





<p>“We are about to transform an entire biome on a continental scale,” says environmental scientist Ronny Rotbarth of Wageningen University in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Millions of people — many from Indigenous groups — depend on the boreal forest to live. It’s thought to contain <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00090/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 25 percent</a> of Earth’s remaining intact forest, and its living flora are estimated to store about <a href="https://carbon2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 billion metric tons of carbon</a>. That exceeds what global fossil fuel burning emitted last year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But the forest is being disturbed, and not just by climate change. Logging and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfires-boreal-forests-record-co2-2021">wildfires</a> — such as those now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-us-east-coast-climate">raging in Quebec</a> — can also diminish it (<em>SN: 3/2/23</em>;<em> SN: 6/9/23</em>).</p>



<p>Rotbarth and his colleagues assessed how those pressures were impacting the forest’s range. Using satellite observations, the researchers tracked tree-cover changes from 2000 to 2019. They then analyzed how those changes corresponded with temperature, precipitation and disturbances like wildfires and logging.</p>



<p>Overall, the forest’s tree cover increased, mostly within its northern interior. But its northern boundary showed little to no expansion, while its southern boundary thinned, largely due to wildfires and logging. The researchers also found that the southerly reaches didn’t fully recover from these disturbances during the study period, potentially hindered by climate warming.</p>



<p>The changes may foreshadow a long-term forest contraction, though it’s unclear when exactly that could start.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-gravitational-wave-black-hole">A newfound gravitational wave ‘hum’ may be from the universe’s biggest black holes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Beneath the explosions, collisions and other intermittent bangs in the cosmos, scientists suspect a nonstop soundtrack plays, created by ripples in spacetime continually washing through the universe. After more than a decade of searching, scientists may have finally heard that background hum.</p>



<p>Several teams of researchers from around the world reported on June 28 the first clear evidence of these gravitational waves. Unlike previously detected gravitational waves, these new ones have ripples that are staggeringly long — on the scale of light-years. Their likely source: innumerable pairs of gargantuan black holes, which churn the spacetime cauldron as they orbit one another.</p>





<p>If that hunch is correct, the result would provide the first evidence that pairs of monster black holes, with masses billions of times that of the sun, can coalesce into one.</p>



<p>If the gravitational waves are real, and if they truly are a signal of supermassive black hole pairs, “it’s miraculous,” says astrophysicist Meg Urry of Yale University. “It’s extremely interesting, because we have essentially no handle on what the most massive black holes are doing.”</p>

<p>Gravitational waves are produced by accelerating, massive objects. As these waves careen through the universe, they rumple the fabric of spacetime upon which reality is embroidered. In 2015, scientists with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction?mode=magazine&amp;context=1679">detected gravitational waves for the first time</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). Those waves were spawned by mergers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">relatively puny black holes</a>, entirely different beasts than the supermassive ones that lurk at the centers of galaxies (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>).</p>



<p>While LIGO picks up gravitational wave blips that can last mere fractions of a second, orbiting supermassive black holes are expected to pump out waves continually for millions of years, creating ripples that blanket the cosmos with their constant hum. “This is a very different sort of thing, very new sort of thing,” says LIGO researcher Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. “That is awesome.”</p>



<p>Across the universe, galaxies regularly mingle and merge. As they do, scientists suspected, their supermassive black holes would orbit one another and emit gravitational waves. Many pairs of black holes would be doing this orbital dance at once, in the many merging galaxies scattered throughout the cosmos, all sending their spacetime ripples out into space.</p>



<p>“The Earth is just randomly bumping around on this sea of gravitational waves,” says astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin of West Virginia University in Morgantown and a member of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, or NANOGrav.</p>



<p>Detecting this mishmash of gravitational waves is not easy. The task required scientists to MacGyver the Milky Way, turning the galaxy into a gravitational wave detector by timing the clocklike ticking of dead, spinning remnants of exploded stars called pulsars, which emit beams of radio waves as they twirl. These beams sweep past Earth at regular intervals, like the precise ticks of a clock. Gravitational waves stretching and squeezing the space between the pulsars and Earth cause the pulsars’ ticks, observed with a variety of radio telescopes around the world, to come early or late.</p>



<p>To ensure that they were seeing the gravitational waves, rather than uninteresting jitters, the researchers looked for a special type of correlation between different pulsars. Pulsars near one another on the sky should show similar timing shifts, but those that are at right angles to one another should observe opposite shifts: One pulsar’s blips come early while the other’s come late.</p>



<p>That compelling hallmark has finally been observed, NANOGrav researchers reported June 28 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. “There’s nothing in nature that can mimic this,” says Chiara Mingarelli, an astrophysicist at Yale University and NANOGrav researcher. “Only gravitational waves can make that.” Their result was based on 15 years spent monitoring dozens of pulsars.</p>





<p>“It’s really invigorating stuff,” says astrophysicist Michael Keith of the University of Manchester in England, a member of the European Pulsar Timing Array, or EPTA.</p>



<p>The EPTA team spent an even longer time staring at pulsars — a quarter of a century. “We were getting to the point where we were starting to think maybe the signal is just so weak, we’ll never ever find it,” Keith says. But the telltale correlation between pulsars was also evident in the EPTA results, which were reported in a series of papers accepted in&nbsp;<em>Astronomy and Astrophysics </em>with researchers from the Indian Pulsar Timing Array.</p>



<p>Some scientists have thought that supermassive black holes in merging galaxies would never draw close enough to coalesce with one another, or to emit gravitational waves like the ones observed. “It’s actually been a sore spot for our field for many years,” Mingarelli says.</p>



<p>In contrast, the gravitational wave signal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-weird-secrets-early-universe">seems to be stronger than expected</a> (<em>SN</em>: 6/3/23). That suggests, “there are many black holes, they merge happily, and black holes also grow [to large masses] very happily,” says astrophysicist Marta Volonteri of Institut d&#8217;Astrophysique de Paris, who was not involved with the new research.</p>

<p>Future work could reveal more about supermassive black holes and their environs, says astronomer Ryan Shannon of Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.</p>



<p>“Understanding better the demographics of these supermassive black holes is going to help us understand how galaxies form and evolve,” says Shannon, a researcher on the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array in Australia, which also reported independent results in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and<strong> </strong>in a paper accepted in <em>Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia</em>. A shorter-term effort, from the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array, reported its results in <em>Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics</em>.</p>



<p>The teams stopped just short of declaring an ironclad detection of the background of gravitational waves, rather presenting their results as strong evidence for the ripples. Taken individually, their results don’t quite meet the most stringent standards for statistical significance set by physicists. In future work, the teams plan to combine their data, in hopes of further solidifying the detection.</p>



<p>And although supermassive black holes are the simplest explanation for the waves’ origins, researchers still can’t rule out a more exotic provenance. For example, the ripples might have arisen from inflation, the period just after the Big Bang when the universe is thought to have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inflation-trial">expanded incredibly rapidly</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/12</em>).</p>



<p>Whatever the source, the future study of these gravitational waves is bound to have ripple effects.</p>

                A globe-spanning group of physicists used pulsars to measure the waves, which they believe emanated from pairs of supermassive black holes.
