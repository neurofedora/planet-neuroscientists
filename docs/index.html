<p>Despite their retracted status, problematic articles that present unreliable information, critical errors, non-reproducible results, or fabricated data frequently continue to be propagated in the scholarly literature through continued citations. There are good reasons for citing retracted work, for example to critically discuss the information presented in the article, or in studies pertaining to the field of research integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the majority of cases, retracted publications continue to be cited as if the retraction had not occurred. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2020.824">studies</a> of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03631-1">citation</a> of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00155">retracted</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-023-02316-z">publications</a>, only between 5% and 20% of citations acknowledge the retracted status of the article or are critical of the article. A lack of awareness of the retracted status of a publication may be a significant contributing factor to the perpetuation of citing the article after the retraction event occurred.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://dapp.orvium.io/deposits/65156660ae17eb5761deb67d/view">Previous</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2024.111427">research</a> has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2022-072929">found</a> that the fact an article has been retracted is often inconsistently displayed across different resources, creating challenges for authors seeking out articles to refine their research questions, develop their approaches, or contextualize their findings. The continued citation and inclusion of retracted work without appropriate discussion or acknowledgement of its retracted status in subsequent studies, poses a direct threat to the reliability of the published literature and the overall trust in research and scholarship.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">So how do we better disseminate the editorial status of retracted work? With the support of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the <a href="https://sloan.org/grant-detail/G-2022-19409">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>, a group of 26 mission-driven cross-industry representatives have been working for the past two years to propose recommended practice guidelines for metadata transfer and display of published work that has been retracted, removed, or flagged with an expression of concern (EOC). The final product of this work, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3789/niso-rp-45-2024">the NISO Recommended Practice for Communication of Retractions, Removals, and Expressions of Concern (CREC)</a>, was published on June 27, 2024. </p>



<p>The CREC Working Group included representatives from publishers, aggregators, web vendors, libraries, universities and others. Together, we developed a recommended practice that describes the essential data elements required to effectively communicate retractions, removals and EOCs with readers and other end users. Furthermore, the recommended practice lays out the parties involved in and responsible for the communications of these editorial decisions. Of note, the CREC guidelines do not advise editors on issuing editorial decisions, rather these guidelines are intended to ensure information regarding retractions, removals, and EOCs are disseminated effectively, transparently, and rapidly, so that the updated editorial status of the work is imminently clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To combat continued inappropriate citations of retracted articles, the NISO CREC recommended practice presents a number of items that ensure post-publication editorial action is easily identified by both human and machine readers, through publisher platforms as well as other aggregators. The recommendations include guidance on the required meta-data elements, their transfer, and display. Furthermore, the guidelines identify the parties responsible for each step of the correct dissemination of the information regarding the updated editorial status of the affected article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the recommendations discuss more complicated situations, such as simultaneous, large-scale retraction cases linked to manipulation of the publication process, editorial action taken on the pre-versions of record, guidance for the dissemination of retractions, removals, and EOCs following change of publishers, and recommendations for the sharing of this information involving materials published in languages other than English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s where we need the community’s help.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While the NISO CREC recommended practice is now available, its effectiveness largely depends on its adoption. As such, the members of the NISO CREC working group encourage publishers, repositories, abstracting and indexing providers, researchers, journalists, and readers to share the CREC guidelines with their respective networks to increase awareness and encourage their adoption into the wider industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last but not least, the CREC working group anticipates that the publishing industry will change over time, and we also acknowledge that there were topics such as a proposed taxonomy and suppression of HTML that we were unable to fully resolve in the current version of the CREC guidelines. To ensure that the recommended practice remains relevant and current in this evolving landscape, a CREC standing committee will be formed to continue to monitor the changes and needs in the industry, and to issue updates to the recommended practice when relevant.</p>



<p><em>Caitlin Bakker, Discovery Technologies Librarian at the University of Regina, and Maria Zalm, Senior Editor for Publication Ethics at the Public Library of Science (PLOS), were the co-chair and a member, respectively, of the NISO CREC Working Group. (Retraction Watch co-founder Ivan Oransky was not a co-author of this post but was also a member of the Working Group.)</em></p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zerfu2-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" decoding="async" /><p><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself </strong></p>
<p>As a research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), I specialize in the intersection of agriculture, nutrition, and health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). My primary focus is Ethiopia&#8217;s National Information Platform for Nutrition (NiPN), which serves as a vital resource hub for nutrition-related data and interventions. Through the NiPN, our aim is to drive evidence-based policy decisions, implement effective nutrition programs, and improve maternal and child health outcomes by fostering collaboration among stakeholders.</p>
<p>With a background in Food Science and Nutrition from Addis Ababa University and a Master&#8217;s in Public Health from Jimma University, I have led impactful research projects in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, and the UK. My contributions have been recognized through awards such as the Tore Godal Medal. I am fully committed to deepening our understanding of the complex connections between agriculture, nutrition, and health to develop strategies that effectively improve public health in underserved communities. For more information about my work, please visit my profiles at the IFPRI and the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Systems.</p>
<p><strong>How does your work relate to the SDGs? Which SDGs specifically?</strong></p>
<p>My work closely aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. Specifically, my research and projects have contributed to several SDGs.</p>
<p>Improving agricultural practices and nutritional outcomes can significantly impact poverty reduction, aligning with SDG 1, to end poverty. By enhancing the productivity and sustainability of smallholder farmers and ensuring better nutritional health, my work contributes to breaking the poverty cycle.</p>
<p>My primary focus on agriculture, nutrition, and health directly addressed SDG 2, which aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. By researching the impact of livestock farming and animal-source foods on maternal and child nutrition, this study contributes to developing strategies that can improve food security and nutritional outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>My work also supports SDG 3, which seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. By studying the links between diet, particularly animal-source foods, and health outcomes, my research helps inform interventions that can reduce malnutrition and improve overall health, particularly in vulnerable populations such as mothers and children.</p>
<p>My research often touches on gender issues such as women&#8217;s roles in agriculture and their access to resources and nutritional information. This supports SDG 5, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower both women and girls. Ensuring that women have access to nutritious food and the ability to improve their livelihoods through agriculture are key components of my work.</p>
<p>Collaboration is essential for achieving SDGs. My work involves partnering with various stakeholders, including academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and governmental bodies. This aligns with SDG 17, which emphasizes the importance of partnerships in achieving sustainable development.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges have you faced in your research? How did you work to overcome these?</strong></p>
<p>In my research career, I have confronted significant challenges demanding creativity and perseverance. One major obstacle I encountered was the limited access to reliable data and resources in low- and middle-income countries. To overcome this, I established partnerships with local institutions and utilized technology for remote data collection and analysis, which helped mitigate resource constraints.</p>
<p>Another complex aspect of my research was navigating ethical and cultural sensitivities, particularly in diverse cultural settings involving vulnerable populations. To address this, I made sure to adhere to high ethical standards and actively engage with the communities I was studying. This approach ensured that my research was culturally appropriate and ethically sound. Additionally, conducting research in variable and unpredictable field conditions required me to adopt adaptable approaches and maintain robust communication channels with my field teams.</p>
<p>One of the challenges I encountered was translating my research findings into practical interventions and policies. This was due to gaps between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. To bridge these gaps, I focused on disseminating my findings through policy briefs and involving stakeholders from the beginning of the research process. This ensured that my research had relevance and could be translated into actionable steps. Furthermore, promoting sustainability in my research involved various strategies such as capacity building, community empowerment, and advocating for the integration of successful interventions into existing systems.</p>
<p>Overall, these challenges have emphasized the importance of collaboration, ethical rigor, adaptability, effective communication, and sustainability in my research endeavours. Achieving SDGs in my research field promises a world of food security, health, economic stability, gender equality, and effective partnerships, creating a sustainable and equitable future.</p>

<p>The paper with matching data, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778824004705?via%3Dihub">Optimizing smart building energy systems for sustainable living: A realistic approach to enhance renewable energy consumfaption [sic] and reduce emissions in residential buildings</a>,” appeared online as an “article in press” in Elsevier’s <em>Energy and Buildings </em>in May<em>.</em> </p>



<span id="more-129537"></span>



<p>Sadrizadeh told us the methodology reported in the article was “so amusing that I felt compelled to share it” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ssad_kth-mdu-academicmisconduct-activity-7201577707405549569-vceW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">on LinkedIn</a>. In his post, Sadrizadeh calls out “unique Stockholm data magically transformed into an Iraq case study, courtesy of 16 authors from six different countries!” He also included the following picture of data presented in the two papers:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The left image is from Sadrizadeh’s paper, while the right is from the article in <em>Energy and Buildings</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lead author of the May study, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qusay-Hassan-2">Qusay Hassan</a>, is a researcher at the University of Diyala in Baqubah, Iraq. He did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>Jianlei Niu, the editor-in-chief of <em>Energy and Buildings,</em> saw Sadrizadeh’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ssad_kth-mdu-academicmisconduct-activity-7201577707405549569-vceW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">LinkedIn post</a> calling out the similarities in data and reached out to him, Sadrizadeh told Retraction Watch. The paper was later withdrawn. Niu forwarded our request for comment to the publisher’s ethics team, which did not respond to our emails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The withdrawal statement from the journal reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been withdrawn by the editor. The journal concluded that there were possible duplicates/manipulations in Figures 2, 5, 6, 11, 15, and 16 with the published article, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117420">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117420</a>.

<p>How well do databases flag retracted articles?</p>



<p>There has been a lot of interest recently in the quality of retraction notices and notifications, including <a href="https://www.niso.org/press-releases/niso-publishes-recommended-practice-communication-retractions-removals-and">new guidelines from the National Information Standards Organization</a> (NISO; our Ivan Oransky was a member of the committee) and a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/metrics/10.1080/08989621.2024.2366281?scroll=top">new study which Ivan and our Alison Abritis joined</a>.</p>



<p>In another new paper, &#8220;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2024.111427">Identification of Retracted Publications and Completeness of Retraction Notices in Public Health</a>,&#8221; a group of researchers set out to study &#8220;how clearly and consistently retracted publications in public health are being presented to researchers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: Not very.</p>



<p>We asked corresponding author Caitlin Bakker, of the University of Regina &#8212; who also chaired the NISO committee &#8212; some questions about the findings and their implications.</p>



<span id="more-129548"></span>



<p><strong>You looked at 441 retractions in the public health literature sourced from The Retraction Database in 2023. How often were these marked as retracted in various places researchers might look for the status of such papers?</strong></p>



<p>We searched for each of the 441 publications in 11 resources, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and other databases. We were able to find over 2800 records for these retracted publications in these different resources, of which less than 50% identified that the publication had been retracted. We also found that a publication being marked as retracted in one database didn’t mean it would be marked as retracted in other databases. Less than 5% of the publications were marked as retracted in every resource through which they were available.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What are the implications of your findings?</strong></p>



<p>As a librarian, one thing I care about very deeply is information literacy, which is a set of skills that enables a person to know when they have a knowledge gap and they need information, to be able to find that information, to access it, and to use it effectively to meet their needs and create new knowledge. For many years, I’ve taught students about the importance of using trusted, scholarly content, like peer reviewed articles and scholarly databases, and how to use those resources effectively to find the best available evidence to address their questions. I’ve always tried to reinforce to students why it’s important to think critically about where they’re finding information and who is producing and publishing that material, not only so that they can address a specific research question, but so they can be information literate. </p>



<p>But, all of those activities and skills rely on accurate information being provided through those resources, and unmarked retractions pose significant challenges to information literacy. If the fact that the retraction occurred isn’t discoverable, that’s an incredibly important piece of context that a reader doesn’t have when deciding if and how they want to use the publication. A reader who is unaware that an article has been retracted would be more likely to use that article in their research and practice, and perpetuate its misinformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What changes would you recommend for how authors check the status of papers they’re planning to cite? What changes should publishers consider making?</strong></p>



<p>There are tools that are available that can assist authors. Some libraries, including my own, have access to <a href="https://thirdiron.com/press-releases/third-iron-integrates-retraction-watch-data/">BrowZine and LibKey</a>, which alert readers to an article’s retracted status directly from the library’s search interface, so that authors know an article’s been retracted before they see the full text. Several citation managers, including <a href="https://support.clarivate.com/Endnote/s/article/EndNote-20-Retraction-Alerts?language=en_US">EndNote</a> and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/retracted-item-notifications/">Zotero</a>, also have functionality that will flag retracted articles, so if you happen to save a paper and it’s later retracted, you’ll still be alerted before you cite it. </p>



<p>However, despite these tools, there’s no one foolproof strategy authors can use that will always alert them to a retraction. Authors instead need to use a variety of strategies and tools, which can be a challenge, given that these are additional steps that need to be taken in the research and publication process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my opinion, there needs to be greater transparency and consistency with retraction-related metadata, both from the publishers and also through vendors such as aggregators. In our research, we found that even within a single database, there could be quite a lot of variety with regards to where and how an item was marked as retracted. On one paper, it may be in the title, while another it would be in the abstract, and another it would be in a completely different field. From an outsider’s perspective, it would appear that some databases may not have consistent policies about how, when and where they mark articles as retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retraction notices often refer to <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.1.4">COPE guidelines</a>, and publishers have at least tacitly agreed to uphold them by joining COPE. But you found that fewer than half of the retraction notices in the study met COPE requirements, and even fewer met <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/21/what-should-an-ideal-retraction-notice-look-like/">proposed Retraction Watch criteria</a>. Does that surprise you? And what, if anything, should be done about it?</strong></p>



<p>I was disappointed but not surprised by the number of notices that didn’t meet requirements. What I found particularly unfortunate was that no requirement was met by all notices. Even requirements that would appear to be relatively easy to meet, such as not paywalling the notice and identifying it as a retraction, still had a level of non-compliance. It’s difficult to say what should be done without knowing the reasons for non-compliance. It would be wonderful to hear from publishers what the barriers are to creating more robust notices. There have been some proposals, such as <a href="https://ease.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/EASE-Standard-Retraction-Form-2023.pdf">standardized forms for retractions</a> that would include all necessary fields, that could be very beneficial in creating more transparent, informative notices.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You note that the study only looked at a single point in time. Based on your previous <a href="https://www.iastatedigitalpress.com/jlsc/article/id/12798/">work</a> in this <a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/29/2/121">subject</a>, however, have you seen changes in behavior and practice?</strong></p>



<p>I began working in this area about eight years ago, and in some ways when purely looking at the problem from a search and discovery perspective, I wouldn’t say that I’ve seen meaningful improvement. However, what I have seen changing is the level of interest in tackling the issue. I’ve been especially pleased to see the enthusiasm for solutions that would cross the entire scholarly publishing industry, but also that bring in expertise from people in libraries, repositories, researchers and other related fields. This problem is not localized to any one database or discipline, and so the solutions can’t be localized to any one publisher or industry.</p>

                A hot ocean provides the energy hurricanes need to grow—and can limit the cooling that happens in their wake, making it likelier that the storms that follow will be powerful ones.

                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Emil Dmitruk will talk about his work in the presentation entitled &quot;Topological Data Analysis Reveals Brain Connectivity Differences between Schizophrenia Subjects and Healthy Controls&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The aim of this study is to reveal structural connectivity patterns prevalent across a
large population and whether any of these patterns differ between schizophrenia subjects
(SCH) and healthy controls (HC). We use topological data analysis methods, namely
persistent homology using the weight rank clique filtration on brain connectivity matrices
obtained from a probabilistic fibre-tracking algorithm run on the Centre for Biomedical
Research Excellence (COBRE) dataset (N = 44 SCH, N = 44 HC) to investigate group
differences. We show that some of the connectivity structures differ in strength relative
to connectivity structures affecting other brain regions. These differences would not have
been apparent using traditional methods that explore only the absolute strength of
connectivity between regions. We show that many connectivity structures (cycles) are
shared among numerous subjects and some of the cycles are significantly different between
the two studied populations- both on a whole brain level (all cycles combined), and also
at the level of individual cycle classes. Brain regions involved in cycles that were found
were mentioned in studies of brain alteration in schizophrenia, e.g. precuneus, motor,
visual, and parietal cortices (the last being tied to experiences of psychosis). We show
that HC and SCH subjects share a lot in their structural connectome and the effect of
schizophrenia is an alteration in the relative strength, as measured by topological
persistence, of various white matter connectivity structures. We believe that further
studies could lead to prognostication for individual patients and be the first step to
developing personalised treatment.</p>

                <p class="has-text-align-left">by Laura Luebbert and Lior Pachter</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong> (by LL)</p>



<p>Four years ago, during the first year of my PhD at Caltech, I participated in a journal club organized by the lab I was rotating in. I was assigned two classic papers on the honeybee waggle dance: “Visually Mediated Odometry in Honeybees”&nbsp; (Srinivasan <em>et al.</em>, <em>JEB</em> 1997)<a href="https://paperpile.com/c/U1rAov/ZMuK"><sup>1</sup></a> and “Honeybee Navigation: Nature and Calibration of the ‘Odometer’” (Srinivasan <em>et al.</em>, <em>Science</em> 2000)<a href="https://paperpile.com/c/U1rAov/2NFu"><sup>2</sup></a>. Since I was not familiar with honeybee behavior, I decided to expand my literature review to other papers on the topic, including “Honeybee Navigation En Route to the Goal: Visual Flight Control and Odometry”&nbsp; (Srinivasan <em>et al.</em>, <em>JEB</em> 1996)<a href="https://paperpile.com/c/U1rAov/Lzqm"><sup>3</sup></a> and “How honeybees make grazing landings on flat surfaces” (Srinivasan <em>et al.</em>, <em>Biological Cybernetics</em> 2000)<a href="https://paperpile.com/c/U1rAov/JBKp"><sup>4</sup></a>. While reading these papers, I sensed something strange; I had the feeling that I was looking at the same data over and over again.</p>



<p>I decided to examine the figures and results in the papers carefully, and upon further examination,&nbsp; I found inconsistencies in the results and instances of identical data being reported for different experiments in distinct papers. I was deeply concerned by these findings and presented them at the journal club meeting using animations and overlays to show that the data was indeed identical; the original slides from my journal club presentation on April 9, 2020 are shown below for one example of identical data reported for different experimental conditions and replicate numbers in (Srinivasan <em>et al.</em>, <em>JEB</em> 1997)<a href="https://paperpile.com/c/U1rAov/ZMuK"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcAWHkESYOLdSvY060GBx7zir9twmhJjmTb6KsyuSWv8vR0sCveCsypRF3laF6_S1gntnKBQ6ZHyrnNUcj6Bogy6pk2EGueB-QLH2UdGltRQWd92C4k5n-rOffdfyPGubFSX1VlC9RSTqepCWO6JtKRcx7D?key=glnzs_9fKF3ZADfbqXEFng" width="319" height="622"></p>



<p>I had imagined that the response to my presentation would be concern and advice on how to report my findings. Instead, both within and outside of Caltech, the response amounted to little more than a collective shrug.</p>



<p>My rotation advisor, a tenured professor, told me that they did not know what to do, so I turned to the instructor of a class I had just finished on “Responsible Conduct of Research”—a required class for first-year PhD students at Caltech. They told me that “it is a question of how you want to spend your time” and “a lot of the scientific literature has problems [&#8230;], science is an imperfect process”. What was an aspiring scientist supposed to take away from this? I had assumed that ensuring scientific integrity would be a top priority for scientists, not an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, on May 28, 2020, <a href="https://x.com/NeuroLuebbert/status/1266162740218888192">I took my frustrations to Twitter</a>, hoping that someone would follow up on my discovery. After help from Dr. Elisabeth Bik, I ended up posting two PubPeer articles, available <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F639C63BF2C4AC4328070EEDA5857B">here</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9FE2AA69C8521CFEA14E453801350B">here</a>. However, both posts have been ignored by journal editors and authors for the past four years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was thinking about the collective silence that afflicts scientists when uncomfortable allegations of misconduct are brought forth when, earlier this year, Bill Ackman’s plagiarism accusations against Prof. Claudine Gay were seized upon not only by academics but the public at large. Why is it that accusations of misconduct against men are routinely dismissed as inconsequential while a high-standing female academic missing citations for sub-sentences in the methods and<em> acknowledgments</em> of her PhD thesis is worthy of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/us/harvard-claudine-gay-plagiarism.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times article</a>?</p>



<p>As I regained some faith in scientific integrity, I decided to revisit the honeybee waggle dance papers, and I ended up writing a detailed report in collaboration with my advisor, Lior Pachter. The report, titled “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The miscalibration of the honeybee odometer</a>&#8221; is now posted on the arXiv. We discuss its implications below.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>The miscalibration of the honeybee odometer </strong>(by LL and LP)<br></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">After reading several papers on honeybee navigation coauthored by Srinivasan, we determined that there were numerous instances of apparent misconduct in addition to the cases of data duplication first presented by Laura in the journal club four years ago. In our report, we discuss numerous papers published over the course of a decade, that are part of the foundation of the field of honeybee behavior, and continue to be cited today. We provide clear evidence that several of these papers contained erroneous information, and many of them contain duplicated and manipulated data. Importantly, the report became a critique not of a single paper, but of a large body of work. We decided it was of the utmost importance for researchers working on honeybee navigation to learn that classic experiments on which the field was based ought to be repeated to verify that the claims made are correct. However, we soon found that there was no medium to publish our manuscript.</p>



<p>We started with bioRxiv, which promptly rejected the manuscript on screening, telling us that we should “reformat it as a research paper presenting new results along with appropriate methods used, rather than <em>simply a critique of existing literature.” </em>Moreover, we were told that our manuscript contained “content with ad hominem attacks,” even though it was merely a factual report of the issues we observed with appropriate citations of the affected papers, with no attack on any people or specific persons.</p>



<p>Faced with rejection from bioRxiv, we decided to submit the manuscript to the Journal of Experimental Biology (JEB), which had published several of the problematic papers. JEB rejected our manuscript for publication but told us they were “investigating the issues raised.” They also said that they “can only investigate issues on papers published in our journals, so you will also need to contact individually each of the other journals that published the papers with which <em>you</em> have concerns.” (Note the use of the word “<em>you</em>&#8220;, which we interpreted as an abdication of responsibility by the journal to ensure scientific integrity at large.)  Again, we found ourselves without a venue in which to describe problematic results <em>across several papers</em>. We also felt that contacting individual journals for corrections would not serve the community well. Our point was about an entire body of work, not nitpicks regarding individual articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of reporting the problems at large across papers is exemplified by the Expressions of Concern published by JEB on June 25, 2024, in response to our manuscript submission to their journal, which can be found <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/227/12/jeb248085/358103/Expression-of-Concern-Visually-mediated-odometry">here</a> and <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/227/12/jeb248084/358102/Expression-of-Concern-Honeybee-navigation-en-route">here</a>. In their Expressions of Concern, JEB states that “the 1996 paper is <em>likely</em> to contain the correct values of the width of the narrow tunnel (11 cm)”, “It <em>appears</em> that Fig. 7 does not contain the correct graph for the searching distribution with the landmark positioned at Unit 9,” and “M. V. Srinivasan <em>believes</em> that the length of the tunnel was not 3.35 m as reported in the 1996 paper, but 3.20 m as indicated in Srinivasan et al. (1997).” Readers are supposed to rest assured that these “issues do not alter the overall results and conclusions of the paper.” We were surprised that the bar for publication at JEB is &#8220;belief&#8221; and that results are only &#8220;likely&#8221; to be correct.</p>



<p>Perhaps, if the issues in the two JEB papers were the only issues with this body of work, one could excuse them as human error—which should still cast doubt on the conclusions of the paper. However, JEB was made aware of the issues with this body of work at large, which includes many more instances of data duplication and apparent manipulation across a total of six papers (as far as we found), yet JEB still decided to dismiss their occurrence in their papers. JEB stated in their Expressions of Concern that they “are publishing this Expression of Concern to <em>make readers aware of the issues</em> and our <em>efforts to resolve them,</em>” though no such efforts are described in either Expression, and readers are misled by JEB&#8217;s failure to mention that these are not isolated instances pertaining only to the two papers in question. We found the response from “the leading primary research journal in comparative physiology” to be disappointing.</p>



<p>We finally submitted our manuscript to the arXiv, where it was published after being placed on hold for two weeks without any explanation. All of our findings regarding the scientific misconduct in honeybee papers are described in detail here<a href="https://paperpile.com/c/U1rAov/SRXY"><sup>5</sup></a>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12998">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12998</a> Notably, JEB failed to cite our arXiv manuscript in their Expressions of Concern (our manuscript appeared on May 8, 2024—over a month before their Expressions) and instead mentions only the limited PubPeer articles from 2020, which they had ignored for four years. </p>



<p>Leaving aside the specifics of honeybee, our experience with correcting the literature made us realize that there seems to be no venue right now for critiquing a body of work by an author. Comments on PubPeer are  great; and corrections or retractions in journals are useful, but neither serve to alert a community to problematic behavior across numerous articles by an author. We think that our paper would have benefitted from peer review and a mechanism for commentary. For the latter, we decided to write this blog post. For the former, we suggest a Journal of Scientific Integrity.</p>

                <p><em>Written by Marcel LaFlamme</em></p>



<p>With the latest release of the <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686/7">PLOS Open Science Indicators (OSI) results</a>, we are introducing a new indicator for study registration&mdash;also known as <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/">preregistration</a>. The results from this preliminary version of the indicator show that adoption is lower than for other indicators but is growing, albeit slowly. Over time, more researchers may be discovering how registering and publicly sharing a study design before results are known can <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/8/1/36306/185533/The-Effect-of-Preregistration-and-P-Value-Patterns">enhance trust in their work</a>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This release also provides a first look at Open Science practices for articles published in 2024, bringing the results for data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting up to date through the first quarter of this year. The complete dataset, which extends back to 2018 and now comprises 135,214 articles, is as always freely available to access and reuse.</p>

<p><strong>Developing the new indicator</strong></p>



<p>Study registration <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001949">has been identified</a> as a priority Open Science practice to monitor in biomedical research. It is also an indicator of interest for the <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/open-research-indicators/">pilots being </a><a href="https://www.ukrn.org/open-research-indicators/">organized</a><a href="https://www.ukrn.org/open-research-indicators/"> by the UK Reproducibility Network</a>, in which PLOS and our partner <a href="https://dataseer.ai">DataSeer</a> are participating. For the purposes of OSI, we defined study registration as &ldquo;the plan for a research study, including research questions/ hypotheses, details about the research design, and/ or plans for data analysis, which has been made available for public sharing in order to ensure unbiased reporting and support the differentiation of planned and unplanned research directions.&rdquo;</p>



<p>From there, we worked to develop an approach to measuring study registration in the published scientific literature. We initially focused on detecting references to registries that record structured information about a study&rsquo;s design, including clinical trial registries, systematic review registries, animal study registries, and other general purpose registries like the Open Science Framework. We then matched persistent identifiers and other links with the corresponding registries.</p>



<p>To our knowledge, this approach&mdash;covering more than 30 registries&mdash;is the most comprehensive one that&rsquo;s been developed and implemented at scale. But, because it relies on a predefined allowlist of registries (see the study registration indicator&rsquo;s <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686/7">methods statement</a> for more information), it&rsquo;s possible that there are registries we missed. If you have any feedback on the approach we&rsquo;ve taken, please let us know at mlaflamme [at] plos.org.<br><strong><br>How common is study registration?</strong></p>



<p>Over the past five years, study registration rates at PLOS have risen slowly but steadily, from 5% of articles in 2018 to 7% in 2023. The same overall trendline can be observed in the comparator corpus, with rates rising from 6% in 2018 to 7% in 2023.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="624" height="373" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Study-registration-rates.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22406" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Study-registration-rates.png 624w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Study-registration-rates-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure>



<p><strong><em>Figure 1. </em></strong><em>Study registration rates for PLOS and comparator content by publication quarter, 2018-2023.</em></p>



<p>The most commonly used registry by PLOS authors is Clinicaltrials.gov, followed by the systematic review registry PROSPERO. But the prevalence of registrations using the Open Science Framework and other registries, covering a wide variety of study designs, can also be observed for the first time with this new indicator. The data being released are currently not optimized for segmenting by discipline, although <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686/3">a previous version of the OSI dataset</a> does include fields of research for most of the relevant articles and we plan to share an analysis of the study registration data by field later this year. Other features we are considering for this indicator include detecting registrations in the text of supplementary files and capturing the dates when registrations were recorded and shared. But what else would make the indicator more useful? Again, we&rsquo;d be grateful for your input.</p>



<p><strong><br>Other results and refinements</strong></p>



<p>The main data files in the latest OSI dataset include all 112,229 PLOS research articles published between 1 January 2018 and 31 March 2024, as well as a smaller comparator corpus. For PLOS articles the latest results show:</p>



<ul>
<li>31% of all research articles shared research date in a repository in Q1 2024 (no change from Q4 2023)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>17% of all research articles shared code in Q1 2024 (up 1% from Q4 2023)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>22% of all research articles were associated with a preprint in Q1 2024 (down 2% from Q4 2023)</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="624" height="376" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Data-sharing-in-a-repository.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22407" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Data-sharing-in-a-repository.png 624w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Data-sharing-in-a-repository-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></figure>



<p><strong><em>Figure 2.</em></strong><em> Data sharing in a repository, code sharing, and preprint posting for PLOS and comparator content by publication quarter, 2018-Q1 2024.</em></p>



<p>The rate of preprint adoption at comparators <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/03/six-years-of-open-science-indicators-data/">has been higher than at PLOS since 2023</a>, driven by publishers with in-house preprint servers, but this rate also dropped in comparators in Q1 2024, suggesting a wider trend. Meanwhile, improvements have been applied to the preprint indicator and applied retrospectively to the entire corpus. A minor source of false positives has been removed and, more significantly, preprints posted after the associated research article was published (also known as &ldquo;postprints&rdquo;) have been eliminated. This change disproportionately affects older articles, which have had longer to accumulate a postprint. See the updated <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686/7">methods statement</a> in the main documentation for more information.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve also updated our comparator article matching approach. For this latest version, the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html">Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms</a> for the new quarter of data have been updated based on the distribution of MeSH terms for PLOS articles published between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2023. We expect to update the MeSH term distribution yearly to ensure that the comparator sample remains comparable to the changing composition of PLOS articles.</p>

<p>The articles in the guest-edited issue, <em>Prescriptive Analytics Using Machine Learning and Mathematical Programming for Sustainable Operations Research, </em>were published between June 2022 and October 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129532"></span>



<p>A landing page for the issue doesn’t appear on the journal’s website because the concerns came before the special issue was completed, a representative from Springer told us in an email. They didn’t provide information on how these concerns came to light or the specifics of the investigation’s findings, saying the investigation is still ongoing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guest editor, <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/people/staff/amardani">Abbas Mardani</a>, is a researcher at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. He was named in the top 1% of Highly Cited Researchers in 2021 and 2022 in <a href="https://recognition.webofscience.com/awards/highly-cited/2021/">Clarivate’s Web of Science</a>. Several of his papers have <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Abbas+Mardani">comments on PubPeer</a> questioning the theorems. Mardani did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://harrisburg.psu.edu/faculty-and-staff/angappa-gunasekaran-phd">Angappa Gunasekaran</a>, a researcher at Penn State Harrisburg in Dauphin County, and a co-author of one of the retracted papers, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-023-05251-3">Prescriptive analytics applications in sustainable operations research: conceptual framework and future research challenges</a>,” called the retraction a “social taboo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>His colleague, Deepa Bhatt Mishra, disagreed with the retraction, according to the notice. “I fully support Dr. Deepa Bhatt Mishra and my other co-authors in placing the blame on the publisher,” Gunasekaran told us in an email. He denied having any connection to Mardani prior to submitting the article.</p>



<p>Gunasekaran said his research group submitted a draft to the call for papers posted on the website of <em>Annals of Operations Research</em>.&nbsp; They expected “the individual responsible for editing the special issue is a respected scholar in their field.” He continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It is not the responsibility of the authors to know how the papers are processed, or the circumstances under which decisions are made. All we know is that our submission underwent more than two rounds of rigorous revisions and took quite some time. Unfortunately, we received a retraction email from the publisher that lacked clarity and transparency, and in the end, we authors paid a heavy price for the irresponsible actions of Guest Editor, the EIC of the journal, and the publisher.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last July, the journal <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10479/volumes-and-issues/326-1/supplement?filter-by-volume=326&amp;page=1">retracted 81 papers from another special issue</a>, using the same notice as the recent retractions. “These papers comprise the one other special issue in the journal that the Springer Nature Research Integrity unit identified as part of their ongoing investigations work,” a spokesperson for the publisher said. “We are committed to ensuring the integrity of the publication record and these retractions reflect our ongoing work in that regard.”</p>

<p>A panel of scholars in Finland has downgraded 60 journals in their quality rating system, following months of review and feedback from researchers.</p>



<p>The Finnish Publication Forum (JUFO) classifies and rates journals and other scholarly publications to “support the quality assessment of academic research,” according to its website. JUFO considers the level of transparency, the number of experts on a publication’s editorial board, and the standard of peer review to make its assessment, which academics can use to determine the credibility of a given title or its publisher.</p>



<p>JUFO’s classification ranges from 3, for “supreme-level” publications, to 1, which still counts as legitimate publication. <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/faq-0#Q5">Level 0</a> means the journal is excluded from the ranking, which may dissuade researchers from publishing with them, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/can-you-explain-what-these-1500-papers-are-doing-in-this-journal/">James Heathers</a>, a scientific sleuth said. Finland’s university funding model relies on JUFO as a publication quality metric.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129519"></span>



<p>In February, JUFO posted an <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/jufo-collects-experiences-defects-quality-assessment-practices-scientific-journals">open call</a> asking for negative experiences to help re-evaluate&nbsp; the ranking system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heathers and <a href="https://www.jyu.fi/en/people/veli-matti-karhulahti">Veli-Matti Karhulahti</a>, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Jyväskylä, gathered roughly 200 different publication-related experiences from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mkarhulahti.bsky.social/post/3kndn377upk2z">BlueSky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/jamesheathers/status/1768268321323946064">X</a> users and submitted them to JUFO.</p>



<p>The 60 <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XL6WpwztflELASTDu0TqdJP5XenY9YrGi6vXOZ3Gea8/edit?gid=0#gid=0">journals</a> will be downgraded from level 1 to level 0 at the start of 2025. Of these, 21 are from MDPI, three from Wiley, and three from Frontiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/02/exclusive-mdpi-journal-undergoing-reevaluation-at-scopus-indexing-on-hold/">JUFO downgraded MDPI’s</a> <em>Sustainability</em> to level 0 over doubts about the journal’s “procedures to ensure scientific quality work reliably,” as we reported. At JUFO’s June meeting, the group discussed the possibility of downgrading all MDPI journals to level 0 but did not take any action on the idea. MDPI did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Tom Ciavarella, head of public affairs for Frontiers North America, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Finland and Frontiers established <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2022/04/07/finland-and-frontiers-establish-national-open-access-agreement/">a national Open Access agreement</a> in 2022 and enjoy a strong collaborative relationship. We have been made aware of the recent decision by JUFO to list three Frontiers journals &#8212; Frontiers in Plant Science, Frontiers in Marine Science, and Frontiers in Sociology &#8212; at level 0 starting January 1, 2025. Frontiers is seeking information from JUFO about its decision. JUFO did not communicate any concerns to Frontiers about these journals prior to their change in status. These are journals that have strong support in the respective research communities, including in Finland.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Wiley has been transparent about our commitment to cleaning the scholarly record, investing in research integrity, and strengthening publishing processes. These journals continue to serve their communities,” a spokesperson for Wiley said.</p>



<p>Heathers’ X post which gained the most traction specifically asked for experiences with MDPI, Hindawi and Frontiers, Karhulahti said, which isn’t entirely representative of all publisher experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking about the submissions they received, Heathers said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Many of these journals were making unreasonable demands of their reviewers, or rejecting their opinion entirely, providing slipshod review processes, are run by dismissive, disinterested or just completely bent editors, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heathers and Karhulahti also submitted reports of good practice by journals to JUFO, he said.</p>



<p>“We recognise about half the journals from the submissions we made, so it&#8217;s likely that we provided a lot of the raw fuel that underpinned those downgrades,” Heathers told Retraction Watch. A spokesperson for JUFO declined to comment on individuals who gave feedback.</p>



<p>Although the campaign has ended, the scientific community can give JUFO feedback on the quality of publications at any time, a spokesperson for JUFO said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karhulahti urged more countries to stop relying on publisher-generated metrics of quality such as indexing in Scopus and instead use researcher or community-produced indexes, like JUFO.</p>



<p>“All in all, a very successful experiment,” Heathers said, “and one we would happily repeat.”</p>



<p>Update, 1930 UTC, 7/1/24: MDPI are “deeply disappointed to see 20 MDPI journals moved from Level 1 to Level 0, especially without proper explanation or reasoning,” said Rui Duarte, the public relations manager for MDPI.  Despite this, Duarte said, the company wants to assure Finnish authors that they can continue to publish with MDPI with confidence, as they have 274 journals included in Level 1.</p>



<p>“While we are perplexed by JUFO&#8217;s decisions, we understand that the evaluation of journals is part of the process. We will make efforts to establish open communication with JUFO to better understand their decisions, educate them about MDPI and our editorial process, and clarify any misunderstandings or concerns they may have,” he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/the-impact-of-exercise-on-mental-health-a-neuroscientific-perspective">The Impact of Exercise on Mental Health: A Neuroscientific Perspective</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;">Mental Health Awareness Week, observed in mid-May, highlights the ongoing importance of addressing mental health issues. As we move into July and enjoy better weather, the seasonal depression that affects many during the winter months often lifts. However, it&apos;s important to remember that mental health issues do not simply disappear with the arrival of summer. Among the many factors that influence mental health, exercise stands out due to its significant and well-documented benefits. This blog explores the neuroscience behind how physical activity can enhance mental well-being, providing insights into the mechanisms that make exercise a potent tool for mental health improvement.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Exercise as a Primary Treatment for Depression</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A comprehensive study conducted by researchers at the University of South Australia has emphasised the potential of exercise as a primary treatment for depression. Published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, this meta-review is the most extensive to date, analysing data from 97 reviews, encompassing 1,039 trials and 128,119 participants. The findings are striking: physical activity is 1.5 times more effective than traditional treatments, such as counselling or leading medications, in alleviating symptoms of depression. </p>
<p>The meta-review reveals that short-term exercise interventions, lasting 12 weeks or less, are particularly effective. This highlights the rapid impact physical activity can have on mental health, offering a promising alternative or complement to conventional treatments. Notably, substantial benefits were observed in diverse groups, including individuals with depression, pregnant and postpartum women, healthy individuals, and those diagnosed with HIV or kidney disease. This suggests that exercise can be beneficial across a wide range of demographics and health conditions. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Types and Intensity of Exercise</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The type and intensity of exercise play crucial roles in its effectiveness. This study found that all forms of physical activity—ranging from aerobic exercises and resistance training, to mixed-mode exercise and yoga—were effective in improving mental health. However, moderate-to-high-intensity exercise was more effective than low-intensity exercise, likely due to the greater physiological and neurochemical changes induced by higher-intensity workouts. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Another systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Noetel et al. in 2024 corroborates these findings. This analysis examined the impact of various exercise modalities on depression and found that walking, jogging, yoga, strength training, and dancing significantly alleviate depressive symptoms. Interestingly, the review highlighted differences in effectiveness based on gender and age. For instance, walking and jogging benefited both genders, whereas strength training was more effective for women, and yoga or qigong was particularly effective for men. Additionally, yoga showed greater benefits for older adults, while strength training was more beneficial for younger individuals. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Neurological Mechanisms</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Understanding the neurological mechanisms behind the mental health benefits of exercise is essential. The University of South Australia study points to several key neurobiological changes induced by physical activity. Exercise boosts the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), enhances the availability of serotonin and norepinephrine, regulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and reduces systemic inflammation. These changes contribute to improved mood and reduced anxiety, supporting the therapeutic benefits of physical activity. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Noetel et al. also propose several mechanisms based on trends observed in their data. They suggest that social interaction in group exercises can enhance social connectivity, reducing feelings of isolation and depression. Practices like yoga promote mindfulness and experiential acceptance, which are beneficial for mental health. Activities with immediate feedback, such as strength training, can boost self-confidence and perceived competence. Furthermore, exposure to green spaces during outdoor activities provides additional environmental and psychological benefits. Collectively, these factors contribute to the mental health benefits associated with exercise. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Implications for Mental Health Treatment</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Despite the strong evidence supporting the benefits of exercise, it remains underutilised in clinical practice for several reasons. Patients may be reluctant to adopt exercise routines, particularly if they are experiencing severe depressive symptoms. Additionally, prescribing and monitoring exercise can be challenging in clinical settings, and there is a lack of standardised protocols for integrating exercise into mental health treatment plans. </p>
<p>Clinical guidelines also vary across countries. While some, like Australia, recommend lifestyle management, including exercise, as a first-line treatment, others view it as a complementary approach when psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is ineffective. The meta-analysis by Noetel et al. advocates for the integration of exercise into primary treatment protocols for depression, tailored to individual patient characteristics. They propose that structured programs and group exercises can provide additional support and enhance adherence, leading to better outcomes. Exercise should be recommended as a primary treatment for depression, rather than merely as a supplementary option. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #1d1c1d;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h4>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d1c1d;">The evidence strongly supports the incorporation of physical activity as a primary treatment for depression and anxiety. Both studies highlight the significant mental health benefits, lower costs, and fewer side effects of exercise compared to traditional treatments. Given these advantages, exercise should be more widely adopted in therapeutic settings. Future research should focus on optimising exercise prescriptions and integrating physical activity into standard mental health care practices to enhance patient outcomes.</span></p>
