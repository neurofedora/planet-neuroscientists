<p>A former researcher at Nemours Children‚Äôs Health in Wilmington, Del., admitted to falsifying and incorrectly reporting data in at least two published studies, both of which were supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health. The studies have been retracted.</p>



<p>The researcher, Valerie Sampson, reported herself to Nemours, which launched an inquiry into all of her publications, according to a hospital spokesperson. The institution‚Äôs findings are under review at the U.S. Office of Research Integrity.</p>



<p>Sampson left Nemours in January 2022 after 16 years with the hospital, according to her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerie-sampson-b10210221/">LinkedIn profile</a>. She also held a position as an affiliated scientist at the University of Delaware, a role that ended in the same month, per the profile. Six months following her departure from Nemours, Sampson took a position as a scientist at WuXi Advanced Therapies in Philadelphia, a company specializing in cell and gene therapies, for a little over a year. She is currently unemployed, according to the profile.¬†</p>



<span id="more-130469"></span>



<p>None of her papers seem to have been flagged on PubPeer, besides comments sharing the text of the retraction notices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sampson describes herself as a ‚ÄúMeticulous and analytical Researcher‚Äù with more than 15 years of experience in ‚Äúcancer research, Research Compliance and Safety.‚Äù We tried to reach Sampson on LinkedIn and at an email address listed in an online directory but got no response. Her institutional email is no longer active.¬†</p>



<p>One of the retracted papers, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666350320300237">Neointimal hyperplasia after carotid transection and anastomosis surgery is associated with degradation of decorin and platelet-derived growth factor signaling</a>,‚Äù appeared in <em>JVS-Vascular Science</em> in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the retraction <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666350324000270">notice</a> posted in October, Sampson contacted the journal and ‚Äúadmitted to manipulating samples and incorrectly reporting of data [sic]‚Äù to produce ‚Äúthe desired result.‚Äù Her co-authors were unaware of her actions, according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other retracted paper, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/13358/text/">Integrating mechanisms of response and resistance against the tubulin binding agent Eribulin in preclinical models of osteosarcoma</a>,‚Äù appeared in <em>Oncotarget</em> in 2016. It was cited 19 times before it was retracted in October, according to Clarivate‚Äôs Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/28663/">retraction notice</a>, Sampson ‚Äúconfirmed there was incorrect reporting of data‚Äù for seven figures in the paper, including polymerase chain reaction experiments without template controls. The notice also included a statement attributed to Sampson in which she accepted ‚Äúsole responsibility for the errors and the incorrect reporting of data.‚Äù</p>



<p>Kathryn Skeen, a media representative from Nemours, told Retraction Watch Sampson had ‚Äúself-disclosed‚Äù her misconduct to the institution. Following the admission, Nemours launched an investigation into all of Sampson‚Äôs published work. During the review, Nemours identified ‚Äúpotential concerns‚Äù in several other papers where Sampson is listed as an author, Skeen told us. The institution then notified the journals involved, and those journals have initiated their own investigations into the validity of the research, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skeen declined to share the details about Nemours‚Äô internal investigation, writing that ORI is reviewing the case.</p>

<p>After we reported on a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">new scam</a> to publish papers on webpages remarkably similar to those of Elsevier, Springer, the American Medical Association and other major publishers, the company linked to the clones denied any role in producing the content they contain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until we reached out for comment, the company ‚Äú<a href="https://www.springergloballtd.com/">Springer Global Publication</a>‚Äù ‚Äì which is not affiliated with Springer Nature ‚Äì had advertised a variety of services on its website, including finding a writer for research papers, editing manuscripts, developing research proposals, analyzing data and managing the peer review process, a collection of services which is a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">classic attribute of a paper mill</a>. After we emailed them, they removed descriptions of these services from their website, as well as links to papers published in cloned journals, but did not respond before publication of our story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After our story appeared, we received an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SGP-response.pdf">email</a> signed by ‚ÄúAdministrator &#8211; Springergloballtd.com,‚Äù in which the company said it did not ‚Äúcreate, review, or manage the content associated with the identifiers we issue.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company stated:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130466"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We would like to emphasize that our organization is not a publisher, nor do we operate any journals, cloned or otherwise. Our primary role is to provide Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) as a form of online identification for assignments, research papers, and various other digital content at the request of our customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>‚ÄúOur responsibility begins and ends with providing identifiers for submitted content, and we do not evaluate, verify, or publish the content ourselves,‚Äù the statement continued. ‚ÄúOur clients are responsible for the content they submit and its intended use.‚Äù</p>



<p>On a page still available on <a href="https://springergloballtd.com/publication.html">Springer Global&#8217;s website</a>, and archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241123143541/https://springergloballtd.com/publication.html">here</a>, the company lists 16 journals as ‚ÄúOur Publication [sic],‚Äù including ‚Äú<a href="https://springergloballtd.com/JAMA%20Opthalmology.html"><em>JAMA Ophthalmology</em></a>‚Äù and several others with titles matching journals from major publishers. The journal pages link to webpages for <a href="https://jamanetwork.international/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/97106/">articles</a> closely resembling the websites of the original publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúWhile we acknowledge that some submissions may contain journal names or designs that resemble those of established publishers, it is important to note that our role does not extend to verifying the authenticity of submitted content,‚Äù the company told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company also stated it does not ‚Äúcreate, host, or manage the webpages associated with the identifiers.‚Äù These pages are ‚Äúprovided to us by our clients, who assume full responsibility for their content and appearance,‚Äù it claimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company asked for us to share ‚Äúspecific cases or evidence that indicate misuse of our services.‚Äù We provided a list of DOIs published in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/25/exclusive-new-hijacking-scam-targets-elsevier-springer-nature-and-other-major-publishers/">our story</a>, and asked if they would take any action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another email signed by the ‚ÄúAdministrator,‚Äù the company replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As a relatively new entity in this domain, this situation has been a significant learning experience for us. Through your findings and our subsequent investigations, we have recognized that there were indeed issues that require our immediate attention and corrective action.</p>



<p>‚Ä¶</p>



<p>We are prepared to take any steps necessary to resolve this matter, including the review and possible retraction or correction of any problematic DOIs.</p>

<p>Until recently, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0">journal hijackers</a> do not appear to have targeted titles from big publishers, in part because their well-known website designs made such clones easy to detect.</p>



<p>Typically, cloned versions of journals‚Äô websites are of low quality and don‚Äôt resemble the recognizable and professional designs of Springer Nature and Elsevier. As described in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/author/anna-abalkina/">previous posts</a>, fraudulent publishers <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04056-0">would usually</a> copy the ISSN, title and other metadata of niche and university journals in order to avoid identification, and possibly index their unauthorized content in bibliographic databases such as <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24855">Scopus</a> or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/05/26/three-journals-web-domains-expired-then-major-indexes-pointed-to-hijacked-versions/">Web of Science</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We‚Äôve cataloged over 300 such cloned journals in the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, a small number of which involve major publishers like Springer Nature, Elsevier and Wiley. For example, earlier this year the <a href="https://x.com/AbalkinaAnna/status/1818936073306722568"><em>Journal of Academic Ethics</em></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240103081741/https://machineintelligenceresearch.com/"><em>Machine Intelligence Research</em></a>, both published by Springer Nature, were cloned.</p>



<p>But earlier this month, William Black, founder and CEO of<a href="https://www.psiref.com/"> PSIref</a>, an online platform aggregating scholarly publication data which offers advertising opportunities for publishers, sent me evidence of a new, more sophisticated scam.</p>



<span id="more-130458"></span>



<p>The company ‚Äú<a href="https://www.springergloballtd.com/">Springer Global Publication</a>‚Äù ‚Äì which is not affiliated with Springer Nature ‚Äì has published dozens of papers cloning the websites of journals officially published by Elsevier, Springer, the American Medical Association and more.&nbsp; The company had advertised a variety of services on its website, including finding a writer for research papers, editing manuscripts, developing research proposals, analyzing data and managing the peer review process. This collection of services is a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/01/hidden-hydras-uncovering-the-massive-footprint-of-one-paper-mills-operations/">classic attribute of a paper mill</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Global Publication did not respond to our request for comment, but after we contacted them, they removed descriptions of their services from their website, as well as links to papers published in cloned journals. (See an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/11/26/company-linked-to-cloned-journals-of-major-publishers-denies-cloning-journals-of-major-publishers/">update on this post</a>.)</p>



<p>The design of the websites for the cloned journals is strikingly similar to the original journals‚Äô websites, even with pop-ups about allowing cookies.</p>



<p>For example, the following screenshot is of a paper published in <em>Language Sciences</em>. However, the image comes not from an original website, but a cloned one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeA78GHYvceRspRZG0N5r9hVkhfb6eMi2EkyEpyQ3EkzKFiSY9SiFnt4BULQQsJJV9i0o_Kt__6aKrp88ZXRCVPeonLMHx14R34rOJ6zmPG3LdHhPziSVTYm3EIRDi3ev1Tfb7DFQ?key=y9U8plnqB39_u-BppyTEOjKk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The fake version can be identified from the domain name, which is sciencedirects.com, not sciencedirect.com, as in the original Elsevier website.</p>



<p>This screenshot comes from the original journal, for comparison.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcXRcL3uOVUBIFM1yqrQVDYwFx7o_dANCnSufT0NY-O8eoRVBeDWbQ7sfS-Rwn3UGAmtCnkme2gzSvD139yj6fPNtTAFq42qh--GS6N0zgoirl-OelarwW1ax6O-5dy-tZk4TUgoA?key=y9U8plnqB39_u-BppyTEOjKk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In another example, the following screenshot shows a paper published in <em>Educational Technology Research and Development</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeVr-wLCTOhBpLok_MNMZzVAoZ4lEx2cQhEuJT7Y-ISdQDEDequiPNBZlJVeGXSAaUtFX4APMLYf_PFDPJj6AyA5g8i9pxVpcbjUJLJ_E-i3GFWtjSS0c-mycyfiygdbw0cR4I_ZQ?key=y9U8plnqB39_u-BppyTEOjKk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The design of this webpage mimics that of the original Springer journal. The only detail revealing the scam is the domain name: springer.uk.com instead of the official springer.com<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The design of the original journal is identical.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeS1bVmobADEx05vOIbRAA20Rq-Wj2gepSnQ1OVtgArYDc3p_wpLZn5gTy7RkIdBL_mjFz0ITrfzuhGVgJNy9H4h0kvh4M5O0tbFw3_Ch7lOmZIynyWLzYxh8Dbbk2PfLhkVESQLQ?key=y9U8plnqB39_u-BppyTEOjKk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>All of the papers published by ‚ÄúSpringer Global Publications‚Äù are assigned DOIs with its own prefix 10.70706, which does not resemble the prefix of either Elsevier or Springer.</p>



<p>Overall, a search through Crossref identified 13 journals to which ‚ÄúSpringer Global Publications‚Äù has assigned DOIs. All of these journals have similar names to those established by legitimate publishers:</p>

<p>Ginny Hendricks of Crossref told us the organization would add the questionable DOIs to their list to ‚Äúinvestigate and take action.‚Äù [Editor‚Äôs note: Crossref <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/">acquired the Retraction Watch Database</a> last year and funds our efforts to maintain and update it.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>Representatives for Elsevier and Springer Nature both said the publishers take such issues seriously. ‚ÄúWe actively work through legal means to shut down fraudulent websites as soon as possible,‚Äù the Elsevier spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Nature previously took action to remove fraudulent websites cloning other journals, a spokesperson for the publisher said, and is ‚Äúcurrently investigating similar action to address these cases.‚Äù</p>



<p>Although this problematic publisher has registered only 13 journals with Crossref, this type of scam allows the publication of papers in an unlimited number of journals from legitimate publishers.</p>



<p>The website of ‚ÄúSpringer Global Publication‚Äù <a href="https://springergloballtd.com/publication.html">also lists</a> an additional three journals not registered with Crossref: <em>Springer Global Journal of Literature &amp; Linguistics</em>, <em>Springer Global Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences</em>, and <em>Springer Global Journal of Economics and Management.</em></p>



<p>The domain of this company was registered on Sept. 18, 2024. Two associated domains, springer.uk.com and sciencedirects.com, were registered on Nov. 11, and Sept. 18, 2024, respectively.</p>



<p>Papers published on the cloned websites appear to have content recycled from other sources. The company will most likely offer to publish papers in legitimate and reputable journals, but submitted papers will instead appear on cloned versions of the websites. This new scam represents high-quality fraudulent websites, with a remarkable resemblance to legitimate ones, capable of deceiving even experienced researchers. Be aware!</p>

                <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXckTRbb6Gc6ss4ekm1JQpFI2rHpBGRea0PDkXAuapQYf_f7CL_2GP3uS2lYCyPgYrBNvqSyN6ZKtx7nkaR-WrEi42KV42eMeh9HnB_leno6gS46rC-jnmJvxOTt-HGtD7Zu52VGU6HKoV5tChOU0Fw?key=g4tdTKt1p-CTT7FXvX-p-OT1" alt="A screenshot of Native Land Digital‚Äôs interactive map"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">via Smithsonian Magazine</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Smithsonian Magazine</em> has retracted a two-year-old article about an interactive online map describing indigenous lands in North America because the map ‚Äúdid not meet the standards of scholarship we expect of academic projects we cover as part of our editorial purview.‚Äù</p>



<p>The move followed sharp criticism from a pro-Israel group about a map produced by a nonprofit organization that formed the basis of the article.</p>



<p>The original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221013212829/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/interactive-map-shows-you-what-indigenous-land-you-live-on-180980920/">article</a>, published on Oct.13, 2022 and titled ‚ÄúThis Interactive Map Shows Which Indigenous Lands You Live On,‚Äù was based on a map created by <a href="https://native-land.ca/about/why-it-matters">Native Land</a>, a Canadian non-profit the article said ‚Äúis focused on improving both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people‚Äôs relationship with the lands around them.‚Äù The article encouraged readers to use the map in order to see which Indigenous communities resided in their city, state, or zip code.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130451"></span>



<p>The article included an image of the map for North America &#8212; see the image at the top of this post &#8212; and linked to Native Land‚Äôs website with a map of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to a request for comment, a magazine spokesperson <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Smithsonian-comment.pdf">told Retraction Watch</a>: &#8220;A number of readers reached out to the Smithsonian with their concerns about the Native Lands map, specifically about its treatment of Israel.‚Äù</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/interactive-map-shows-you-what-indigenous-land-you-live-on-180980920/">retraction note</a> on the article does not mention concerns about Israel, and a spokesperson said that would not change.</p>



<p>Native Land‚Äôs depiction of Israel on its <a href="https://native-land.ca/">website</a> first drew attention from ‚ÄúPens From Swords,‚Äù a pro-Israel WhatsApp activist group that organizes protests about anti-semitism and anti-Israel/-Zionism on social media and elsewhere online. It has been publicly aggressive in pressuring meeting venues to cancel meetings they consider Pro-Palestinian.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdT9c21YDcd3Ch2BAZtXjtz2j-6S3SCvs09r35SmZUxvJbQEF26pCZ4XHHlW3EDceQ_TFrLh2dcMbvx7-a8lwh7k60jbE50uFOXM3LT805MAjTHh4x4_1ztIUgyVd5t0jWM0ADDOx5DIahT3pDMeQ?key=g4tdTKt1p-CTT7FXvX-p-OT1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">via Pens From Swords</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Pens From Swords, the group‚Äôs members believe Native Lands had ‚Äúerased Israel‚Äù by placing ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù over the outline of the current borders of the Jewish state.</p>



<p>Native Land did not respond to a request for comment.¬†However, Aaron Carapella, an advisor to the group and owner of <a href="https://www.tribalnationsmaps.com/">Tribal Nations Maps</a>, criticized <em>Smithsonian</em>‚Äôs decision to retract the story. He told Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SmithsonianRetraction-Carapella-Quote.pdf">in an email</a> that he had not done any ‚Äúwork used by Native Land‚Äù for its online maps.</p>



<p>‚ÄúHowever, my own work has been a victim of cancel culture as well,‚Äù he said. &#8220;The notion that the Smithsonian would claim their [Native Land] work is not ‚Äòscholarly‚Äô is code for ‚Äòit wasn&#8217;t created by an academic from one our approved institutions.‚Äô&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.womeninneuroscienceuk.org/post/is-this-really-me-how-to-tackle-imposter-syndrome">Is this really me? How to tackle imposter syndrome!</a></h4>

              
                <p>Self-doubt, confusion and low self-esteem. Each of these are feelings you might experience when you believe you are not deserving of the position you are in today; you cannot rationalise your current reality and instead contribute your success to other factors, not your own hard work. This is more commonly known as imposter syndrome and is more prevalent in today‚Äôs society than ever before. Imposter syndrome can occur in any field, and at any level, but this article will refer to STEM careers and/or higher education.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a young woman, embarking upon my career within Neuroscience, and as the first individual within my family to pursue a STEM career, the emotions that imposter syndrome caused greatly impacted my journey, from before I entered university up until now as a postgraduate student. Imposter syndrome not only affected the way I viewed myself, but also altered the prospects I had for myself within my neuroscience career. So, how can we recognise and combat the feeling that we don‚Äôt deserve certain achievements or careers? In this article, I will be sharing my top three tips that I have learnt throughout my neuroscience career that you too can take on board, hopefully allowing you to recognise these self-critical thoughts and shift them into more uplifting ones.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Recognising that your thoughts towards your current situation are self-critical</strong></span></p>
<p>The initial step to defeating your imposter syndrome, particularly as a woman in STEM, is to recognise that the thoughts that are entering your head about your new job role or your position within a particular university or institution, for example, are self-deprecating and are not always healthy. Whilst this can be easier said than done, recognising these thoughts and feeling the consequent negative emotions, such as guilt or low mood, is an important first step in pinpointing that you are stuck in a certain perspective. Consider this scenario for example - you are taking part in a group discussion with your class at university and whilst waiting for your turn to speak, you are listening to your peers‚Äô ideas upon the chosen topic. One of your peers shares an excellent answer that, at the time, you feel is much better than yours. Subsequently, you begin to develop feelings of self-doubt and low self-esteem through believing that you do not share the same academic ability as your peers. And so, in this scenario, noticing that you are feeling such emotions instead of putting them to the side is the first step to defeating imposter syndrome and developing your confidence as a student or academic.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Shifting your self-critical thoughts into positive, uplifting ones</strong></span></p>
<p>One method that particularly worked for me to combat imposter syndrome throughout my neuroscience journey was taking small steps to help rewire my brain‚Äôs thought processes from self-critical thoughts to those that reinforce confidence and high self-esteem. Let‚Äôs take the previous scenario, for example, where thoughts of you not being clever enough or good enough to participate in this class flood your brain. To act upon this, we would first notice that these thoughts are caused by self-doubt. Instead of reinforcing negative beliefs and allowing this to become a natural thought pattern, we would actively combat these ideas with phrases such as ‚ÄòI am good enough‚Äô or ‚ÄòI am clever enough‚Äô. Whilst this may seem like a silly thing to do initially, it follows the same principle as affirmations, whereby you consistently reinforce positive, confident thoughts about a specific situation to slowly encourage your brain to understand that you truly are each of these positive things.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><span style="color: #A5698A;"><strong>3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Supporting your positive, uplifting thoughts with concrete facts</strong></span></p>
<p>Following my two previous tips on how to combat imposter syndrome, there still may be some lingering doubts in your brain that require additional support to help get rid of them. And so, whilst the repetition of positive affirmations does help to rewire your thinking, sometimes the addition of factual information can help solidify these shifts in your mindset. Again, using the scenario we have discussed throughout, it initially began with self-critical thoughts about how ‚Äôyou‚Äô may not feel as though ‚Äòyou‚Äô are good enough to be in that class and take part in such intellectual discussions. To prove that this is not true, we can reverse our thought processes by realising, ‚Äòif I wasn‚Äôt clever enough to be in this class, I wouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äô or ‚Äòif I wasn‚Äôt good enough to be in this university then, I wouldn‚Äôt have achieved the grades to be here or I wouldn‚Äôt have passed the interview stage.‚Äô By reinforcing our positive affirmations with facts, we disassociate ourselves from these feelings of self-doubt and move onto those of self-belief and confidence to enable us to achieve whatever we set our minds on.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I am an avid self-help podcast listener, and I have come across some great episodes where imposter syndrome is further discussed and some additional tips and tricks are shared that really helped me when these thoughts began to filter into my head, as a university student. </p>

<p>The first I would like to share is an episode from the podcast, <strong>‚ÄòA Millennial Mind‚Äô,</strong>¬†hosted by digital creator and speaker Shivani Pau with the addition of Bridgerton‚Äôs favourite, Charithra Chandran. Whilst this episode explores imposter syndrome from an actress‚Äôs point of view, the take home messages on how to combat such feelings are very similar.</p>

<p>The second podcast episode I would like to share is an episode from, <strong>‚ÄòThe Mel Robbins Podcast‚Äô,</strong>¬†whereby author Mel Robbins shares the most valuable piece of information to help silence the feelings of self-doubt that imposter syndrome brings about.</p>

<p>Ultimately, imposter syndrome is a huge issue, particularly among women working within STEM careers, but with the help of organisations such as WiNUK, there is a community of like-minded individuals who are embarking on their scientific careers. In these communities, open-ended discussions about topics such as imposter syndrome can be had and personal advice or tips on how to manage struggles can be shared! In addition to this, support services such as ‚Äò<strong>Student Space‚Äô led by the UK‚Äôs student mental health charity, Student Minds</strong>, can provide additional support and tailored services to students who are experiencing a range of mental health concerns, because of things like imposter syndrome, through a 24-hour text support line, free online workshops and support groups. I hope the advice and resources I have shared within this article, alongside sharing my own personal experiences surrounding imposter syndrome, have helped you to realise that you are not alone and that together, as today‚Äôs generation of scientists, we can combat imposter syndrome within the science community.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: Gender is a self-described characteristic, whilst sex is biologically determined. The term ‚Äòwomen‚Äô can refer to either or both definitions, and this may vary according to the study cited. At Women in Neuroscience UK, we tackle both sexism and gender biases in neuroscience, by covering topics of sex/gender discrimination in neuroscience workplaces and sex differences in neurological conditions. Our current activities primarily support female-identifying neuroscientists, but we actively encourage people of all gender identities to our community. We believe everyone can benefit from learning and peer support towards more diverse and inclusive neuroscience.</em></p>
