<p>A biotech company whose CEO faced allegations of manipulating data in papers used in NIH grant applications will pay a settlement of $4 million to resolve those allegations, the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/bothell-biopharmaceutical-company-pays-4-million-resolve-allegations-it-relied">announced</a> January 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement is the latest installment in a series of allegations surrounding research by Leen Kawas, the former CEO of the company, Bothell, Wash.-based Athira Pharma. In October 2021, four months after placing cofounder and then-CEO Kawas <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/17/athira-pharma-ceo-placed-on-leave-amid-allegations-of-altered-images-in-research-papers/">on leave</a>, an internal investigation found she falsified images in her doctoral dissertation and at least four research papers. </p>



<p>But concerns had been raised about the images as early as 2016, and Athira failed to report them, the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/bothell-biopharmaceutical-company-pays-4-million-resolve-allegations-it-relied">DOJ statement</a> noted. Those papers “were referenced in several grant applications submitted to NIH, including in a grant that NIH funded in 2019,” the statement continued.</p>



<span id="more-130665"></span>



<p>In September 2021, four papers in the <em>Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics </em><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/24/four-papers-by-athira-ceo-earn-expressions-of-concern/">earned expressions of concern</a> after they were flagged for possible image manipulation. (To date, none of these papers have been retracted, and have a combined 106 citations, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.)</p>



<p>In October of that year, <a href="https://investors.athira.com/news-releases/news-release-details/athira-pharma-announces-leadership-changes-mark-litton-phd-mba">Athira released</a> the results of its internal investigation, finding “that Dr. Kawas altered images in her 2011 doctoral dissertation and in at least four research papers that she co-authored while a graduate student at WSU, published from 2011 to 2014.”</p>



<p>At the time, Athira said Kawas’s research wasn’t the subject of its leading drug candidate or a patent application for it. However, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/21/athira-chief-executive-resigns-as-company-confirms-she-altered-research/">STAT reported</a> in October 2021:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21859930/">Two</a> of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22129598/">papers </a>were cited in a 2013 patent granted to the company, while <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22960190/">three</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23055539/">altered </a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25187433/">papers </a>co-authored by Kawas were referenced in an Athira application for $15 million funding from the National Institutes of Health, which STAT obtained <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/05/athira-cited-altered-studies-in-nih-grant-application-creating-legal-risk/">through a Freedom of Information request</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“To its credit, Athira immediately notified NIH of the research misconduct after the full board of directors learned of it,” U.S. attorney Tessa M. Gorman said in the Jan. 6 statement. “The company’s transparency significantly helped Athira mitigate its damages and demonstrated its resolve towards coming into compliance with the relevant law and regulations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement resolves claims made by Andrew P. Mallon, who filed a whistleblower suit under the False Claims Act. Mallon is to receive $203,434 as part of the settlement, according to the DOJ statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At publication time, Kawas, Athira and Mallon had not responded to requests for comment.</p>



<p>The settlement comes on the heels of news that Athira <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/athira-pharma-faces-nasdaq-delisting-over-share-price-93CH-3671599">faces Nasdaq delisting</a> because its stock price does not meet the minimum bid price requirement. In September, <a href="https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/athira-pharma-to-lay-off-70-of-workforce">the company announced</a> it was cutting 49 positions, or 70 percent of its workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kawas is now cofounder and managing general partner of Propel Bio Partners, a venture capital firm, according to the Propel Bio Partners <a href="https://www.propelbio.com/team/leen-kawas-phd/">website</a>. She has also published a <a href="https://leenkawas.medium.com/">regular column at Medium</a>, including a recent entry on turning “<a href="https://leenkawas.medium.com/forbecouncil-post-resilience-in-action-how-women-can-turn-setbacks-into-strengths-71ec712d80bd">setbacks into strengths</a>.”</p>

<p>The publisher of the <em>Journal of Human Evolution </em>says it does not use artificial intelligence in its production process, contrary to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Social-Media-Statement-re-JHE-Resignations.pdf">a statement</a> issued last month by the journal’s editorial board <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/27/evolution-journal-editors-resign-en-masse-to-protest-elsevier-changes/">when all but one member of the group resigned</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement, <a href="https://x.com/clementzanolli/status/1872352787662852156">shared on X</a> on December 26, noted the journal’s “joint Editors-in-Chief, all Emeritus Editors retired or active in the field, and all but one Associate Editor” were resigning because Elsevier, the journal’s publisher, “has steadily eroded the infrastructure essential to the success of the journal while simultaneously undermining the core principles and practices that have successfully guided the journal for the past 38 years.” Among the examples cited:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130646"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In fall of 2023, for example, without consulting or informing the editors, Elsevier initiated the use of AI during production, creating article proofs devoid of capitalization of all proper nouns (e.g., formally recognized epochs, site names, countries, cities, genera, etc.) as well italics for genera and species. These AI changes reversed the accepted versions of papers that had already been properly formatted by the handling editors.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Retraction Watch has now received a response to a request for comment from an Elsevier spokesperson (our message on Dec. 26 was met with an out-of-office reply, and on Jan. 2 the company said it was still looking into the matter): </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We sincerely thank the outgoing editors, the majority of whom were coming to the end of their term at the end of 2024, for their invaluable contributions and dedication to the journal. We will continue to build on their important work in maintaining the high quality expected of the journal with the new editorial team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We do want to address an important inaccuracy in the statement issued by the outgoing editors, specifically the incorrect linking of a formatting glitch to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in our production processes. We do not use AI in our production processes. The journal trialled a production workflow that inadvertently introduced the formatting errors to which the editors refer. We had already acted on their feedback and reverted to the journal&#8217;s previous workflow earlier in 2024.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-human-evolution/about/editorial-board">the journal’s website</a>, three new editors in chief have been appointed: Nohemi Sala of the National Research Centre on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain; Song Xing of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing; and Radu Iovita of New York University’s Center for the Study of Human Origins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The previous editors in chief, Mark Grabowski and Andrea B. Taylor, did not respond to our request for comment on the board’s resignation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mass resignation is the 20th such episode since early 2023, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">our records</a>.</p>

<p>Please join us in welcoming two new Retraction Watch staff members: Managing editor Kate Travis, and reporter Avery Orrall.</p>



<p>Kate comes to us with a long and impressive resume. She has served as digital director at <em>Science News</em>, an editor for <em>Science</em>’s careers website, Science Careers, and news editor of the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>. She contributed a chapter to <em>A Tactical Guide to Science Journalism</em>, is the coordinator of the National Association of Science Writers&#8217; Science in Society Journalism Awards, and serves as the part-time managing editor of Connector, an online library of resources on science writing produced by the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing. Reach her at <a href="mailto:kate@retractionwatch.com">kate@retractionwatch.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avery’s name will be familiar to readers, as she was one of our two summer interns last year and has since been our newsletter editor. She is a recent graduate of New York University’s Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program, and has also interned at <em>JAMA Medical News</em>. Reach her at <a href="mailto:avery@retractionwatch.com">avery@retractionwatch.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130617"></span>



<p>Kate and Avery take over from Fred Joelving and Ellie Kincaid, who will remain as contributing editors and are still reachable at <a href="mailto:frederik@retractionwatch.com">frederik@retractionwatch.com</a> and <a href="mailto:ellie@retractionwatch.com">ellie@retractionwatch.com</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the creation of the Retraction Watch Sleuth in Residence Program, an opportunity for a sleuth to spend a year working with us.</p>



<p>Too often, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">sleuths</a> work for free, often at great legal and personal risk. We want to build capacity in this space so others see the value of compensating and protecting the critical work of sleuths.</p>



<p>The goal of this program – funded by a generous donation from George Tidmarsh – is to offer a secure and paid position for an active sleuth with a proven track record. The Sleuth in Residence would work closely with our research team on specific projects, and with our journalism team to publish their findings. All of that work would go through rigorous review and be covered by our defamation insurance policy.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130613"></span>



<p>Retraction Watch is a fully remote workplace, and the Sleuth in Residence can be based anywhere in the world, as long as successful candidates can commit to significant overlap with U.S. time zone working hours.</p>



<p>We do not offer health insurance but U.S. employees are eligible for a 401(k) with a generous match. We also offer paid vacation time and unlimited sick time. This is a one-year position with a $65,000 annual salary.</p>



<p>Interested? Please send a cover letter with a description of your sleuthing experience and a resume to team@retractionwatch.com.</p>

                <h4>Feeling a bit wired</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*02_Fo1ReZoUPx2CMzi4J8A.jpeg" /><figcaption>Credit: Dee from Pixabay</figcaption></figure><p>Eight years I’ve been writing these annual reviews. Eight. I now regret starting the tradition of opening each with a pithy, allegedly humorous take on the year’s political news. When I started these in 2016 the idea was that, surely, things couldn’t get much worse — many people of the UK had voted to leave the EU, many people of the US had voted to take leave of their senses — and so future news round-ups would show the arc of history bending back in a better, happier direction, as we returned to meaningful international cooperation and tackled crises like climate change and mass migration together. Bloody hell was I wrong. The arc of history bends slowly.</p><p>So stuff the politics, let’s do some brains. The arc of science tends forward, progressing, improving. Science is always, in the round, a source of hope. As individuals we scientists may moan about our lot as researchers, or about crap studies, or terrible statistics, or how our institutions treat us. Yet our individual grumpiness adds up to constant, yearning improvement. Here are four small yet significant ways we improved our understanding of the brain this year. And odds are good something here will be true now and forever. Isn’t that cool?</p><h4>1. Vision quest</h4><p>Here’s a thought: Might we consider studying vision in an animal that uses it? Don’t get me wrong, we’ve learnt a lot from studying the visual system of rodents, from the details of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03044-3">how cortex is wired</a> to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2130-2">limits of sensory coding</a>. And all of our most powerful tools, from imaging the neural activity of specific neurons to perturbing that activity with light, are most easily and powerfully used in mice, with the consequence that they are the animal of choice for large-scale work in visual neuroscience, notably by the Allen Brain Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.</p><p>But mice and rats are nocturnal. (I confidently state ‘nocturnal’, like all writers on this topic, yet my mind can’t help but turn to the large rat that has recently taken to visiting our lawn, joyfully bounding across it pretending to be a squirrel, occasionally pausing to take the air, in broad daylight, while our cat sits on the dining room table staring at it through the window with a demeanour of “it’s not my problem, mate” when it very much is.) Mice and rats can navigate the world just fine without light, or eyes, through a mixture of their sense of smell, their ability to keep track of their self-motion better than us (not hard) and, especially, their whiskers, which probe and prod the ground in front and objects around. Crudely put, their eyes are for detecting potential threats (things above them) and food (things below them). Not for watching Bridgerton or football or clips of pandas falling off logs. Rodents are a poor model for how humans use their eyes.</p><p>A lovely paper this year showed us something of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48374-2">what we might be missing</a>. It simply asked, how does primate and rodent navigation differ? Our intrepid authors turned to the (common) marmoset, that like us is a primate, lives its waking life in daylight, and uses it front-facing big eyes to guide its behaviour. It’s also a cute, small 20-cm high monkey.</p><p>By letting their marmosets forage freely in a 3D, split-level box rather like a massive hamster play arena (the arena is massive, not the hamsters), they found two basic differences from rodent vision. The first is that rats explore by moving, not looking; marmosets, by contrast, explore by looking, not moving. Not in itself a startling revelation, for that’s what we do: we scan our environments, noting salient features like the clock tower yonder or the small bronze statute of a urinating boy over there. But that’s the point. Rodents don’t do this.</p><p>The second difference is in the marmoset hippocampus. If you want to look at how animals are literally representing their place in the world, look there, for that is where are found the Nobel-prize winning place cells, the neurons that fire when a rodent is in a specific location of the world. So the team looked there in the marmosets. And found that no neuron was just a place cell. Sure, a majority of them had firing that related to where the marmoset was in the 3D, split-level box. But all of those neurons coded for something else too, and the majority of that was the view: what specific view the marmoset was looking at. And those place-related neurons did not cover much of the big box, whereas the view-related neurons did. Use an animal that has eyes to see and it turns out it uses different representations of the world than a rodent. What were the odds?</p><h4>2. Fly in the ointment</h4><p>As regular readers may recall, <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/mindlessly-mapping-the-brain-1dec092a404d">I’ve been sceptical </a>about the worth of connectomes, of building the complete wiring diagram of the connections between each and every neuron in a brain. The source of the scepticism was simple: a wiring diagram is a terrific reference tool, just like the genome, making it easier to identify the parts of a brain and, when recording neurons, providing a way to better guess which neurons and what they connect to. But it is just a description, with little hypothesis-driven science possible without major further work. This scepticism has taken a beating recently. In 2021 <a href="https://drmdhumphries.medium.com/maps-of-a-growing-brain-show-that-genes-do-less-than-we-thought-1d08684b7cb8">Witvliet and co showed</a> it was possible to derive scientific insight from the connectome alone — all you needed was more than one. They mapped the neural development of the tiny worm <em>C Elegans</em> by reconstructing connectomes at key stages of its life, providing, among other things, more strong evidence for the crucial role of randomness in the wiring of brains, even in a brain with just 302 neurons. And then, this year, <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-024-00053-4/index.html">FlyWire dropped</a>.</p><p>At its heart, FlyWire is the full connectome of the brain of the adult female fruit fly (or <em>Drosophila melongaster </em>if you insist). It’s a monster, in connectome terms: 140,000 neurons divided into a strangely-precise 8453 types of neuron and connected by about 50 million synapses, making up to 15 million connections between neurons (if we count every single synaptic connection). A lot of wire in a tiny brain of a tiny fly.</p><p>But what made FlyWire special was the not the admittedly impressive technical feat of tracing all that wire but the effort put in to then doing science with it, to show how it could be used to drive knowledge forward. Officially, FlyWire <a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/hgcfafejia">dropped 11 papers as a collection</a> across the <em>Nature</em> journals, ranging from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07763-9">a simulation</a> that literally placed a model neuron everywhere there was an actual neuron, to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07854-7">a detailed probe of how the fly stops walking</a>, using the connectome to show at least 3 separate neural pathways that call a halt, two seemingly specialised in stopping the fly to consume food rather than wandering past it looking mournfully at what it could have eaten, the third holding the fly still while grooming, so it doesn’t try to rub its face and walk at the same time, fall flat on its proboscis and look a bit of a prat to its mates.</p><p>Officially 11 papers; unofficially, I’d say at least 14. Pretty much every experimental, theory, and modelling paper relied on<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.03.016"> a crucial <em>Cell </em>paper</a> from earlier this year that had inferred the sign of each connection already, whether it excited or inhibited it target — without that, much of the theory and modelling work would have been impossible. And two of the best papers appeared earlier this year, studying deep neural network models of the fly brain that were strongly constrained by the connectome: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07939-3">Lappalainen et al showed us</a> that training wiring-constrained deep networks to track the visual flow of the world as the fly moves recovered many known types of neuron responses and predicted new ones; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07451-8">Cowley &amp; co showed us </a>a beautifully tight model-experiment interplay by training a deep network model to match the behavioural effects of knocking-out each of 23 types of early visual system neuron in the fly.</p><p>We cannot of course abandon all scepticism, for science proceeds through reasonable doubt. Types of neurons remain a nebulous concept: it was telling that about a third of the neuron types found in the previously-published, partial half-brain connectome of the adult female fruit fly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07686-5">could not be found in the newly-constructed full brain</a>. The favoured explanation is that the disagreement represents variation between individual flies. The figure of 8453 types was arrived at by taking a consensus across three half-brains: the previous half-brain one, and treating the new, complete one as two halves. But how can it be a neuron “type” if it is simply missing from a different individual of the same species (and one, I suspect, that is genetically-identical)?</p><p>And deeply impressive as FlyWire is, the problem of scale remains: if we could scale the technology to the whole mouse brain, would such a synaptic-level connectome hold any value? After all, the constraints of genetically-specified connections between neurons must get weaker as the brains get bigger, so random chance plays more and more of a role in initial development, and life experience plays more and more of a role in sculpting connections from that baseline. What we want instead are the rules for wiring, but for that we need many, many connectomes, in order to infer the general principles they share. This creates a connectome paradox: as the brains get bigger so, conversely, the value of individual connectomes gets smaller. This suggests only making the leap to doing many brains at once is worth it, with little pay-off in the short-term. In the past I would have questioned whether it was worth it; FlyWire has given me pause for thought.</p><h4>3. Shining a light in the dark</h4><p>Two papers especially piqued my interest this year as they were on topics close to my heart. The first paper gave a new take on dark neurons. I’ve written much about them before, including a dedicated chapter in <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691241487/the-spike?_gl=1*147tsvi*_up*MQ..*_ga*OTA5MDEyMDc5LjE3MjM2NTY5Nzg.*_ga_N1W9JWKLY3*MTcyMzY1Njk3Ny4xLjEuMTcyMzY1NzAwOC4yOS4wLjE1ODIwMDA4NDI.">my book <em>The Spike</em></a>. The short version is that cortical activity obeys a rough 80:20 rule — 80% of spikes come from just 20% of the neurons. That means the other 80% are mostly silent, firing much less than 1 spike every second. For any given moment in time, for any given behaviour, they are not active: they are dark. This raises the question of what they are for. Perhaps they are reserve neurons, awaiting recruitment to represent something new; perhaps they’re just very picky and we’ve just never shown them anything they’re interested in.</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.04.015">Work from Oliver Gauld and colleagues</a> in Michael Hausser’s lab this year offered a new view, that dark neurons are not reluctant to respond, they are actively suppressed. They looked at neurons in the barrel cortex, the neurons whose job is supposed to be responding to deflections of a single, unique whisker on a rodent’s face. They looked there because many of them don’t. It’s their only job, yet many neurons in a single “barrel”, representing a single whisker, don’t respond to deflections of that whisker. Indeed some of our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.026">best early evidence of dark neurons</a> came from the total lack of response from neurons in barrel cortex.</p><p>Gauld and co flicked a whisker on each side of a mouse’s face at the same time and simply asked it to report which side had moved the most. Many neurons in layers 2 and 3 of that whisker’s “barrel” were dark to the stimulus, not responding differently whether the left or right whisker had be stimulated. Yet activating enough neurons using light could bias the mouse’s choice to the other side, as though, when forced to be active, these dark neurons were perfectly capable of transmitting information about the whisker. So why didn’t they normally? Because they were locally and actively suppressed: the more some neurons were stimulated, the more the unstimulated neurons around them reduced their activity. This gives us a new “sparse coding” hypothesis for why neurons are dark: not because they are hardwired to respond to just a few, select features of the world, but because they are actively suppressed from responding. Some light in the darkness.</p><h4>4. How low can you go?</h4><p>The other paper that especially piqued my interest was a thought-provoking take on the dimensionality question: how many dimensions does neural activity have? It’s now routine to take a recording of hundreds or thousands of neurons and ask if the dynamics so captured have fewer dimensions than there are neurons. One reason to do this is that it makes understanding the brain easier: we don’t have to worry about coding in thousands of neurons, but just a comparative handful of dimensions of activity. Recently, <a href="https:/​/​doi.org/​10.51628/​001c.24619.">I’d pointed out that</a> as we increase the number of recorded neurons we hope the number of additional dimensions doesn’t scale with them; rather, we hope the number of dimensions of neural activity has a hard upper limit that is a tiny percentage of the number of neurons. Consider what happens if it doesn’t. There are about half a million neurons in the primary visual cortex of a mouse and about 50 million neurons in the primary motor cortex of a macaque monkey. Even if the number of dimensions of activity is just 1 percent of the number of neurons then if the dimensions of activity scales all the way to the full extent of the region’s neurons that’s still 5,000 dimensions in mouse visual cortex and 500,000 dimensions in the macaque’s motor cortex. That’s still high-dimensional in anyone’s book. This year, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.02.011">the 1-million-neuron paper</a> appeared in Neuron, and had a first crack at answering to this question.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/now-we-can-record-one-million-neurons-at-the-same-time-25b0c9607e7d?source=user_profile_page---------14-------------6bce9fc81f1f---------------">I’d previously covered</a> this technical marvel when it was a pre-print: the scaling of calcium imaging to cover vast chunks of a mouse’s cortex, with typical recordings in the low hundreds of thousands, and one exemplar obtaining the activity of 1 million neurons at (roughly) the same time. So this team were the best-placed on the planet to ask how dimensions of activity scale with the number of neurons.</p><p>They estimated the number of “reliable” dimensions in the activity, essentially by finding how many dimensions were needed to capture the variation in activity of two sets of neurons at the same time — the idea being that these dimensions must be common to both sets, and thus not noise. And while 16 of these dimensions captured about half the variation in activity, the number of reliable dimensions grew unbounded with the number of neurons.</p><p>On the one hand, this means that we can indeed describe a good chunk of activity with just a handful of dimensions. But on the other, it implies that recordings have to scale with the size of the targeted population in order to capture all that population’s shared dynamics. Which raises the obvious question: how do we know how big the targeted population is? But that’s a story for a different time.</p><h4>Is this thing on?</h4><p>There was so much more of course. Rafal Bogacz and crew kicked the year off by taking a different slant on the problem of how the brain could approximate backprop and hence learn like an artificial neural network. Their slant being: <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1">it doesn’t, that would be silly</a>. Instead, they proposed that a network of neurons predicts what the neural activity at the end of learning should look like, and then change synaptic weights according to whether that prediction looks correct or not. We also had much more on how psychedelics alter brain function, including suggestions they <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5">desynchronise activity in the human brain</a>. And if you like science cartography, there’s now a map of <a href="http://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(24)00076-X">the whole of PubMed</a>.</p><p>We also welcomed a new voice for neuroscience, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/"><em>The Transmitter</em></a>, an ambitious online magazine offering us deep dives into neuroscience news and opinions, with that most unusual of things, a dedicated editorial team and a roster of journalists. Two examples of some great journalism this year: <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/brain-stimulation/putting-a-bright-idea-to-the-test/">Shaena Montanari’s investigation</a> into the whether simply flickering a light at 40Hz could clear Alzheimer’s brains of the amyloid plaques linked to the dementia, and <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/dopamine/reconstructing-dopamines-link-to-reward/">Angie Voyles Askham’s deep dive</a> into the controversy of whether its time to abandon one of the success stories of modern neuroscience, the reward prediction error theory of dopamine.</p><p>And, full disclosure, The Transmitter is also in my news this year: I’ve <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/contributor/mark-humphries/">started a regular column</a> there (apologies for the massive picture of my face that is at the end of the link — please scroll down quickly), kicking off with why <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/neural-coding/averaging-is-a-convenient-fiction-of-neuroscience/">averaging is holding back neuroscience</a> and imagining the<a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/systems-neuroscience/imagining-the-ultimate-systems-neuroscience-paper/"> ultimate systems neuroscience paper</a>.</p><p>You could sign up to follow me there for more in 2025. You could continue to mournfully scroll through your social media feed. Either way, all I can suggest is that, if you’re after good news in 2025, it’s probably best to stick to science.</p><p>Liked this?

<p>All but one member of the editorial board of the <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em> (JHE), an Elsevier title, have resigned, saying the “sustained actions of Elsevier are fundamentally incompatible with the ethos of the journal and preclude maintaining the quality and integrity fundamental to JHE’s success.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Elsevier has steadily eroded the infrastructure essential to the success of the journal while simultaneously undermining the core principles and practices that have successfully guided the journal for the past 38 years,” the journal’s “joint Editors-in-Chief, all Emeritus Editors retired or active in the field, and all but one Associate Editor” said in their resignation <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Social-Media-Statement-re-JHE-Resignations.pdf">statement</a> posted to <a href="https://x.com/clementzanolli/status/1872352787662852156">X/Twitter</a> yesterday.</p>



<p>Among other moves, according to the statement, Elsevier “eliminated support for a copy editor and special issues editor,” which they interpreted as saying “editors should not be paying attention to language, grammar, readability, consistency, or accuracy of proper nomenclature or formatting.” The editors say the publisher “frequently introduces errors during production that were not present in the accepted manuscript:”</p>



<span id="more-130593"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In fall of 2023, for example, without consulting or informing the editors, Elsevier initiated the use of AI during production, creating article proofs devoid of capitalization of all proper nouns (e.g., formally recognized epochs, site names, countries, cities, genera, etc.) as well italics for genera and species. These AI changes reversed the accepted versions of papers that had already been properly formatted by the handling editors. This was highly embarrassing for the journal and resolution took six months and was achieved only through the persistent efforts of the editors. AI processing continues to be used and regularly reformats submitted manuscripts to change meaning and formatting and require extensive author and editor oversight during proof stage.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The resigning editors also said Elsevier “unilaterally took full control over” the editorial board’s “scientific structure and composition” by requiring all editors sign a new contract every year,” leading to a decline in the number of associate editors. The publisher also “indicated it would no longer support the dual-editor [in chief] model that has been a hallmark of JHE since 1986,” according to the statement. “When the editors vehemently opposed this action, Elsevier said it would support a dual-editor model by cutting the compensation rate by half.”</p>



<p>Editors also raised concerns about article processing charges at the journal of $3,990 that “remain out of reach for much of our authorship” and are as much as twice those “of discipline-comparable Elsevier-published journals.”</p>



<p>Attempts to seek comment from Elsevier and to learn the name of the associate editor who did not resign from the recently resigned editors in chief were met with holiday out-of-office replies. We will update this post with anything we learn.  <em>[Update, 1/6/25: <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/01/06/elsevier-denies-ai-use-in-response-to-evolution-journal-board-resignations/">We have now received a reply from Elsevier.</a>]</em></p>



<p>The mass resignation is the 20th such episode since early 2023, according to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">our records</a>. Earlier this year, <em>Nature</em> asked, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00887-y">what do these group exits achieve</a>?”</p>

<p>If 2024 felt like a whirlwind, you’re not alone. It was another busy one here at Retraction Watch, too.</p>



<p>Some numbers to tell that story:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>2024 was a record traffic year for us, with 7.5 million pageviews – a 15 percent jump from the previous record, set in 2015, thanks to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/20/author-retracts-study-of-changing-minds-on-same-sex-marriage-after-colleague-admits-data-were-faked/">scoop</a> some longtime readers may remember. </li>



<li>Here’s our <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/retractionwatch.com/post/3le7nswez3s23">top 10 list</a> by traffic (in a thread over at Bluesky, which we joined in November).</li>



<li>The <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org">Retraction Watch Database</a> – now part of Crossref – has just shy of 55,000 retraction entries, and counting.</li>
</ul>



<p>A sampling of a few other key accomplishments this year:</p>



<span id="more-130589"></span>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We published four major investigations in <em>Science</em>. One piece exposed what one researcher called a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings">“nasty” publishing scheme</a> at a dental school to boost its global rankings. Another revealed that paper mills – a major scourge of today’s publishers – have been <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">bribing editors at prestigious journals</a> to ensure their clients’ work is published.  We also found companies are <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/questionable-firms-tempt-young-doctors-with-easy-publications">preying on doctors</a> desperate to publish papers to obtain U.S. residencies. And just last week, we revealed that shoddy commentaries were <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/shoddy-commentaries-quick-and-dirty-route-higher-impact-numbers-are-rise">overwhelming journals in a bid to boost metrics</a>.</li>



<li>Our reporting at Retraction Watch has had significant impact, including the resignation of deans in <a href="https://nevadasagebrush.com/2024/04/15/unr-dean-of-engineering-replaced-associate-dean-taking-place/">Nevada</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/19/dean-in-indonesia-resigns-following-retraction-watch-report/">Indonesia</a>, the retraction of a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/22/exclusive-elsevier-to-retract-paper-by-economist-who-failed-to-disclose-data-tinkering/">flawed paper in economics</a>, and the retraction of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/30/journal-retracts-80-papers-idd-as-paper-mill-products-following-sleuths-report-undark-retraction-watch-investigation/">80 papers at once</a> for compromised peer review.</li>



<li>We published op-eds in <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-06-24/scientific-fraud-the-case-of-the-spanish-university-rector-should-prompt-change-to-ranking-system.html"><em>El Pais</em></a>, <a href="https://thanhnien.vn/vi-sao-khong-nen-phi-thoi-gian-cho-cac-bang-xep-hang-nha-khoa-hoc-185240822195312368.htm"><em>Thanh Nien</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/11/scientific-journals-retractions-paper-mills/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</li>



<li>Anna Abalkina, our partner on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/">Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03894-1">named one of the Nature 10</a>, a “list of people who shaped science in 2024.”</li>



<li>We gave <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/documentviewer/en/44-1/SRSR/meeting-112/evidence">testimony</a> to the Canadian Parliament’s Standing Committee on Science and Research.</li>



<li>We gave invited talks around the world, from <a href="https://unmevents.unm.edu/event/keynote-ivan-oransky-md---retractions-on-the-rise-but-not-enough/">Albuquerque</a> to <a href="https://www.uksg.org/events/conference24/">Glasgow</a> to <a href="https://eur-gene.u-paris.fr/en/%C3%A9v%C3%A8nement/__trashed/">Paris</a>.</li>

<p>A committee of scholars in Finland has decided to downgrade 271 journals from Frontiers and MDPI in their quality rating system, in a move that may discourage researchers from submitting manuscripts to the outlets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both publishers criticized the move, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/finland-downgrades-mdpi-and-frontiers-will-others-follow-suit">first reported</a> in <em>Times Higher Education</em>, as lacking transparency and seeming to target fully open-access publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finland’s Publication Forum (JUFO) “is a rating and classification system to support the quality assessment of research output,” which factors into government funding for universities, according to its website. “The objective is to encourage Finnish scholars and researchers to publish their research outcomes in high-level domestic and foreign forums.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-130575"></span>



<p>JUFO rates journals on a scale from 1 to 3, with higher ratings corresponding to more points for funding. Publications in titles rated “<a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/faq-0#Q5">level 0</a>” count the same as popular articles or scientific articles that haven’t been peer-reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, as we reported, JUFO <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/28/finland-group-downgrades-60-journals/">downgraded 60 journals</a>, most of them from MDPI, from level 1 to level 0&nbsp; after soliciting feedback from researchers about their experiences with the quality of publications in scientific journals.</p>



<p>JUFO later <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/grey-area-journals-level-0">decided it would downgrade</a> MDPI and Frontiers journals to level 0 in 2025, calling the publications “grey area journals” which “make use of the APC (Article Processing Charge) operating model and aim to increase the number of publications with the minimum time spend for editorial work and quality assessment.” The announcement continued:&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most important changes in scientific publishing in Finland is the <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/publication-volume-decreased-mdpi-journals">sharp increase in the number of articles</a> published especially in MDPI and Frontiers open access journals operating with APC fees. The scientific community’s key concern is, whether the costs of open access publishing increases unreasonably, and whether the increase happens at the expense of a thorough quality assessment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On December 16, JUFO released a <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/sites/default/files/2024-12/List%20of%20journals%20to%20be%20downgraded%20to%20level%200.pdf">list</a> of 271 journals that will be downgraded to level 0 next year, 193 from MDPI and 78 from Frontiers. Based on suggestions from discipline-specific panels of experts, JUFO kept 16 MDPI and 22 Frontiers journals at level 1, the <a href="https://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/news/changes-classification">announcement</a> stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are deeply concerned by JUFO&#8217;s recent decision and find it challenging to understand the objectivity of the applied criteria,” Giulia Stefenelli, scientific communications lead for MDPI, said in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MDPI-comment.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch. “The simultaneous downgrade of 271 journals suggests a generalized evaluation process rather than a fair assessment of each journal’s merit.” </p>



<p>In October, the sudden death of a young MDPI employee <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/10/22/young-employees-death-puts-workplace-culture-in-spotlight-at-publisher-mdpi/">raised questions about the workplace culture at the company</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Frontiers-comment.pdf">statement</a> to Retraction Watch, Shirley Dent, head of public relations for Frontiers, said all of the publisher’s downgraded journals meet JUFO’s criteria for level 1 ranking. “Targeting” publishers with author-funded open-access models “is both unfair and arbitrary – the assessment ranking of journals should simply be based on the quality and value of services provided,” Dent said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dent also said JUFO’s statement on their decision “does not provide any evidence” but points to “hearsay, anecdote and discredited lists.” Frontiers did not receive any “substantial feedback” about issues to address, “which is the core criterion of any evaluation process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“​​The decision can only be interpreted as an attack on a publishing model, rather than as an assessment of journal quality,”&nbsp; she said, in comments <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2024/12/19/institutional-journal-lists-place-an-unfair-burden-on-publishers/">echoing those by Frontiers&#8217; Fred Fenter in the LSE Impact Blog</a>.</p>
