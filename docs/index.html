<p>Frontiers has issued a retraction and multiple corrections for papers in several of its journals after the publisher discovered a reviewer had been impersonated.</p>



<p>Alla El-Din Bekhit is listed as the editor of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1076815/full">the retracted article</a>, a study of the potential anti-cancer effects of asparagus extract published in <em>Frontiers in Pharmacology</em> in May 2023. According to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1563699/full">the retraction notice</a>, dated January 26, the article contained duplicated images and “concerns were raised regarding scientific validity of the article.” The notice continues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Further, the investigation confirmed that a non-genuine email address was used to impersonate Alaa El-Din Bekhit and the real Alaa El-Din Bekhit did not take any actions on this manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-131433"></span>



<p>The publisher also issued corrections for four papers in different journals in late January and early February, which included similar notes. The papers are a 2024 article on the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1563555/full">global burden of diets high in processed meat</a>, a 2022 article on <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2025.1567490/full">factors affecting the quality of meat </a>from lambs in Inner Mongolia, a 2022 systematic review of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/bioengineering-and-biotechnology/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2025.1562494/full">nanomaterial scaffolds in bone regeneration</a>, and a 2022 review article on <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/chemistry/articles/10.3389/fchem.2025.1562415/full">perovskite solar cells</a>.</p>



<p>The affiliations of the researchers on all five articles are various universities and institutes in China, with no overlap.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/food-science/our-people-in-food-science/professor-alaa-el-din-ahmed-bekhit">real Alaa El-Din Bekhit</a> is a meat scientist and food technologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. He told us he co-edited <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/28242/global-excellence-in-food-chemistry/magazine?page=2">a special issue on global food chemistry</a> for <em>Frontiers in Nutrition</em> in 2022, but otherwise is not an editor for Frontiers and had not seen the articles. He told us in an email:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The journal contacted me some time ago last year enquiring about my involvement in these publications, and It was new news to me. I was very angry about how easily people&#8217;s identities can be misused. … I asked them to remove my association with any of these publications and make it clear that someone impersonated me. I requested to get authorities involved since this fraud. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>A spokesperson for Frontiers reiterated the published statements, and elaborated on the corrections versus retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Following publication, Frontiers found an email address provided for Alaa El-Din Bekhit in connection with several articles was not genuine. Investigations into each of these articles, conducted in accordance with Frontiers’ policy and after consulting with the real Alaa El-Din Bekhit, confirmed that the real Alaa El-Din Bekhit was impersonated and did not take any action on the articles concerned. Alaa El-Din Bekhit’s name was therefore removed from these articles.  </p>



<p>For four articles, the post-publication review concluded that the articles meet the standards for publication at Frontiers. Since the impersonation did not affect the validity of the research findings, errata were issued to correct the reviewer information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite stating that Bekhit’s name was removed from the articles, Frontiers had not as of March 13 removed Bekhit’s name from the <a href="https://archive.is/gP4RF">HTML</a> or <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1563699/pdf">PDF</a> versions of the retracted article. </p>



<p>The scam of impersonating a peer reviewer or editor <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/515480a">is hardly new</a>. Journals <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/18/galling-journal-scammed-by-guest-editor-impersonator/">have been duped</a> by someone impersonating a guest editor. Journals have published, and retracted, articles by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/06/22/mystery-writer-impersonates-cardiovascular-pathologist-and-pens-retracted-paper/">authors impersonating another researcher</a>.&nbsp; And the researchers who get impersonated usually <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/15/more-details-on-the-bmcspringer-retraction-ring-an-impersonated-reviewer-speaks/">aren’t too happy about it</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frontiers acknowledged impersonation as an ongoing issue, telling us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Cases of impersonation are rare but happen across all publishers. When Frontiers encounters fake identities, including impersonation, we take swift and appropriate action and address such cases rigorously in line with our established policies and the guidelines set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of published research remains a top priority for us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Journals and publishers should use verified emails to counteract this issue, Bekhit said.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Calcium indicators are used to report the calcium concentration inside single cells. In neurons, calcium imaging can be used as a readout of neuronal activity (action potentials). However, some calcium indicators like GCaMP transform the calcium concentration of a cell into a fluorescence trace in a non-linear manner, following a sigmoidal curve:</p>

From <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641129">Rupprecht et al, 2025</a>, under CC BY 4.0 license (Figure 3a).

<p>This means that a small change in calcium concentration (ΔC<sub>1</sub>) may increase the fluorescence (ΔF<sub>1</sub>) only slightly, while the same change at a higher starting calcium concentration (ΔC<sub>2</sub>) leads to a much more prominent increase (ΔF<sub>2</sub>).</p>



<p>What many people do not consider is that this property has an effect on complex events with multiple bursts or action potentials in a sequence. The first spikes may only elicit small fluorescence changes, while the later spikes – with a large fraction of calcium ions still bound to the calcium indicators – result in much higher fluorescence changes. As a consequence, this results in a history-dependent bias that underestimates the early and overestimates the late phases of neuronal activity, as demonstrated with these simulated data:</p>

<p>It is striking to see that for the non-linear calcium indicator, the first spike is barely visible, while the later ones are disproportionally amplified compared to the linear fluorescence trace.</p>



<p>Such history-dependent effects are also important to keep in mind when comparing the neuronal activity dynamics across calcium indicators. GCaMP6f, for example, is highly non-linear, showing a strong history-dependent effect. GCaMP8m, on the other hand, seems to behave more linearly in cortical pyramidal neurons. Therefore, dynamics of complex events cannot be compared across these calcium indicators without taking these effects into account. And spike inference (e.g., using <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">CASCADE</a>) must also take these history-dependent effects into account!</p>

<p>The editorial board of an architecture journal has resigned after its parent association cancelled an upcoming theme issue titled “Palestine.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.jaeonline.org/"><em>Journal of Architectural Education</em></a> planned to publish the issue in fall 2025, according to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207170332/https://jaeonline.org/issue/fall-2025/">archived version of the call for papers</a>, which refers to the “Zionist, militarist, carceral, and capitalist regime of Israeli settler colonialism and apartheid.”</p>



<p>“In the face of the ongoing Israeli genocidal campaign against Palestinians in Gaza, this issue of the <em>Journal of Architectural Education</em> calls for urgent reflections on this historical moment’s implications for design, research, and education in architecture,” the call for papers read.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131428"></span>



<p>On February 28, the nonprofit Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, which owns the journal, released a <a href="https://www.acsa-arch.org/acsa-message-about-the-journal-of-architectural-education/">statement</a> saying it was halting the issue for increased risks due to “new actions by the U.S. federal administration.” The statement listed “potential risks” such as “personal threats to journal editors, authors, and reviewers, as well as to ACSA volunteers and staff” as well as “legal and financial risks facing the organization.” ACSA did not respond to our request for comment to expand on what these risks might be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/palestinians-have-no-alternative-leaving-gaza-trump-says-2025-02-04/">suggested</a> Palestinians be permanently relocated from Gaza, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-us-will-take-over-gaza-strip-2025-02-05/">claimed</a> the United States would take over the Gaza Strip. This week immigration agents <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/palestinian-columbia-student-protestors-challenge-arrest-turns-us-federal-court-2025-03-11/">arrested a Palestinian student activist</a> at Columbia University, and Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/columbia-trump-colleges-antisemitism.html">withheld funding</a> from the school, saying it failed to protect Jewish students from anti-semitism. Trump claimed more arrests would follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Palestine issue’s call for papers has been <a href="https://jaeonline.org/issue/fall-2025/">removed</a> from the journal’s website.</p>



<p>The same day the ACSA released its statement, the organization fired McLain Clutter, executive editor of the journal, whose term was <a href="https://www.jaeonline.org/issue-article/jae-announces-mclain-clutter-as-interim-executive-editor/">set to end in 2026</a>. <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2025/02/acsa-cancels-fall-2025-journal-of-architectural-education-issue-on-palestine-and-fires-its-interim-executive-editor/">He told <em>The Architect’s Newspaper</em></a> he was fired for refusing to endorse the ACSA’s decision to halt publication. “ACSA will be on the wrong side of history, and they leave faculty at member institutions with little reason for faith in their support,” he told&nbsp; the newspaper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clutter did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/jabarysalamanca/status/1899363180159115386/photo/3">post on X</a>, <a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/omar-suliman-jabary-salamanca-0/en">Omar Jabary Salamanca</a>, a former member of the editorial board and a postdoctoral researcher at Ghent University in Belgium, posted a letter addressed to the ACSA Board of Directors announcing the board’s&nbsp; “collective resignation, effective immediately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the letter, the resignation resulted from “insulting treatment of its theme editors and the anti-Palestinian nature of their interrogation” as well as “wanton disrespect for the peer-review process.”</p>



<p>“Over the past few months, the ACSA has been unwilling to uphold its commitment to the values of academic freedom and ethical scholarship, contradicting the organization’s stated commitment to equity and justice,” they wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter is unsigned, so whether the entire current board has resigned is unclear. At press time, the journal’s <a href="https://jaeonline.org/editorial-board/">editorial board page</a> returned “Page not found.” Social media posts by Salamanca, <a href="https://architecture.carleton.ca/cu-people/ozayr-saloojee/">Ozayr Saloojee</a>, and <a href="https://www.zoesamudzi.com/">Zoé Samudzi</a> indicate they are among those resigning. The resigning board members plan to host <a href="https://temple.zoom.us/meeting/register/xQPNWqP1QFSvmJGQbyu39g?fbclid=PAY2xjawI_93FleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpgg4nJmyyL5TbytxBl2M-NlonFEA7yc6frDyZ4lhb-6LUsdOASTr86mU1Q_aem_nrH0FkMg5vDRJvMsGRfmdg%23%2Fregistration%23%2Fregistration#/registration">a town hall meeting</a> on March 13 to discuss the decisions and their implications. </p>



<p>Jennifer McMillan, the vice president of external communications for Taylor &amp; Francis, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rjae20">which publishes the journal</a>, told us in an email the decision to cancel the issue “was made by the ACSA Board. As their publishing partners we are respectful of the decision they have made.”</p>

                <p>Today is arXiv&#8217;s Giving Day! arXiv has shaped the past 30 years of scientific discovery &#8211; what do the next 30 years look like? Give to arXiv today and help shape the future of science.</p>
<p>arXiv Giving Day is a part of Cornell Giving Day, which is facilitated by our parent organization, Cornell University. On March 13th, we ask both the Cornell community, and the scientific community at large, to come together in support of important causes that help foster inclusive education, equitable scholarship, and scientific innovation.</p>
<p>The possibilities and potential for scientific discovery provided by arXiv are limitless—but our resources aren’t. arXiv is open and free to use for all, but it is not free to operate. arXiv is a critical community resource, and we depend on you to help us stay fast, free to use, and open for all.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://givingday.cornell.edu/campaigns/arxiv">100% of your contribution today</a> will go towards supporting arXiv&#8217;s infrastructure, operations, and special initiatives.<br />
</strong><br />
arXiv relies on our community for their support &#8211; the majority of arXiv&#8217;s budget comes from the contributions of our community. arXiv is incredibly grateful for continued support from the Simons Foundation and in-kind support from Cornell University. We are also thankful this Giving Day to have our very first match, provided by our very own arXiv Lab <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>! This generous match allows your gifts to arXiv today to go even further.</p>
<p>The future of science starts today, and we couldn&#8217;t do it without you. Thank you for your contribution, whether that is through a gift today, or simply through the use of arXiv in your work and studies. We are proud to provide a platform that helps you share your research with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s work towards a bright future for open science and discovery together.</strong></p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/osaka-univ-research-institute-for-microbial-diseases.png"><img decoding="async" width="767" height="575" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/osaka-univ-research-institute-for-microbial-diseases.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131415" style="width:300px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/osaka-univ-research-institute-for-microbial-diseases.png 767w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/osaka-univ-research-institute-for-microbial-diseases-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A microbiologist formerly of Osaka University has lost four papers, with at least one more retraction pending, after an institutional investigation found fabrication and falsification of data in his published research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation found evidence of manipulated results in seven of the papers examined. The university <a href="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/news/topics/2025/02/07001">published the notice</a> of its completed inquiry, along with a full report in Japanese, on February 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report did not name the scientists or cite the articles investigated, but it did include a figure or table with altered data from each paper. Three papers retracted in February mentioned an investigation by Osaka University in the notices; Yukihiro Hiramatsu was the first author on all three. Comparing the figures in the report with ones in Hiramatsu’s publications, we identified the seven articles. (<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Osaka-investigation-papers-identified-by-Retraction-Watch-6-Feb-2025.pdf">See the list here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-131412"></span>



<p>Three articles have not yet been retracted or corrected, as the university recommended. In response to our request for comment, a representative of Osaka University told us “the authors are currently taking steps to retract or correct” those three papers. A spokesperson for the publisher of the papers told us one retraction was pending and it was still investigating the others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted articles listed Hiramatsu having been working in Osaka’s Research Institute for Microbial Diseases; our email to his university address was not returned and we were unable to find a current affiliation or email for him. The senior author of the articles, <a href="https://www.biken.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/researchers/detail/4">Yasuhiko Horiguchi</a>, did not respond to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigation report refers to the first and corresponding author of most of the papers, Hiramatsu, as “Dr. A.” According to a machine translation of the report, he admitted to most of the research misconduct the investigation identified. “Dr. A” also acknowledged in interviews he was aware his actions constituted misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr. A” told the investigators he committed research misconduct because he wanted to produce favorable data to help him publish papers in higher-quality journals to aid in seeking his next position, according to the report. The report also stated “Dr. A.” said he wanted to spend his time on other, more interesting experiments than those required for publications, and had limited opportunity to do so due to writing papers and grant applications. </p>



<p>Horiguchi, called “Dr. B” in the report, did not ask to see “Dr. A’s” raw data or notebooks, and “Dr. A” did not think such records were always necessary, according to the report. </p>



<p>If the laboratory had a system for checking raw data and notebooks, the misconduct could have been caught sooner, the report concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Hiramatsu’s first <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv4615">retraction</a> came on January 1, for a paper in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade8971"><em>Science Advances</em></a> originally published in 2022. It has been cited five times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice did not mention Osaka University’s investigation. It stated “an author discovered” eight figures in the article plus three supplementary figures “did not have adequate supporting data.” The authors requested the retraction and all agreed to it, according to the notice.</p>



<p><em>mBio</em> and <em>mSphere</em>, titles of the American Society for Microbiology, published similar <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.01072-24">retraction</a> <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mbio.03921-24">notices</a> for two of Hiramatsu’s papers on February 5. The senior and corresponding author’s laboratory conducted an investigation and found data shown in the articles’ figures “are the results of fabricated experiments or extensive falsification,” the notices stated. They continued:&nbsp;</p>



<p>An official investigation is ongoing at Osaka University, and certain results will require further verification by re-experimentation. Therefore, we are retracting the article and regret any inconvenience this may have caused.</p>



<p>The m<em>Sphere</em> <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00819-21">article</a> appeared in October 2021 and has been cited eight times. The <em>mBio</em> <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03197-21">paper</a> appeared in March 2022 and has been cited 12 times, 10 of which were after a <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01446-22">May 2022 correction</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth retracted <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308260120">paper</a> appeared in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> in September 2023 and has been cited twice. The retraction <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2501149122">notice</a>, dated February 11 and signed by all authors except Hiramatsu, stated they were retracting the article because an investigation by Osaka University “has concluded that the majority of this article’s reported results are unreliable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The remaining three articles in which the university found manipulated results were all published in <em>Microbiology and Immunology</em>, a Wiley title, and have yet to be retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us the publisher had decided to retract <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1348-0421.12791">one of the papers</a>, published in March 2020 and cited six times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley’s investigation into the other <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1348-0421.12742">two</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1348-0421.12799">papers</a> continues, according to a spokesperson. While the report called for withdrawing the other papers, it recommended correcting these two articles, which have been cited two and three times, respectively.</p>

<p>To paraphrase one of my former college professors, this post should&#8217;ve been called &#8220;differential equations&#8221;, but then none of you would&#8217;ve clicked on it. I do hope that I didn&#8217;t mention that term too early though and scared you all away. After all, you made the effort of opening this page, so why not read on for 30 more seconds?</p>



<p>I know, scary stuff. But I promise this won&#8217;t be one of those super-abstract, incomprehensible tutorials that assumes you already know the stuff that you&#8217;re here to learn. We&#8217;re going to start from some very basic notions and from truly simple examples. If you&#8217;re a physicist or a mathematician or basically anyone who has a formal education in this topic, you might wanna skip towards the end though. Otherwise you might find yourself screaming at the computer: &#8220;NO! NO! Absolutely not! It&#8217;s not a squiggly math formula, it&#8217;s an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives! <strong><em>Everybody</em></strong> knows that!&#8221; I do get your frustration, but some people need to start from somewhere else to get to where you already are.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a differential equation? Well, it&#8217;s a squiggly math formula that lets us describe a whole lot of things. Today we care about things changing over time. In the case of our virtual neuron, that would be the evolution of its membrane potential over time. But simulating that requires us to understand some basics, so we&#8217;ll start with something simpler. Much simpler.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re watching a cat that&#8217;s moving around. And because we have literally nothing better to do in this imaginary world, we want to describe the distance that the cat is covering over a period of 30 seconds. At the beginning of this silly &#8220;experiment&#8221;, that is, at time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 0" class="latex" />, the distance covered is 0 centimeters, because the cat is just chilling for now.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">But as it notices that we&#8217;re staring, it presumably gets a bit creeped out, so it starts to slowly inch away from us. That&#8217;s great news, because now we can proceed with our observations: we see that after one second (<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 1" class="latex" />), the cat has moved 1 centimeter (we will denote that as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 1" class="latex" />), after 2 seconds &#8211; 2 centimeters, and so on, until, after 30 seconds, it went 30 centimeters away from us. We can visualize that below.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In formal math, we would write that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+1%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;begin{aligned} &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} = 1&#92;end{aligned}" class="latex" />. Why? It&#8217;s because for every unit of time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> (for every second in this case), there is an increase in the distance <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> of 1 (centimeter). In other words, the change in distance (<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3Ddx&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="=dx" class="latex" />) per unit change in time (<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3Ddt&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="=dt" class="latex" />) is always 1. <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt}" class="latex" /> is also called the <em>rate of change of x</em>.</p>



<p>While we wrapped our heads around that, the cat got even more weirded out and now it&#8217;s actively trying to outrun us, so it&#8217;s actually picking up speed the longer we look at it. Since, like I mentioned, we&#8217;re really bored, this is even more interesting, so we begin a new observation period. This time, the cat starts again at 0, but after 1 second, it&#8217;s 1 centimeter away, after 2 seconds &#8211; 4 centimeters, after 3 seconds &#8211; 9 centimeters, and so on, until, at the end of our standard 30 seconds, it&#8217;s a full 900 centimeters away!</p>

<p>Again, in math, the pattern we observed above could be written as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+t%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = t^2" class="latex" />, and the corresponding differential equation would be <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+2t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} = 2t" class="latex" />. Now, maybe you&#8217;re wondering how you&#8217;re supposed to guess what the differential equations of functions are. Well, for now, you aren&#8217;t. For the more basic functions, you can find tables online. You can also use WolframAlpha in a lot of cases. And with time, you might pick up other tricks.</p>

<p>Coming back to the cat, the poor thing seems to have realized there&#8217;s no escape from this imaginary hell, so now it&#8217;s just pacing up and down the room, in a sort of oscillating pattern.</p>

<p>At this point, I assume that you might be asking yourself some of the same questions I did when I first started learning these things, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Where in the freaking fresh hell did this entire thing come from? Am I supposed to just…look at squiggly lines and spit out such formulas?</li>

Who the heck are these? And how do you even pronounce this guy: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />? (It&#8217;s &#8220;nu&#8221;, sounding kind of like &#8220;new&#8221;)</li>



<li><em>hyperventilates in math</em></li>



<li>I want to know who <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dx&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="dx" class="latex" /> is, but in order to do that, I need to know who <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> is? BUT WHO IS <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />??</li>



<li>I just want to get my computer to show me this graph, how am I supposed to go from elvish to code?</li>
</ul>



<p>I get it. Honestly, just breathe. If you wanna shed a few tears or snap a pen, that&#8217;s also ok. After that, bear with me. We will answer all of these one by one, so we will need to dwell in uncertainty for a bit longer. Let&#8217;s start with the easiest part: where did the equation come from? Well… from the internet. And no, you don&#8217;t need to come up with them yourself (at least not yet). As you learn more about the topic, you will see that there are established models for neurons, brain areas, even the whole brain. Of course, if you wanna be hardcore, you might eventually come up with your own model or at least tweak an existing one. But we&#8217;ll get to that later.</p>



<p>Alright, but who are the Greek letters? And for some reason <em>A</em>? I know you&#8217;re going to dislike this, but they are pretty much whomever we want them to be. &#8220;But how do we choose???&#8221;, you&#8217;re probably wondering, crushed under the weight of responsibility. Well, I already picked out some values that look nice, but truth be told, if that weren&#8217;t the case, you&#8217;d have absolutely no idea what would be good values. So you&#8217;d just have to try out a bunch of them, until you found something appropriate. In fact, I encourage you to do so anyway. It&#8217;s at this point that I&#8217;ll share a secret with you: all the Python code for generating the figures in this article can be found <a href="https://codeberg.org/neuronerd/VirtualNeuron">here</a>. And it&#8217;s written in a beginner-friendly way, so hopefully everyone can follow along.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note here that in your journey towards building virtual neurons, brains, or what-have-you, you will often come across such <em>parameters</em>. In some cases, you will know what values to assign to them based on experimental measures or on other people&#8217;s work or on intuition. More commonly, you will have to resort to good ol&#8217; guessing (there are ways to do so automatically and systematically, without having to change each value manually, look at a plot, try another one etc, but that&#8217;s a story for another time).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="solving-equations-alright-the-spiciest-problem-remains-how-do-begin-to-solve-this-beast-how-do-we-go-from-the-mathy-stuff-to-the-pretty-stuff-i-have-to-mention-here-that-some-differential-equations-have-what-s-called-analytical-solutions-that-means-that-you-grab-a-pen-and-a-piece-of-paper-and-you-somehow-solve-the-equation-basically-as-if-you-were-solving-latex-x-2-4-s-1-for-instance-the-first-two-examples-above-can-be-easily-solved-analytically-but-as-equations-become-more-complex-analytical-solutions-are-more-difficult-or-even-impossible-to-obtain-in-that-case-we-need-to-employ-what-s-called-numerical-solutions-here-s-how"><strong>Practical solution to the cat equation</strong></h2>



<p>Alright, the spiciest problem remains: how do begin to solve this beast? How do we go from the mathy stuff to the pretty stuff? I have to mention here that some differential equations have what&#8217;s called analytical solutions &#8211; that means that you grab a pen and a piece of paper and you (somehow) solve the equation, basically as if you were solving <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+2+%3D+4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + 2 = 4" class="latex" />. For instance, the first two examples above can be easily solved analytically. But as equations become more complex, analytical solutions are more difficult, or even impossible to obtain. In that case, we need to employ what&#8217;s called <em>numerical</em> solutions. Here&#8217;s how.</p>



<p>First of all, let&#8217;s be clear on what our objective is: we want to find the values of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> for a range of time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />. As you saw above, in our &#8220;experiments&#8221;, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> starts from 0. In order to be able to numerically solve our equation, we need to know what value <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> has at time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 0" class="latex" /> (this is our <em>initial starting condition</em>). How do we know? Again, we guess. Here as well, we can play around with this. You&#8217;ll notice that, depending on the equation, different guesses might lead to different results. There is a mathematical reason for that, which is a topic in itself, but just to give you a bit of intuition: imagine a hill surrounded by a valley on the right and a lake on the left. If you place a ball on top of the hill (your initial starting condition), one of three things will happen: it will stay there if you place it exactly in the centre, roll towards the valley if you place it slightly towards the right, and roll towards the lake if you place it towards the left. The places where the ball stops moving are called <em>fixed points</em> and their number can be different from 3 depending on the system we&#8217;re studying.</p>



<p>But coming back to our numerical solution. We now have a value for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle x(0)" class="latex" />. In our latest cat example, let&#8217;s say we set <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29+%3D+0.5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0) = 0.5" class="latex" />. To find all other values of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />, we use an iterative approach. Because we know <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)" class="latex" />, we can now calculate <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dx%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="dx(0)" class="latex" /> by simply plugging its value, 0.5, into the differential equation from above (of course, together with the values we set for our parameters <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mu" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;omega" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />, and A): <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dx%280%29+%3D+3+%5Ccdot+%281+-+0.5%5E2%29+%5Ccdot+0.5+-+0.2+%5Ccdot+0.5+%2B+1.5+%5Ccdot+sin%282+%5Ccdot0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="dx(0) = 3 &#92;cdot (1 - 0.5^2) &#92;cdot 0.5 - 0.2 &#92;cdot 0.5 + 1.5 &#92;cdot sin(2 &#92;cdot0)" class="latex" />, which is approximately 1.03.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a step back. We said in the very beginning that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt}" class="latex" /> is the rate of change, how much <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> changes from one time point to another. If we know that the cat was at position 25 at time point <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 5" class="latex" /> and at position 16 at time point <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 4" class="latex" />, then the rate of change is how much the cat changed position (25 &#8211; 16) divided by the amount of time in which it changed its position (in this case, 5 &#8211; 4) or <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%284%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%285%29+-+x%284%29%7D%7Bt+%3D+5+-+t+%3D+4%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(4)}{dt} = &#92;frac{x(5) - x(4)}{t = 5 - t = 4}" class="latex" />. Because we are always increasing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> by the same amount of time, we can call that amount of time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t" class="latex" />. In a more general form, we can then rewrite the equation from before as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t+%2B+%5CDelta+t%29+-+x%28t%29%7D%7Bt+%2B+%5CDelta+t+-+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} = &#92;frac{x(t + &#92;Delta t) - x(t)}{t + &#92;Delta t - t}" class="latex" />. And from there, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t+%2B+%5CDelta+t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t + &#92;Delta t)" class="latex" /> becomes <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%28t%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%28t%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%5Ccdot+%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle x(t) + &#92;frac{dx(t)}{dt} &#92;cdot &#92;Delta t" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>With this is hand, we just need to pick a <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t" class="latex" /> and then we can find <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> for any value of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />, assuming we know (or guess) <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)" class="latex" />. As a rule of thumb, we want to pick <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t" class="latex" /> as small as possible (you can imagine that if we were to look at the cat now and then 10 minutes later, it would probably be very far away from where it started, but if we looked after only 0.1 milliseconds, there would hardly be any change). For the example above, we set <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t+%3D+0.001&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t = 0.001" class="latex" />. <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%281%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(1)" class="latex" /> is then equal to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%280%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bdx%280%29%7D%7Bdt%7D+%5Ccdot+%5CDelta+t+%3D+0.5+%2B+1.03+%5Ccdot+0.001+%3D+0.50103&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=1&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle x(0) + &#92;frac{dx(0)}{dt} &#92;cdot &#92;Delta t = 0.5 + 1.03 &#92;cdot 0.001 = 0.50103" class="latex" />. Hardly any change, right? But repeating the same process for many steps (10.000 steps, to be more exact) gives us the graph above. In practice, how many steps you want to simulate depends both on what you&#8217;re interested in observing and on what your computer can handle.</p>
