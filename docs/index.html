<p>While reviewing her Google Scholar profile to prepare a list of her publications, psychologist Maryam Farhang came across a paper she didn’t recognize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article, in the <em>Journal of Research in Allied Life Sciences,</em><em> </em>included her name and affiliation, but Farhang hadn’t written or contributed to the paper in any way, she told Retraction Watch.<br><br>“I was honestly shocked and very concerned to see my name and affiliation used without my permission,” said Farhang, an associate research professor at Universidad de Las Américas in Chile. “This is not only unethical, but a serious breach of research integrity. As a researcher, authorship comes with responsibility, seeing my name attached to work that I neither wrote nor approved was professionally alarming and personally upsetting.”</p>



<span id="more-134278"></span>



<p>The case is among plenty of others we’ve seen on impersonation in scientific articles. We&#8217;ve reported extensively on the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/23/confusing-and-frankly-disturbing-when-researchers-are-impersonated/">identity theft of researchers</a>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/11/15/more-details-on-the-bmcspringer-retraction-ring-an-impersonated-reviewer-speaks/">people impersonating reviewers</a> or<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/"> former colleagues</a>, and<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/"> journals being hijacked</a>. Farhang&#8217;s case appears similar to that of Canadian exercise physiologist Jamie Burr, who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/23/an-exercise-in-frustration-a-researcher-is-impersonated/">discovered an imposter’s article</a> in the <em>Journal of Blood Disorders &amp; Transfusion</em> in 2021. Some journals have considered <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03341-9">conducting identity checks</a> to expose fake authors and mitigate ongoing impersonation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Farhang <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maryam-farhang-48912b24_academicingrity-researchethics-publicationethics-activity-7408989069944336384-tcB6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;rcm=ACoAAADE7KUB5nqyhP-p3p_zLGtbuAlyyIgMSjE">posted about the misappropriation</a> on LinkedIn, informed her institution of the discovery, and contacted the journal for answers, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Journal of Research in Allied Life Sciences (JRALS), </em>published by Swami Vivekananda University in India<em>, </em>describes itself as a “peer-reviewed, open-access e-journal” that encompasses life sciences, food sciences and behavioural sciences, <a href="https://www.swamivivekanandauniversity.ac.in/jrals/about-the-jounal.php">according to its website.</a> Started in 2025, the journal is not indexed in Scopus or Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Farhang reached out, an associate editor at the journal contacted her and requested a meeting, Farhang told us. During the conversation, the associate editor apologized and explained her name and affiliation were added to the paper “by mistake,” Farhang said. She later received an email from the journal saying the article had been removed. The paper, while not formally retracted, <a href="https://jralsjournal.com/index.php/jrals/article/view/1">no longer appears</a> on the journal’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An editor with <em>JRALS</em> apologized for the incident.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/farhang_jrals.pdf">In an email dated Jan. 2</a> and shared with Retraction Watch, the journal’s Editor-in-chief wrote there was “a misunderstanding and the name was mistakenly used.” The editor offered “sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.” The email is signed “Editor-in-chief, JRALS,” but does not specify a name. </p>



<p>Priyajit Banerjee of Swami Vivekananda University in India is <a href="https://jralsjournal.com/index.php/jrals/about/editorialTeam">listed as editor-in-chief</a> on the journal&#8217;s website. He and associate editor Nilanjana Mitra did not return messages seeking comment. </p>



<p>“Publishers are committed to upholding the highest standards of publication ethics and as a publisher we take every possible measure against publication malpractice,” the journal’s <a href="https://jralsjournal.com/index.php/jrals/pe">ethics statement reads</a>. “Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>JRALS </em>paper<em>, </em>published in May 2025, analyzes technologies applied to the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of autism. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HRqN_L0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Farhang&#8217;s research</a> has focused on adults with mild cognitive impairment, intellectual disabilities and depression. She has written several papers on self-determination in autistic adults, including<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17483107.2025.2586641"> a 2025 article</a> that studied how everyday technologies shape choice, self-regulation and beliefs about the capacity to act in autistic adults.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least two references listed in the <em>JRALS</em> paper appear to be placeholders left in the text with the words “insert pages” and “conference or journal name” in parenthesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the article was removed from the journal’s website and no longer appears on Farhang’s Google Scholar profile, it is still <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/398478105_Emerging_Technologies_in_Diagnosis_Adaptation_of_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder">visible on ResearchGate</a> and on the <a href="https://www.swamivivekanandauniversity.ac.in/jrals/img/pdf/JRALS%20Article%201.pdf">university website</a> associated with the journal, Farhang said. She has submitted a formal removal request to ResearchGate and is waiting for a response, she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In addition to being “very distressing,” Farhang said the experience shows how easily a researcher’s identity can be misused.</p>



<p>“In today’s publishing environment, especially with the growing use of AI tools, stronger safeguards around authorship and editorial practices are clearly needed,” she told us. “Being listed as an author without consent is not just a simple mistake, it directly affects credibility and trust in academic work. I hope that speaking openly about this can help raise awareness and encourage better protections for researchers.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2026/02/27/remembering-joe-halpern/">Remembering Joe Halpern</a></h4>

              
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv is saddened by the <a href="https://www.bangsfuneralhome.com/obituaries/joseph-halpern">recent passing of Joseph “Joe” Halpern</a>, and we join the Cornell and scientific community in celebrating his life and memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph, known by his colleagues and arXiv staff as Joe, was a pioneer in the field of computer science and served as a <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/">professor of computer science at Cornell University for 30 years</a>. Joe’s intellect, expertise, and interests ranged far and wide, from computer science and philosophy, to music and travel. We consider ourselves truly lucky that open science and collaboration &#8211; and ultimately, arXiv &#8211; were counted among Joe’s many passions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe was a dedicated husband and father, a passionate teacher and mentor, and a recipient of prestigious awards such as the Gödel Prize and Dijkstra Prize. Even with a busy schedule that included authoring three influential books, six patents, and over 300 papers, Joe still found time to move computer science forward by dedicating his time to open access research and arXiv.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe was instrumental in creating, leading, and ultimately shaping arXiv’s Computer Science section. When arXiv was founded in 1991, new research sections were added slowly, and as of 1997, there was no central repository for computer science papers. Joe Halpern served as the Chair of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0005003">a committee convened by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</a> in May of 1997 to discuss new ways to disseminate computer science research, with debate on whether the best way to share research was to become a new section of arXiv </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(then known as the Los Alamos National Laboratory e-print archive) or a node in the Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library (NCSTRL). In September 1998, in partnership with arXiv, the</span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/cs/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Computing Research Repository (CoRR)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoRR became the arXiv Computer Science section. With Joe’s guidance, CoRR in its early days took the best of early arXiv &#8211; namely our submission, notification, and search software, created specifically to easily share research and maintain a stable repository &#8211; while also serving as a “node” in the computer-science focused and open federated infrastructure of NCSTRL. This hybrid approach has encouraged arXiv to become more interoperable with other institutions and infrastructures as we grew, and interoperability is still an important goal for arXiv and open research to this day. CoRR, while fully integrated into arXiv from the beginning, maintained its own brand and a separate website until 2001, when NCSTRL was retired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe served as a member of arXiv’s Science Advisory Board and as the Chair of the arXiv Computer Science section from 1998 to 2022, after which he continued to generously give his time and expertise to arXiv as a moderator of the Computer Science General Literature and “Other” categories. From the very beginning, Joe helped set the policies and the acceptance criteria for arXiv’s CS section, and his broad knowledge of the whole field of computer science allowed him to define the categories within CS that arXiv still uses to this day, almost 30 years later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Joe approached me to serve as the moderator for the machine learning category in arXiv CS, way back in 1998,” said Tom Dietterich, Distinguished Professor (Emeritus), Computer Science, Oregon State University, and current Chair of arXiv’s Computer Science Section Editorial Committee. “Joe was always an advocate for light moderation to avoid a ‘gate keeping’ mentality that could be a barrier to newcomers in the field. He cared deeply for the arXiv moderators he led and endeavored to keep moderator work-load manageable, despite the ever-increasing submissions and growth of the CS category. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I finally consented to replace him as CS Chair in November 2022, I continued to rely on Joe’s wisdom and excellent judgment when difficult cases arose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv’s computer science section is one of our fastest growing subject areas, with an average over 10,000 new submissions to the category every month in 2025. arXiv’s computer science section was not always as active as it is today, but Joe stuck with arXiv, despite his busy schedule and opportunities to dedicate his time and talents to many other projects through the years. Joe’s early championing of the section, and continued guidance through the decades, is part of the reason that arXiv’s computer science section was properly prepared to support and openly share the surge of computer science research in the past decade, and become the pioneer of open research it is today. arXiv CS is where computer scientists share and discover new research first, thanks in no small part to Joe Halpern and his work on arXiv.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you Joe for your wisdom, talents, hard work, and passion &#8211; you are already sorely missed. Our thoughts are with Joe’s family at this difficult time &#8211; may Joe’s memory be a blessing to them and to all who knew him.</span></p>

</div>


<p>On Feb. 18, a researcher in Italy sent a disgruntled email to the editorial board of a Wiley tourism journal. <a href="https://docenti.unisi.it/it/salvatorebimonte">Salvatore Bimonte</a> had waited more than a year for his manuscript to be peer-reviewed, he complained, and then months more while the editor-in-chief was “actively working on” the revised version Bimonte submitted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Bimonte’s paper was finally rejected after 18 months — for reasons such as the topic not being “highly suitable” and the work not being submitted in the form of a case study — the researcher felt compelled to vent his frustration to the entire editorial board of the <em>International Journal of Tourism Research</em> (<em>IJTR</em>).</p>



<p>“Maybe, I would have been treated better if I had cited some of the editor in chief&#8217;s papers,” Bimonte, of the University of Siena, wrote in boldface in the email, which we have seen. Two days later, an unhappy editor at the journal quit, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<span id="more-134271"></span>



<p>Since May 2023, the editor-in-chief of <em>IJTR </em>has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260221200950/https:/www.proftimothylee.org">Timothy J. Lee</a>. A professor at Macau University of Science and Technology in Macao, Lee <a href="https://timothylee.academia.edu/cv">promotes</a> that he’s among the world’s <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=jL-XuJQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra">top-cited</a> researchers in 2025, and the <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=search_authors&amp;hl=en&amp;mauthors=label:health_%26_wellness">number one</a> citation-reaper in the category “Health &amp; Wellness” on Google Scholar. He is a member of the editorial boards of “<a href="https://www.proftimothylee.org/about">12 leading academic journals</a>” and was the editor-in-chief of Taylor &amp; Francis’ erstwhile <em>International Journal of Tourism Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>For several years before Lee took the helm at <em>IJTR</em>, his research — on topics like the “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212571X21000512?via%3Dihub">the economic value of urban forest parks</a>” and the “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.2477">influence of historical nostalgia on a heritage destination’s brand authenticity</a>” — received a small, but steady, trickle of citations in the journal he now oversees.</p>



<p>In 2024, that trickle became a gushing river.</p>



<p>A Retraction Watch analysis of data from Clarivate’s Web of Science shows that of the 186 papers the <em>IJTR </em>published that year, 134, or nearly three-fourths, cited Lee’s work, often multiple times. The editor’s outsize influence continued through 2025 and has held up so far this year as well. Excluding self-citations, a total of 55% of the papers published in <em>IJTR </em>from 2024 until today contain references to Lee’s research. That’s a “staggering” number, according to <a href="https://docenti.unisi.it/en/albertobaccini">Alberto Baccini</a>, a colleague of Bimonte at the University of Siena, who studies publication metrics. Baccini said he had not seen a similar citation pattern at any other journal.</p>



<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/27812986"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27812986/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="visualization" /></noscript></div>



<p>When first reached for comment, Lee told us that, “because the journal has been in transaction [sic] for a couple of years, the stat figures are not particularly stable or objectively reliable.”</p>



<p>“Just do not judge numbers based on a very subjective sample population over a short period of time,” he added.</p>



<p>After we sent him our full analysis, Lee explained that since he was “one of the very few editors of top-tier academic journals in the tourism discipline,” he had been invited to give lectures at “many mainland Chinese universities.”</p>



<p>“Over the last 2 to 3 years, half of all submitted papers came from China, and many were of high quality and suitable for publication,” he added. “Although I do NOT tell them to do so in an invited lecture, there was a strong myth among many Chinese researchers that, to be accepted, they had to cite papers published by the journal&#8217;s editor, and many papers published by Chinese authors cited my articles.”</p>



<p>A Wiley spokesperson told us the publisher is aware of the concerns about citation patterns at <em>IJTR</em>. Wiley has “introduced an additional layer of screening in this journal to evaluate papers before proceeding to publication,” the spokesperson said by email. “We are working closely with the editor-in-chief to ensure that best practices are being followed.”</p>



<p>Many of the authors who cited Lee are indeed based in China, often at Lee’s own institution, the Web of Science data show. But dozens work in other countries, including South Korea, United States, Malaysia, England and Turkey. All told, 107 of the 218 citing papers, or 49%, published from 2024 until today do not include an author in China.</p>



<p>Baccini said because the citations go to Lee’s work, wherever it may be published, the editor is the primary beneficiary, “not the journal.” While there is no evidence Lee coerced anyone to cite his work, Baccini added, such “evidence is nearly impossible to obtain because peer review is a completely secret process. Unless authors come forward to declare they were pressured to cite the editor-in-chief, the scientific community remains in the dark.”</p>



<p>For <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4tx7FRYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Juan Gabriel Brida</a>, an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15221970/homepage/editorialboard.html">editor at <em>IJTR</em></a> and an economist at Universidad de la República in Montevideo, Uruguay, Bimonte’s email became the last straw. He resigned on February 20 over what he called Lee&#8217;s “poor management” of the journal. Lee “doesn&#8217;t involve other members of the editorial board, and articles sit for over a year before receiving reviews,” Brida told us.</p>



<p>Lee did not comment on Bimonte’s case, but said Brida and another editor who resigned before Bimonte’s email had “their own personal reasons to resign. They are not as fast as I am. I am finalising many papers this month instead of waiting for them to complete the process. Also, I plan to recruit another 5 new associate editors in a couple of months; almost 10 very good candidates worldwide applied. Once they are recruited, we will achieve very good teamwork and harmony among us.”</p>



<p>“I have a monthly meeting with Wiley staff at the end of each month to update and discuss current issues,” Lee added. “There has been a major change to the submission and review system at my journal over the last 12 months, which has also caused delays in the process. The number of submitted papers has almost tripled in the last 3 years.”</p>



<p>According to a machine translation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260223122714/https:/fhtm.must.edu.mo/id-1718/article/view/id-2335.html?locale=zh_CN">a press release</a> from Macau University celebrating Lee’s appointment to editor-in-chief, the professor’s “stated goal” was “to elevate the journal&#8217;s ranking to Q1 in [Clarivate’s Journal Citation Reports] within the next three years, with an impact factor exceeding 10.”</p>



<p>Lee “encourages faculty and students of the Macau University of Science and Technology&#8217;s School of Hotel and Tourism Management to cite IJTR articles as extensively as possible in their academic works and to promote the journal to colleagues and students worldwide,” the press release stated.</p>



<p>To Baccini, the case illustrates what the publish-or-perish mantra has done to science: “This system has transformed the role of editorial boards – and especially editors-in-chief – from gatekeepers for the scientific community into operatives for publishers, rewarded for boosting metrics.”</p>

<p>In a move one research ethics expert called “odd,” a university asked one of its professors to attend a remedial integrity course — despite their “significant concerns” the training would have any impact following findings of misconduct.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/19/faked-heart-papers-retracted-following-ohio-state-investigation/">In 2024</a>, Retraction Watch covered the case of <a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/internal-medicine/govindasamy-ilangovan-phd">Govindasamy Ilangovan</a>, then an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at The Ohio State University. We reported at that time two of his papers were retracted from <em>Heart and Circulatory Physiology</em> at the request of the university, and that university officials had requested a third retraction. Thanks to a public records request, we now have access to the university’s <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20231120-Final-Investigation-Report-Ilangovan_Redacted.pdf">2023 final investigation report</a>, which provides us much more information. </p>



<p>The released material shows a committee of the university’s research integrity officers found Ilangovan responsible for manipulating images in three papers. OSU redacted the total number of images in question, but the investigators deemed it “very concerning.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-134246"></span>



<p>Ilangovan “failed to take any responsibility” for issues with the data, the report reads, and the committee requested he attend the PI Program through Washington University in St. Louis within one year. That program teaches researchers “decision-making skills, good lab leadership and management practices, and basic rules-of-the-road for the responsible conduct of research,” <a href="https://integrityprogram.org/">according to its homepage</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/govindasamy-ilangovan.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="85" height="119" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/govindasamy-ilangovan.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-134250" style="width:150px"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Govindasamy Ilangovan</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>In 2022, 14 months before the report was finalized, Ilangovan requested the misconduct proceedings be terminated “without an admission,” according to the document. Despite being shown “overwhelming evidence that there were serious issues” with his papers, Ilangovan maintained the validity of his papers’ conclusions.</p>



<p>“The primary concern for a scientist should be the integrity of the published research record and in these circumstances, the voluntary retraction of the questioned publications would be expected,” the research integrity officers wrote. They expressed “significant concerns that additional training will have a meaningful impact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>C.K. Gunsalus, an expert on university research misconduct, told us sending someone to remedial training makes sense for “certain kinds of problems that are, in fact, remedial: recordkeeping, some supervision practices, compliance issues, time management, etc.” We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/06/08/poll-should-researchers-guilty-of-misconduct-go-to-rehab/">reported</a> in 2016 a three-day “researcher rehab” had a “lasting impact” on scientists with shortcomings like these, with the “vast majority” changing how they work in the lab.</p>



<p>Although she called OSU’s research integrity committee &#8220;diligent in the investigation itself,&#8221; Gunsalus said &#8220;it&#8217;s pretty odd that they&#8217;re saying we have concerns about this person&#8217;s commitment to fundamental integrity and so we think he ought to get management and logistics help.”</p>



<p>The committee &#8220;seems to have made some judgments and then flinched at the consequences,” said Gunsalus, Director of the National Center for Principled Leadership &amp; Research Ethics and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Booker, OSU’s director of media and public relations, told us Ilangovan is no longer affiliated with the university and would not comment further on the personnel matter. An email sent to Ilangovan’s OSU email address bounced back, and he did not respond to a message sent to his LinkedIn profile.</p>



<p>A representative for Washington University told us they could neither confirm nor deny whether Ilangovan attended the remedial program, because “clients and all information related to study participation is strictly confidential.” Similarly, Booker would not comment on whether Ilangovan attended the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the PI training, the OSU investigation committee recommended a three-person OSU panel review all Ilangovan’s data for grants and papers for three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Ilangovan’s two now-retracted papers had a <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.91507.2007_COR">correction</a> in 2021 for a figure that was “inaccurate because of the reuse and relabeling,” as we previously reported. The recently obtained investigation report indicates Ilangovan falsified data in that correction.</p>



<p>The identity of the third paper OSU said should be retracted, as well as details of the investigation pertaining to the article, are redacted from the report. However, footnotes in both the 2022 <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20220907-Final-Inquiry-Report-Ilangovan_Redacted.pdf">preliminary inquiry</a> (which we also obtained through a public records request) and the final 2023 investigation report cite a December 2019 PubPeer comment, and only one of Ilangovan’s papers has drawn a PubPeer comment matching that description: a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-abstract/111/1/74/1744883">2016 article</a> appearing in <em>Cardiovascular Research.</em> The <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05C0671222DAAB88141BC447719CA6">anonymous commenter</a> pointed out possible “[d]uplicate images representing different experimental groups.” </p>



<p>Booker did not respond when we asked whether the university requested retraction of the <em>Cardiovascular Research</em> paper. Tomasz Guzik, the editor-in-chief of the journal, also did not respond when we asked if he had heard from the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three papers together cite just shy of $1 million in National Institutes of Health grant funding given to Ilangovan. He told the investigating committee the grants were cited in the two retracted papers “just to describe the use of some equipment and other resources of the funded projects as used to carry out the experiments,” according to the 2022 inquiry report.</p>



<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-ohio-state-university-decided-go-public-about-misconduct">we reported in <em>Science</em></a> that, following criticisms about transparency failures, OSU proactively released materials about another researcher guilty of misconduct. In that case, the committee recommended the retraction of eight papers.</p>
