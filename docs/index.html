<p>When you look at retracted papers, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/02/men-women-retractions-gender-teams/">you find more men than women among the authors. </a>But more papers are authored by men than women overall. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2025.101682">recent study</a> comparing retraction rates, not just absolute numbers, among first and corresponding authors confirms that men retract disproportionally more papers than women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, published May 20 in the <em>Journal of Informetrics</em>,<em> </em>is the first large-scale study using the ratio of men’s and women’s retraction rates, said study coauthor Er-Te Zheng, a data scientist at The University of Sheffield. The researchers also analyzed gender differences in retractions across scientific disciplines and countries.</p>



<p>Zheng and his colleagues examined papers from a <a href="https://www.leidenranking.com/information/data">database</a> of over 25 million articles published from 2008 to 2023, about 22,000 of which were retracted. They collected the reasons for retraction from the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/retraction-watch-database-user-guide/">Retraction Watch Database</a>, and used several software tools to infer each author’s gender based on name and affiliated country.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132237"></span>



<p>“The biggest limitation is gender inference,” Zheng said. The researchers couldn’t determine gender of the first authors of 47.1% of the retracted papers and 23.3% of the non-retracted papers. The software tools the authors used draw on historical Western-based name databases, which do not account for nonbinary authors or those from non-Western countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether looking at first authors or corresponding authors, men had an overall higher overall rate of retraction than did women, but the researchers found no difference when looking at papers retracted due to mistakes. However, men had higher rates of retraction for misconduct, especially plagiarism and authorship issues.</p>



<p>“The difficulty from all these studies, when we say that men are committing more misconduct than women, is what do we have to do?” said Evelyne Decullier, a methodologist at Hospices Civils de Lyon in France who <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2021.1988576">examined gender differences in retractions within health sciences</a> in a study published in 2021. “We need to understand what is behind that.”</p>



<p>Among the 10 countries with the most retracted articles, among first authors, men had a higher retraction rate than women in Iran, Pakistan, and the United States. Women had higher retraction rates in China and Italy, though the researchers noted that the data from China needs further validation, as over 80% of the authors with unidentified gender were affiliated with Chinese institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Men had higher retraction rates in biomedical and health sciences, and life and earth sciences. These results align with prior studies, said Ana Catarina Pinho-Gomes, a public health consultant at University College London who conducted <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284403">a similar 2023 study focusing on retractions within biomedical sciences</a>. In contrast, Zheng and his colleagues found that women retracted papers at a higher rate in mathematics and computer science.</p>



<p>While the study was descriptive and cannot address the reason for this result, the authors have a hypothesis. “There may be some cultural and expectational differences in this field that women are historically underrepresented in,” Zheng said. “This may create some pressure or expectation for female researchers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to pressures at the author level, “perhaps there is a bias in the evaluation process that leads to female authors having their work scrutinized more closely,” said Mariana Ribeiro, a postdoctoral researcher at Brazil’s National Cancer Institute who has <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/frma.2023.1064230">examined gender differences in self retractions</a>. (She is also a <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/2025/05/27/meet-the-first-two-retraction-watch-sleuths-in-residence/">Sleuth in Residence</a> at the Center for Scientific Integrity, the parent nonprofit of Retraction Watch). Alternatively, “we cannot disregard the possibility that women may be more reluctant to self-correct or to accept corrections to their work, fearing negative repercussions that could also be amplified by existing gender biases.”</p>

<p>Would you pay $169 for an introductory ebook on machine learning with citations that appear to be made up?</p>



<p>If not, you might want to pass on purchasing <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-97-9914-5"><em>Mastering Machine Learning: From Basics to Advanced</em></a>, published by Springer Nature in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on a tip from a reader, we checked 18 of the 46 citations in the book. Two-thirds of them either did not exist or had substantial errors. And three researchers cited in the book confirmed the works they supposedly authored were fake or the citation contained substantial errors.</p>



<span id="more-132235"></span>



<p>“We wrote this paper and it was not formally published,” said Yehuda Dar, a computer scientist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, whose work was cited in the book. “It is an arXiv preprint.” The citation incorrectly states the paper appeared in<em> IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</em>.</p>



<p>Aaron Courville, a professor of computer science at Université de Montréal and coauthor on the book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262035613/deep-learning/"><em>Deep Learning</em></a>, was correctly cited for the text itself, but for a section that “doesn&#8217;t seem to exist,” he said. “Certainly not at pages 194-201.” And Dimitris Kalles of Hellenic Open University in Greece also confirmed he did not write a cited work listing him as the author.</p>



<p>The researcher who emailed us, and asked to remain anonymous, had received an alert from Google Scholar about the book, which cited him. While his name appeared on multiple citations, the cited works do not exist.</p>



<p>Nonexistent and error-prone citations are a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41032-5">hallmark of text generated by large language models like ChatGPT</a>. These models don’t search literature databases for published papers like a human author would. Instead, they generate content based on training data and prompts. So LLM-generated citations might look legitimate, but the content of the citations might be fabricated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The book’s author, Govindakumar Madhavan, asked for an additional “week or two” to fully respond to our request for comment. He did not answer our questions asking if he used an LLM to generate text for the book. However, he told us, “reliably determining whether content (or an issue) is AI generated remains a challenge, as even human-written text can appear ‘AI-like.’ This challenge is only expected to grow, as LLMs … continue to advance in fluency and sophistication.”</p>



<p>According to his bio in the book, Madhavan is the founder and CEO of SeaportAi and author of about 40 video courses and 10 books. The 257-page book includes a section on ChatGPT that states: “the technology raises important ethical questions about the use and misuse of AI-generated text.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Springer Nature provides <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/policies/book-publishing-policies#:~:text=AI%20Policies%20and%20Guidance">policies and guidance</a> about the use of AI to its authors, Felicitas Behrendt, senior communications manager for books at the publisher, told us by email. “Whilst we recognise that authors may use LLMs, we emphasise that any submission must be undertaken with full human oversight, and any AI use beyond basic copy editing must be declared.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Mastering Machine Learning </em>contains no such declaration. When asked about the potential use of AI in the work, Behrendt told us: “We are aware of the text and are currently looking into it.” She did not comment on efforts taken during Springer Nature’s editorial process to ensure its AI policies are followed.</p>



<p>LLM-generated citations were at the center of controversies around Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s <a href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/make-america-healthy-again-report-citation-errors">“Make America Healthy Again” report</a> and a CDC presentation on the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/cdc-vaccine-adviser-thimerosal-presentation">vaccine preservative thimerosal</a>. At Retraction Watch, our cofounders <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/03/04/kpmg-government-report-on-research-integrity-makes-up-reference-involving-retraction-watch-founders/">were once cited in a made-up reference</a> in an Australian government report on research integrity.&nbsp; We’ve seen fake citations fell <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/12/paper-rejected-for-ai-fake-references-published-elsewhere-with-hardly-anything-changed/">research</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/05/20/journal-taking-corrective-actions-after-learning-author-used-chatgpt-to-update-references/">articles</a>, and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/">our list of papers</a> with evidence of undisclosed ChatGPT use has grown long and almost certainly represents <a href="https://dbrech.irit.fr/pls/apex/f?p=9999:1::::::">only a fraction</a> of those that actually do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same day Behrendt replied to our query, Springer Nature published a post on its blog titled, “<a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/the-source/blog/blogposts-research-integrity/research-integrity-scholarly-books/27780154">Research integrity in books: Prevention by balancing human oversight and AI tools</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;All book manuscripts are initially assessed by an in-house editor who decides whether to forward the submission to further review,” Deidre Hudson Reuss, senior content marketing manager at the company, wrote. “The reviewers – subject matter experts – evaluate the manuscript’s quality and originality, to ensure its validity and that it meets the highest integrity and ethics standards.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Science</em> has changed an expression of concern on a 2022 paper to an erratum after removing one of the coauthors — who was found to have committed misconduct — and allowing the researchers to repeat experiments.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1633">Structural basis for strychnine activation of human bitter taste receptor TAS2R46</a>,” has been cited 68 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two months after publishing the article in September 2022, <em>Science </em>issued an editorial <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf8367">expression of concern,</a> stating a post-publication analysis had found one figure with “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/22/science-paper-on-sense-of-taste-gets-expression-of-concern-as-university-investigates/">potential discrepancies</a>.”</p>



<span id="more-132220"></span>



<p>The authors worked with “outside experts” to repeat aspects of the experiment, Meagan Phelan, communications director for <em>Science</em>, told us. They “repeated bioluminescence energy transfer experiments” that were the basis for two of the article’s figures, one of which was the focus of the 2022 expression of concern, the new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx9419">2025 notice states</a>. </p>



<p>“The new data did not provide strong functional support” for the previous work related to those figures, and the “conclusions on precoupling are weaker than in the original version,” the erratum states. However, “the editors remain confident in the key findings of the paper,” according to the notice. Both figures were removed from the corrected study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked why <em>Science</em> did not retract the paper, Phelan told us instead of retracting “a study where conclusions still stand, we worked with the author team.”  Guidelines from the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> “argue against a partial retraction and make the point that the main goal is correction of the literature rather than a mechanism to punish the authors,” she added. </p>



<p>The erratum also says Xiaoling Cao was removed as an author. At the time the paper was published, Cao’s listed affiliation was with iHuman Institute, which is part of ShanghaiTech University in China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phelan told us the authors discovered Cao had “committed misconduct” during the original study and was responsible for the removed aspects of the paper, so “no longer qualified for authorship.” She said Cao “has since left” ShanghaiTech. For further details Phelan referred us to the university, which has not responded to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Cao did not respond to our request for comment and is not listed as a researcher on the iHuman Institute’s website. The corresponding authors, Zhi-Jie Liu and Tian Hua, also did not respond to our request for comment.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-16-at-4.07.08%E2%80%AFPM-768x305.png" alt="" style="width:300px"/></figure></div>


<p>Two Swedish agencies have closed their investigations into a high-profile research center at Chalmers University of Technology that was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/05/16/lack-of-permits-selective-data-halt-research-at-swedish-prosthetics-research-center/">suspended last year</a> for “shortcomings in the operations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Center for Bionics and Pain Research (CBPR), known for its work on restoring limb function, was scrutinized and ultimately shut down <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/research-at-the-centre-for-bionics-and-pain-research-is-suspended-and-deficiencies-are-reported-to-regulatory-authorities/">after a university investigation last April found</a> scientists at the center conducted research without sufficient permits, had inadequate quality assurance processes and handled sensitive personal data poorly, and found “shortcomings” in legal agreements for the center’s operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, subsequent investigations by the country’s Medical Products Agency, which regulates medical devices and clinical trials, and the Ethics Review Appeal Board have ended, with both agencies declining to pursue further action.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132213"></span>



<p>“[Chalmers] found no punctual evidence of misdoing, but only what they conveniently thought could be wrong, but not factually wrong,” Max Ortiz-Catalán, the founder and former director of CBPR, wrote to <em>Retraction Watch</em>. “No research was conducted purposely wrong.” </p>



<p>Ortiz-Catalán left the center in 2023 amid what a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/05/16/lack-of-permits-selective-data-halt-research-at-swedish-prosthetics-research-center/">university representative described as “issues in his leadership</a>.” In his email, he also criticized the university for failing to consult the researchers involved or provide an opportunity to respond during its internal review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Chalmers’ senior leadership has “full confidence” in the work of the ethics committee that ran the review, and contends that the committee spoke to “a number of the researchers involved,” according to Anders Palmqvist, Chalmers’ vice president of research and sustainable development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chalmers declined to comment on the Swedish agencies’ decisions and has closed its own investigation into CBPR.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Chalmers’ <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/C-2024-0495-EOK-rapport.pdf">initial review</a> into the center examined 50 publications linked to Ortiz-Catalán, finding 30 ethical approvals. But the university had noted it was “generally a problem” to link the approvals to individual studies because the publications did not cite registration numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether the papers had appropriate ethical approval was the main focus of the subsequent investigation by the Swedish Ethics Review Appeal Board. The board brought in Kjell Asplund, a professor emeritus of medicine and a former scientific secretary of the body, to evaluate 15 publications Chalmers had reported as suspect, but in his view, hadn’t been “really scrutinized” until then, he told us in an email.</p>



<p>Of the nine studies that fell under Sweden’s Ethics Review Act – which requires prior approval for research that may physically or mentally affect human subjects – eight had obtained the necessary approval. But according to Asplund, the documentation of that approval was either “absent or very confusing.” In some cases, incorrect registration numbers were cited. “It seems likely that this contributed to the suspicion of fraud,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ortiz-Catalán said he and his colleagues published about 60 peer-reviewed articles with many ethical approvals involved. “It&#8217;s not surprising that such an amount of work can be confusing for an external person,” he told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asplund identified one “questionable” study for which no ethics approval had been obtained. Whether this was a violation of the ethics act would depend on whether the non-invasive device used in the research was intended to physically or mentally affect the participants. “I left that to the law experts,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ethics Review Appeal Board <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eqiwjdyunYUHWxUovcuV6HiwEBQbMlNI/view?usp=sharing">ultimately concluded</a> none of the studies in question violated ethics law. “Either the studies had ethical review approval, or such approval was not required,” the chairman, Anita Linder, told us in an email. Linder continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It should be noted that the Appeals Board only dealt with the issue of potential violations of the Ethical Review Act. Whether the research at the Centre violates other legislation or if there have been deviations from good research practices is not within the Appeals Board&#8217;s mandate to investigate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Chalmers’ initial review had also located only one regulatory permit from the Swedish Medical Products Agency since CBPR was established, dated June 20, 2023. The review noted that Ortiz-Catalán and his colleagues had presented research results related to the device in question at a conference in Colombia on June 4-8, 2023 — suggesting a clinical trial had taken place ahead of the necessary approvals for the medical device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This became the subject of two separate investigations by the Swedish Medical Products Agency. In a decision last August, the agency found that the clinical trial had not yet begun, and the investigator in question – Ortiz-Catalán – had since left the institution. With no evidence that the trial had begun before approval, the agency <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TyhZ0HWE9F7R8rYWupPzT147-0g7Nbb4/view?usp=sharing">chose not to investigate further</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that decision was made public, the agency then received more reports suggesting other potentially unauthorized clinical trials had taken place at CBPR. In a second review, the agency took a closer look at the conference presentation, ultimately finding that those results “appeared to be from another study.”</p>



<p>The Medical Products Agency also identified another six studies with ethical approval that had not been reported to the Medical Products Agency — despite their likely needing such review before commencing. Whether those studies had begun, or were ever completed, remained unclear, the Medical Products Agency stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Medical Products Agency <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KNJ7Ba1MoRn48m896PkWMjDKuIrOW5PT/view?usp=sharing">ultimately wrote off the case</a>, citing the fact CBPR had ceased operations and no new studies were under way. Representatives from the agency have not responded to requests for comment on the decision. This month, drug inspector Daniel Bjermo <a href="https://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/lakemedelsverket-lagger-ner-arende-om-chalmersforskning-.9565ac1b-f8b5-406a-94f0-426c04bd82b2">told a local Swedish paper</a> the agency “was not justified to investigate the matter further as the desired effect had already been achieved.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked whether he felt the Medical Products Agency’s finding was a full vindication, Ortiz-Catalán told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Again, no evidence has been ever presented that there were any violations to the law regarding medical devices. However, Chalmers and the media ran a story of systematic wrongdoing judging us before anything was proven, and not a single case was actually proven. The damage is done and those who caused it, including the media, know what they did. I need no vindication. Hundreds of people have benefited from my work… and that&#8217;s what matters to me and what I continue doing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When we reported on this story last year, Ortiz-Catalán was working at a bionics institute in Australia. Now, he says he is doing humanitarian work in Ukraine and continues to be “engaged in research projects around the world.” </p>



<p>He specifically took issue with our coverage last year because we reported on Chalmers’ findings, which he says have not been substantiated by external agencies. He said our article caused harm to his students and staff at CBPR. “Please consider the evidence instead of unsubstantiated rumors,” he wrote. </p>



<p>When asked, he did not explicitly deny there was any wrongdoing at the center, but said no research was conducted “purposely wrong” and that “no other academic research group in Sweden had done more to maintain compliance with the law” for medical devices. </p>

<p>“Not a single case was proven so neither by Chalmers nor the national agencies who assessed the matter,” he said. “If violations have been happening systematically, there should be tons of evidence, right?”</p>



<p>The original investigation had also found that the center had no person in charge of compliance, and that personal data had been handled poorly. These points do not seem to have been addressed by either Swedish agency, and Ortiz-Catalán continues to maintain there’s “no evidence” for these points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the finding of shortcomings in legal agreements, “what are the ethical or legal violations here exactly?” he asked.&nbsp; “More importantly, how does this relate to scientific misconduct? These are all empty and at best inconsequential allegations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palmqvist, Chalmers’ VP of research, told <em>Retraction Watch</em> the relevant agencies “have made their decisions,” and the university would not be reviewing or commenting on the decisions. Chalmers has closed its own investigation into CBPR and does not anticipate any further decisions from external authorities, he said.&nbsp;</p>
