<p>A journal has retracted a 22-year-old-paper whose first author is the integrity officer for the Committee on Publication Ethics over concerns about image editing that “would not be acceptable by modern standards of figure presentation.”</p>



<p>The 2003 paper, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165603002050">A recombinant H1 histone based system for efficient delivery of nucleic acids</a>,” was published in Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Biotechnology </em>and has been cited 41 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. </p>



<p>Sleuth Sholto David, who goes by the name “Mycosphaerella arachidis” on PubPeer, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F641C30E468EF1D4FF11F445B204C6">raised concerns</a> about the image in December 2023, pointing out a “[d]ark rectangle” that appeared to be “superimposed onto the image.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132187"></span>



<p>Coauthor <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.drcrisanti">Andrea Cristani</a>, a professor at the Imperial College of London in England, responded on forum the same month, noting he was “not involved in in [sic] performing the experiments I have asked the person who produced the data to provide an explanation [sic].”</p>



<p>The first author of the article, <a href="https://publicationethics.org/about/who-we-are/cope-team">Iratxe Puebla</a>, is the facilitation and integrity officer for COPE, an organization publishers and journals often turn to for retraction standards. She is also the director for DataCite’s Make Data Count, an initiative “focused on open research data assessment metrics,” according to its <a href="https://datacite.org/make-data-count/">website</a>. The 2003 paper listed her affiliation at the time as Imperial College London.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165625000550">retraction notice</a>, Puebla agreed with the decision and conceded “there appears to be evidence of splicing.” The “step would have been taken with the intention of providing a clearer presentation of the findings,” the notice reads.</p>



<p>Puebla did not respond to our multiple requests for comment sent to her work email, or to a message on LinkedIn. COPE said they are “are not able to comment on specific cases without having a thorough understanding of the facts” and did not respond directly to our request for additional ways to contact Puebla.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hcemm.eu/teams/infectious-diseases-with-special-emphasis-on-co-morbidities/circulating-nucleic-acid-biomarker-core-group/group-leader/">Christoph Sensen</a>, the editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Biotechnology</em>, told us concerns about the paper were raised in January 2024 by a reader and investigated internally. He requested the retraction after authors on the paper failed to produce original data and declined to re-perform the experiment, he said. In a March <em>For Better Science</em> post, Leonid Schneider said he had contacted Sensen with concerns about the paper. Sensen did not say whether David or Schneider were the first to contact the journal. </p>



<p>Sensen attributed the discovery to advances in image technology. When the paper appeared, “it was printed in 8 bit. Now we have 16 bit and 32 bit imagery,” he said, which revealed the black box with two gel bands.</p>



<p>Sensen suspected the researchers “took two gels, one was darker than the other and they just cut out a piece from one gel and blotted it into the other one with Photoshop.”</p>



<p>“Even after 20 years, these things may just surface now which were hidden from sight before,” Sensen told us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2025/06/23/interesting-papers-on-vip-interneurons-in-cortex-and-hippocampus/">Interesting papers on VIP interneurons in cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interneurons are inhibitory neurons in the brain that are thought to shape the computations performed by principal cells. The effects of inhibition can be rather diverse, depending on which neurons &#8211; or which parts of a neuron (dendrites, soma, or the axon hillock) &#8211; are targeted. A particularly interesting inhibitory motif that is the <em>disinhibitory </em>motif, which depends on a specific interneuron type known as VIP neuron. VIP neurons primarily inhibit another interneuron type called SST neurons (also written as &#8220;&#8216;SOM&#8221;), which in turn inhibits principal or pyramidal cells, often by targeting their dendrites. Therefore, activating VIP neurons releases pyramidal neurons from SST-mediated inhibition, possibly creating a window for plasticity and learning.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, both VIP and SST neurons are not homogeneous classes but consist of multiple subtypes which might also vary across cortical and neocortical areas. Below, I’ll highlight a few recent studies on VIP neurons that caught my attention. Let me know if you know others that are similarly interesting!</p>



<p><strong>A role for hippocampal VIP neurons in place cell remapping</strong></p>



<p>In this well-designed and easy-to-read paper, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.01.636072v1">Neubrandt, Lenkey et al. (2025)</a> from the <a href="https://vervaeke-lab.org/">Vervaeke lab</a> investigate how VIP neurons in the hippocampus contribute to place cell remapping. Place cell remapping is a form of hippocampal plasticity where pyramidal cells change their spatial firing fields in response to environmental novelty.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.01.636072v1">Neubrandt, Lenkey et al.</a> use optogentic tools to activate (ChrimsonR) and inactivate (ArchT) VIP neurons while performing calcium imaging of pyramidal neurons. They find that inactivation decreases remapping and activation increases remapping of pyramidal neurons. The effects are relatively subtle but seem convincing, and align with the idea that VIP neurons facilitate plasticity by disinhibiting pyramidal neurons. </p>

<p>The authors additionally analyze their data with respect to a specific plasticity rule in pyramidal cells termed behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (<a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2023/09/18/interesting-papers-on-behavioral-timescale-synaptic-plasticity-experiments/">covered before</a> on this blog), which results in a more complex picture that is less straightforward to interpret. The authors conclude that in addition to VIP activity other factors (e.g., neuromodulatory input) may be necessary to induce remapping.</p>



<p>Overall, this study nicely shows how novelty activates VIP interneurons to help control plasticity in pyramidal neurons, presumably via SST neurons. Their findings are consistent with and extend previous results from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.01.009">Turi et al. (2019)</a> that demonstrated a necessary role of VIP neurons for reward location learning in hippocampal place cells.</p>



<p><strong>The subtypes of VIP neurons in neocortex</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.26.640383v2">Dellal, Zurita et al. (2025)</a> from <a href="https://www.rudyneurolab.org/">Bernardo Rudy’s lab</a> investigate subtypes of VIP neurons in neocortex (somatosensory cortex). They do so in a very systematic study with transgenic animal crossing strategies that enable identification of various subtypes. I really do not want to know how much work it was to cross and validate all these mouse lines! As a result, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.26.640383v2">Dellal, Zurita et al.</a> find four subtypes of VIP neurons.</p>



<p>The most distinctive feature of these subtypes is whether the protein CCK is expressed or not. CCK-negative VIP neurons and in particular CCK-negative CR-positive VIP neurons target mostly SST neurons, while CCK-positive VIP neurons target also pyramidal cells directly and are there not only disinhibitory but also inhibitory for pyramidal cells. It is interesting that very similar findings have been made earlier for hippocampal circuits, where two such subtypes of VIP neurons were found in the 1990s (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00609-5">Acsády et al., 1996</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-10-03397.1996">Gulyás et al., 1996</a>).</p>

<p>With the increasingly refined functional classification of interneuron subtypes, it becomes more and more difficult to not get confused by the different classification approaches. Other studies (e.g., in Figure 7 by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.09.013">Geiller et al., 2020</a>) used slightly different markers to delineate VIP subclasses, making it quite a puzzle to connect the dots between publications!</p>



<p>A detail that I found particularly interesting as somebody <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01612-8">working</a> on the noradrenergic system is the following finding: CR-positive VIP neurons, which target SST neurons but not pyramidal neurons, were not significantly activated by bath-applied noradrenaline (Fig. 6M,N); this is suprising because I would have expected noradrenalin to have a disinhibitory effect on the local circuit and therefore to act via VIP-CR interneurons – which does not seem to be the case. CCK-positive VIP cells as well as CCK-negative CR-negative VIP neurons (the fourth class found by the authors) were, however, activated by noradrenaline. So maybe all the disinibitory action through noradrenaline goes through CCK-negative CR-negative neurons? This definitely needs more follow-up experiments. I would be very curious to see these same experiments done in hippocampus …</p>

<p>The main take-away from this paper is quite clear: perturbations of VIP neurons using transgenic VIP lines do affect multiple subtypes with partially opposing signature, with both disinhibitory effects (via CCK-negative interneurons) and inhibitory effects directly on pyramidal cells (via CCK-positive interneurons). This confound from using VIP transgenic lines is also discussed by the above study of <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.01.636072v1">Neubrandt, Lenkey et al., (2025)</a>. Targeting interneurons more specifically seems essential for future studies to manipulate or replicate the disinhibitory effect of (a subset of) VIP neurons, in neocortex as well as in hippocampus.</p>



<p><strong>Hippocampal interneurons with all-optical methods</strong></p>



<p>In an beautiful technical achievement, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.20.644347">Yang et al. (2025)</a> from <a href="https://elsc.huji.ac.il/people-directory/faculty-members/yoav-adam/">Yoav Adam’s lab</a> provide a systematic study of the functional characteristics of different neuron types in hippocampus (principal cells, VIP, SST, PV). They combine 1P voltage imaging (with the voltage sensors somArchon1 and QuasAr6b) and optogenetic activation of the same neurons (somCheRiff) to both record and manipulate specific neurons in vivo. Pretty cool! I liked how they focused on recording from and perturbing only very few neurons at a time, but at a apparently high quality.</p>

<p>To describe these results, the authors analyze how optogenetic depolarization as well as state (walking vs. quiet) influences several cellular characteristics: the response to input, the amplitude of theta oscillations, and &#8211; for pyramidal neurons &#8211; the bursting propensity.</p>



<p>In a second step, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.20.644347">Yang et al.</a> use modeling to better interpret these descriptive findings. These single-cell conductance-based models are interesting to consider and consistent with the experimental results. However, I believe that the data itself and its pure description remain the strongest part of the paper. Such a dataset with voltage recordings and perturbations of several cell types in hippocampus would have been difficult to imagine just 10 or 15 years ago. I sincerely hope that the dataset will be curated and shared openly during the publication process!</p>

<p>A journal will not retract a paper linking use of talc-based baby powder to cancer, despite legal pressure from the pharmaceutical giant that made the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lawyer representing a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson in May asked editors of the <em>Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</em> to retract <a href="https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2020/01000/Mesothelioma_Associated_With_the_Use_of_Cosmetic.3.aspx">a paper on cases of mesothelioma associated with cosmetic talc</a>, following the court-ordered release of the identities of the people described in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawyer alleged many of the patients had other exposures to asbestos than cosmetic talc, rendering the article’s fundamental claims “false.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132161"></span>



<p>The journal evaluated the allegations according to guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics and found the author’s reply, also delivered via a lawyer, “satisfactory,” according to a decision letter seen by Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article “will not be altered or changed, the publication will stand, and therefore we consider this matter closed,” Paul Brand-Rauf, the journal’s editor, told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The legal system usually protects the identity of research participants, but the mesothelioma case series is different because the patients were plaintiffs in lawsuits about their disease, said <a href="https://schachtmanlaw.com/">Nathan A. Schachtman</a>, a lawyer who has represented defendants in product liability litigation but who is not involved in this case. He has obtained underlying data for a published paper by subpoena in the past, he said, but the data remained under a protective order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stuff like this does happen,” he said. “It’s a little different, but it rhymes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The paper, “<a href="https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2020/01000/Mesothelioma_Associated_With_the_Use_of_Cosmetic.3.aspx">Mesothelioma Associated With the Use of Cosmetic Talc</a>,” was published in January 2020. It has been cited 30 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Corresponding author Jacqueline Moline of Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y., has also referenced the article in expert testimony for plaintiffs in talc litigation, as well as in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110311/witnesses/HHRG-116-GO05-Wstate-MolineJ-20191210.pdf">remarks before Congress</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moline and her coauthors identified “33 cases of malignant mesothelioma among individuals with no known asbestos exposure other than cosmetic talcum powder,” according to the abstract. Each case had been referred to Moline “for medico-legal evaluation as part of tort litigation.” The authors gathered data from the patients’ medical records and sworn testimony from their lawsuits, the paper stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LTL Management, a <a href="https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/ltl-update">subsidiary</a> Johnson &amp; Johnson formed to handle its liability for cosmetic talc litigation – a strategy subbed the “<a href="https://www.rmlawcall.com/johnson-johnson-talc-litigation-latest-developments-and-implications#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9CTexas%20Two%2DStep%E2%80%9D,on%20all%20talc%2Drelated%20liabilities.">Texas Two-Step</a>” by critics – <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/24/jj-subsidiary-alleges-fraud-in-paper-that-linked-cosmetic-talc-with-mesothelioma/">previously alleged</a> some patients described in the publication had other exposures to asbestos after the identity of one was disclosed in the course of litigation.</p>



<p>In May 2023, Moline published an <a href="https://journals.lww.com/joem/fulltext/2023/05000/mesothelioma_associated_with_the_use_of_cosmetic.28.aspx">erratum</a> to the article, stating she had identified a “single case” that “should not have been included in the manuscript” because the patient had smoked cigarettes with asbestos-contaminated filters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This error does not negate the other 32 cases, in which no other source of asbestos was present apart from cosmetic talcum powder,” Moline wrote in the erratum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same month as the erratum was published, LTL <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1-LTL-Moline-original-complaint.pdf">sued Moline</a> in New Jersey federal court for product disparagement, fraud and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125">making false statements</a> in advertising. The company alleged five patients in the article had other exposures to asbestos based on matching their characteristics to known plaintiffs, but did not have data to confirm their identities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June 2024, a judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/40-LTL-Moline-dismissal-opinion.pdf">dismissed</a> the case, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<p>The content of Dr. Moline’s statements, considered alongside their context and verifiability, supports a finding that her statements in both the 2020 Article and in other media are nonactionable “tentative scientific conclusions” protected by the First Amendment.</p>



<p>LTL has appealed the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In April, Pecos River Talc, a successor to LTL, filed a motion to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/47-1-PR-allegations.pdf">reopen the case</a> due to “new evidence”: the company had prevailed in a legal battle with Northwell Health to acquire the identities of all the individuals described in the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company acquired the document through a subpoena issued for another lawsuit, which Moline and Northwell <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/153220_2024_DR_JACQUELINE_MOLINE_v_JOHNSON_JOHNSON_et_al_PETITION_1.pdf">fought to block</a> in New York state court. A state Supreme Court judge <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/153220_2024_DR_JACQUELINE_MOLINE_v_JOHNSON_JOHNSON_et_al_DECISION___ORDER_ON_41.pdf">ruled in favor</a> of Moline and Northwell last June, but a panel of judges <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/153527_2024_Johnson_Johnson_et_al_v_Northwell_Health_Inc__NOTICE_OF_ENTRY_87.pdf">reversed the decision</a> in October upon Johnson &amp; Johnson’s appeal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The judges deemed the names of the individuals described in the article were not protected by <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/education-and-outreach/about-research-participation/protecting-research-volunteers/principal-regulations/index.html">federal regulations</a> on clinical research or patient privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The law protecting the privacy of medical records <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2794032">doesn’t shield them from law enforcement</a>, said <a href="https://medresearch.umich.edu/profile/1737/kayte-spector-bagdady">Kayte Spector-Bagdady</a>, director of Michigan Bioethics. </p>



<p>Participants in research funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are typically protected from requests or warrants from law enforcement or a court under Certificates of Confidentiality, Spector-Bagdady said, but such protections “are not absolute”: In 2004, a court <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2694567/">allowed a confidential reading</a> of some study documents from Duke.</p>



<p>Moline and her coauthors did not receive any federal funding for their article, but researchers in the past have been able to apply for a Certificate of Confidentiality for non-federally funded projects. The Certificate of Confidentiality <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/human-subjects/coc/for-research-not-funded-by-nih">system</a> went down under the Trump administration, Spector-Bagdady said, with a message on its website stating “an update will be provided by July 2025.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After further litigation, a New York Supreme Court judge in March <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/47-7-order-to-disclose.pdf">ordered</a> Moline and Northwell to turn over the list of names to Johnson &amp; Johnson.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The document identifying the patients “proves that the statements in the Article are false and that the Article is nothing more than a made-for-litigation attempt to distort the literature with something posing as ‘science’ to support the plaintiff bar’s tort claims in the talc litigation,” Pecos River’s lawyers wrote in their argument to reopen their suit against Moline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The suggestion that Dr. Moline and her multiple co-authors would jeopardize their careers and reputations by fabricating research data, deceiving both Northwell and medical journals in the process—an allegation Pecos River makes with no evidence—is absurd,” Kevin Marino, Moline’s lawyer, wrote in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/48-Moline-response.pdf">response</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In May, Pecos River also wrote to the journal, pressing the editors to retract the article “no later than May 15, 2025,” according to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PR-letter-to-JOEM.pdf">copy of the letter</a> Marino filed in court, along with his <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Moline-reply-to-JOEM.pdf">rebuttal</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the editors did not retract, “Pecos River will be compelled to seek the appropriate judicial relief,” lawyer Kristen Renee Fournier wrote on behalf of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But journal editors Stacieann Yuhasz and Paul Brandt-Rauf informed Fournier they would not retract the article in a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/FINAL-Response-letter-to-Pecos-Talc-re-Moline-June-3-2025.pdf">letter</a> dated June 3, which Marino shared with us in response to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to Fournier for comment, and received a statement from Erik Haas, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s worldwide vice president for litigation, who said the company “disagree[s] with the Journal’s decision not to retract the article or issue a corrective statement to address the numerous egregious misstatements that Dr. Moline made in her article. Fabricated articles serve only to pollute the pool of scientific literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We intend to bring these issues to light in the pending legal actions against Dr. Moline,” Haas added.</p>

<p>Twenty journals lost their impact factors in this year’s Journal Citation Reports, released today, for excessive self-citation and citation stacking. Nearly half of the journals on the list are from well-known publishers MDPI, Sage, Springer, Taylor &amp; Francis and Wiley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clarivate releases the annual <a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-funding-analytics/journal-citation-reports/">Journal Citation Reports</a> each June. For the first time, the company <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/05/15/clarivate-journal-impact-factor-retracted-articles-web-of-science/">excluded citations to retracted papers</a> when calculating this year’s impact factors. Amy Bourke-Waite, a communications director for Clarivate, told Retraction Watch this change affected 1% of journals, none of which lost impact factors in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many institutions use the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/07/14/impact-factor-science-journals/">controversial metric</a> as an indicator of journal quality. And suppressing a journal’s impact factor can have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/06/when-a-journal-is-delisted-authors-pay-a-price/">negative effects</a> on the publication and the authors who publish papers in it.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132145"></span>



<p>In 2024, Clarivate suppressed <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manipulation/">17 impact factors</a>, a substantial increase from <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/28/truly-devastating-four-journals-wont-get-new-impact-factors-this-year-because-of-citation-shenanigans/">2023’s four</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company suppressed four journals this year for citation stacking, which it defines as two or more journals citing each other at an “<a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/dlm_uploads/2025/06/JCR-Reference-Guide-2025.pdf">unusually high rate</a>.” The rest lost their impact factor for self-citation, when a journal has “an unusually high percentage” of citations to itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to the publishers of all the journals on the suppression list and heard back from representatives for 10 of them.</p>



<p>Sami Sajjadifar, the CEO of Sami Publishing Company in Ilam, Iran, which publishes <em>Chemical Methodologies</em>, told us the decision to suppress the journal’s impact factor was “very wrong and dangerous.” He said <em>Chemical Methodologies</em>’ impact factor was suppressed because of how often they were cited by another journal on the list, <em>Applied Organometallic Chemistry. </em>According to Sajjadifar, 17% of all citations from <em>AOC </em>were to <em>Chemical Methodologies</em> papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In correspondence seen by us in which he contested the decision, Sajjadifar mentions “genuine scientific overlap in research scope” between material in the journals. He credited the citations to “breakthroughs in green organometallic methodologies and homogeneous catalysis” in recent years and denied any ties to <em>AOC</em> or Wiley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley, which publishes <em>Applied Organometallic Chemistry,</em> noted Clarivate “makes no accusation of wrongdoing” when suppressing a journal’s impact factor, and that the company is “disappointed in the decision.” An internal investigation “found no integrity issues,” said the spokesperson, who told us Wiley appealed the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laura West, a public affairs manager for Sage, told us an “investigation is currently underway” to address citation concerns with the journal <em>Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Marieke Cambeen, executive vice president of Springer Nature’s Springer portfolio, said the publisher was looking into five of its journals that did not receive impact factors this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark Robinson of Taylor &amp; Francis said the publisher was investigating <em>Mechanics of Advanced Materials and Structures</em> “before Clarivate notified us about their decision.”</p>



<p>The other journals with suppressed impact factors did not immediately respond to our request for comment or asked for additional time to respond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is the full list of journals:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Update, June 22, 2025: We received additional comments from publishers after this story was published. </em></p>



<p><em>Ali Jawarneh, editor-in-chief of the </em>Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering<em>, tells us the journal will be “introducing stricter editorial checks on citation practices.”</em></p>



<p><em>And a spokesperson for MDPI notes the publisher took over the </em>Journal of Mind and Medical Sciences <em>in 2025, “and therefore, content published under MDPI’s editorial oversight was not included in this assessment,” the spokesperson said by email. “We also wish to reassure the scientific community that, since the transfer, key indicators, such as those related to self-citations, are already demonstrating a positive and improving trend.”</em></p>

<p>Wiley has issued a mass correction at one of its journals after finding nearly 100 papers with undisclosed conflicts of interest related to submissions by board members and relationships between authors and journal editors.</p>



<p>An investigation found conflict of interest issues in 98 papers published from 2020 to 2025 in <em>Geological Journal</em>, although the issues may have gone on before then, sleuths suggest. Nearly a third of the papers shared a single co-author — an associate editor at the journal.</p>



<p>That editor&#8217;s contract was not renewed, we have learned.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gj.5230">correction notice</a>, issued in early May, the journal had not taken “measures to manage potential conflicts of interest between authors and editors” for 98 articles. </p>



<span id="more-132141"></span>



<p>A spokesperson for Wiley told us their investigation “uncovered that editors of the journal, who were also authors publishing in the journal … had not disclosed their position as members of the Editorial Board at the submission stage.” The journal currently lists 29 associate editors.</p>



<p>Wiley’s research integrity team “independently re-evaluated” the peer review process and content of each article, the correction states. As a result of the investigation, the journal amended the conflict of interest statement on each of the 98 affected articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked Wiley about what precedent a correction, rather than retraction, might set for other researchers. The spokesperson said the role as a publisher is “to investigate the content of the papers in question and take the appropriate action for the situation.” They also noted the inquiry turned up “no evidence” results in the papers were compromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of those papers, <a href="http://www.geosciencefrontiers.com/news/413">M. Santosh</a> co-authored 32. The name may be familiar to Retraction Watch readers: Last year, Santosh was involved in an instance of “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/23/elsevier-investigating-geology-journal-after-allegations-of-pal-review/">pal review” at a geology journal</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santosh has listed affiliations in recent papers at Kochi University in Japan and China University of Geosciences in Beijing. He is also a “Highly Cited Researcher” with more than 1,600 published articles, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. His papers have been cited over 70,000 times, 12,000 of which are self-citations. Until the correction was published, he was also an <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0A969F4CF1BA3A17D9D716D29677BA">associate editor</a> at <em>Geological Journal</em>.<em> </em>According to the Wiley spokesperson, Santosh did not disclose his position as a member of the editorial board at the submission stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we asked why Santosh was no longer listed on the editorial board, a spokesperson for Wiley told us the journal “did not renew the contract of an editorial board member who had repeatedly submitted manuscripts without COI statements identifying his role on the Editorial Board.”</p>



<p>Santosh said he was unable to comment as a “public university employee working in China.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Geological Journal </em>published the 98 papers between 2020 and 2025, which the Wiley spokesperson called a “realistic timeframe during which we can more reliably retrace what happened.” The spokesperson also noted that around that time, both the publisher and the “scholarly publishing industry more broadly speaking began strengthening policies” for editorial conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, several undisclosed conflicts of interest at the journal took place before 2020, as detailed in a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/05912EE2947A2433249AC4B62BCB6D">PubPeer comment</a> posted by “Desmococcus antarctica.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite these apparent conflicts of interest, the spokesperson said the investigation “did not find any paper mill activity” associated with the articles and each paper underwent a “substantive” post-publication review by the research integrity team. The review included “manual review by our research integrity team of each article, reviewer report, and author response,” the Wiley spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A sleuth who has asked to remain anonymous got in touch with us regarding this case. The sleuth said several of the papers to which the correction applied were “extreme” cases of conflicts of interest. These included papers where authorship relationships existed between the paper author, editor and reviewer, as detailed in another Desmococcus <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/42F812FCE41661F101869CF8ED2419#2">PubPeer comment</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/CAF799A0F4FDD982FF7D6A6AC6C30E">another example</a>, Li Tang, who is Santosh’s <a href="https://www.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CDFD&amp;dbname=CDFDLAST2017&amp;filename=1017126690.nh&amp;uniplatform=OVERSEA&amp;v=iZ5uC57E5h7aAbsZenTlD1Rm9b80GOJCJMzjEBFX1jnTApTdfWcNmSMY6DJTjGvG">former Ph.D. student</a>, served as Santosh’s handling editor while coauthoring another paper in the journal within the same timeframe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guidance from the Committee on Publication Ethics <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/flowchart/undisclosed-conflict-interest-published-article">on the topic states</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>A published article might need to be corrected or retracted, depending on whether the editor considers the conflict of interest to have affected the peer review process or the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“We have additionally taken proactive steps to reinforce COI best practices with editorial teams,” the Wiley spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>
