                <p>On this week's Journal Club session, Ohki Katakura will talk about his work in the talk entitled &quot;How the cerebellum recognises learnt and novel patterns: computational approach with a biologically detailed network model&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The cerebellum is essential for motor control, timing and cognition. Although its anatomy
and physiology have been investigated, recent experimental studies raise new open
questions. These include how the granule cells process mossy fibre signals and how the
Purkinje cells code learnt and novel patterns. In this research, a detailed cerebellar
cortex network model was constructed by incorporating existing models [1,2] and
introducing long-term depression at granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses. The network
connectivity switches between the oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity states,
affecting the sparsity of activated granule cells. Pattern recognition criteria differed
across these states: in the oscillatory network, novel prompted longer pauses in Purkinje
cell spikes, while the non-oscillatory network responded with longer bursts. The number of
storable patterns in the network corresponds to the sparsity of activation.</p>

<p>A journal is retracting a paper on the purported harms of vaccines against COVID-19 written in part by authors who have had similar work retracted before.</p>



<p>The article, “<a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/203052-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-lessons-learned-from-the-registrational-trials-and-global-vaccination-campaign#!/">COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines: Lessons Learned from the Registrational Trials and Global Vaccination Campaign</a>,” appeared late last month in <em>Cureus</em>, which used to be a stand-alone journal but is now owned by Springer Nature. (It has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cureus/">appeared frequently in these pages</a>.)</p>



<p>Graham Parker, Director of Publishing and Customer Success at <em>Cureus</em>, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I can confirm we will be retracting it by the end of the week, as we have provided the authors with a deadline to reply and indicate whether they agree or disagree with the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The senior author on the work was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_A._McCullough">Peter McCullough</a>, a cardiologist at the Institute of Pure and Applied Knowledge who lost his board certification after the American Board of Internal Medicine <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23242430-abim-decision-on-mccullough">found</a> he had “provided false or inaccurate medical information to the public.”</p>



<span id="more-128774"></span>



<p>Indeed, McCullough had already lost one <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/25/covid-19-vaccine-myocarditis-paper-to-be-permanently-removed-elsevier/">paper</a>, in <em>Current Problems in Cardiology</em>, from Elsevier, when he and his colleagues submitted their latest opus to <em>Cureus</em>. And SSRN, which hosts preprints for <em>The Lancet</em>, another Elsevier journal, had <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4496137">removed work by him and colleagues</a> claiming large numbers of deaths from COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days after the paper appeared, we asked John Adler Jr., the editor in chief of <em>Cureus</em>, if the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/25/covid-19-vaccine-myocarditis-paper-to-be-permanently-removed-elsevier/">track record </a>of the authors concerned him. His response seemed to admit to the risk, but he also defended the journal’s vetting of the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Yes I am aware that many of these authors are skeptical zealots when it comes to the dangers of vaccines. Our editorial response was extra vigilance during the peer review process with 8 different reviewers weighing in on publication or not, including a few with strong statistics knowledge. Therefore, a credible peer review process was followed and the chips fell where they may. That is all I can say. If you or other readers were to note fatal flaws in this article now that it is published, i.e. failure to accurately report financial COIs [conflicts of interest], totally erroneous statistical analysis, fake data etc. we will of course re-evaluate at any time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adler then took a jab at other journals:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The decision process Cureus made, contrasts sharply with Elsevier’s seeming editorial decision to just censor the article using ad hominem concerns.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In a Feb. 9, 2024 letter to the journal and the publisher, <a href="https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-jpm2003">John P. Moore</a>, a microbiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, and <a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/gregg-gonsalves/">Gregg Gonsalves</a>, an epidemiologist at Yale School of Public Health, in New Haven, Conn., expressed their “serious concerns” about the article. Among their objections:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors utterly lack relevant professional qualifications that would enable them to assess the scientific publications they draw on and/or attempt to criticize. The authors self-describe their affiliations under the rubric of “Independent Research”, or list private foundations, or in one case report an academic discipline unrelated to biology. In short, the authors cannot draw on years of training in biological science, but appear to be self-taught via the “University of Google”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They continue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The point here is that the Cureus review merely regurgitates claims about mRNA vaccines that have circulated on the internet and been debunked over and over again, including by fact-checking organizations (e.g., Factcheck.org, and the USA Today and Politico factcheck teams).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They conclude:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By bringing this highly problematic review to your attention, we hope that you will conduct a thorough review of how it was accepted for publication in Cureus under the Springer Nature imprimatur. How appropriate was the peer review process? How did the editor act? Is the acceptance of this review symptomatic of a wider problem at the journal? Finally, if you share our views that this review is so flawed as to be dangerous to public health, you may well decide that it should be retracted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Springer Nature had apparently been looking into the case already, and ended up agreeing with Moore, Gonsalves and other critics of the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Steve Kirsch, a co-author of the paper, announced the retraction <a href="https://kirschsubstack.com/p/our-paper-critical-of-the-covid-vaccines">on his Substack </a>over the weekend:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The paper I co-authored with 6 other authors will be retracted by the journal because the publisher won’t allow any paper that is counter-narrative to be published.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Kirsch’s post, Springer Nature’s inquiry found:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>a significant number of concerns with your article that in our view can’t be remedied with a correction. The concerns include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>We find that the article is misrepresenting all-cause mortality data</li>



<li>We find that the article appears to be misrepresenting VAERs data</li>



<li>The article states that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine saved two lives and caused 27 deaths per 100,000 vaccinations, and the Moderna vaccine saved 3.9 lives and caused 10.8 deaths per 100,000 vaccinations, though there does not appear to be convincing evidence for this claim.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Incorrect claim: Vaccines are gene therapy products.</li>



<li>The article states that vaccines are contaminated with high levels of DNA. Upon review we found that the cited references are not sufficient to support these claims.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The article states that SV40 promoter can cause cancer because SV40 virus can cause cancer in some organisms and inconclusively in humans. However, we find that this is misrepresenting the cited study (Li, S., MacLaughlin, F., Fewell, J. <em>et al.</em> Muscle-specific enhancement of gene expression by incorporation of SV40 enhancer in the expression plasmid. <em>Gene Ther</em> 8, 494–497 (2001). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.gt.3301419">https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.gt.3301419</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>The article states that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines did not undergo adequate safety and efficacy testing, which the journal considers to be incorrect</li>



<li>The article incorrectly states that spike proteins produced by COVID-19 vaccination linger in the body and cause adverse effects.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>



<p>Waving the white flag, a bowed but unbroken Kirsch wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It doesn’t do any good to show them these reasons are all bogus. The laundry list of items is simply a placeholder to make it look like the journal is following the science.</p>



<p>Nothing we can say on appeal will make any difference.</p>



<p>The decision was made to retract the paper and facts don’t matter. It’s about supporting the narrative. When they write “in our view can’t be remedied with a correction” it means “don’t even bother arguing with us, your paper is retracted.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For his part, Moore said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal and publisher responded courteously and professionally to our letter, and I was pleased by the final outcome. They did what needed to be done.</p>
</blockquote>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weight-loss-drug-addiction-opioid-disorder">Taking a weight-loss drug reduced a craving for opioids</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>DENVER — </strong>A weight-loss drug used to treat obesity and diabetes has shown promise to treat another disorder: opioid addiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early results from a small clinical trial, presented February 17 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, suggest that a close relative of the weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic significantly lessened cravings for opioids in people with opioid use disorder.</p>



<p>“For them to have any time when they might be free of that craving seems to be very hopeful,” Patricia “Sue” Grigson, a behavioral neuroscientist at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey said at the conference.&nbsp;The vast majority of drug overdose deaths in the United States are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/overdose-prevention-opioid-safe-injection-harm-reduction">due to opioids</a> (<em>SN: 2/14/24</em>).</p>



<p>The drug, called liraglutide, mimics a hormone called GLP-1 that the body releases after people eat. Wegovy and Ozempic — brand names for semaglutide, a molecule that induces weight loss more effectively than liraglutide — also imitate the hormone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unclear exactly how the drugs work when it comes to weight loss, but researchers think such GLP-1 dupes prompt the body and brain to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs-2023">make people feel full</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/23</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are hints that such drugs could work for addiction, too. People taking Wegovy or Ozempic have reported lessened desire for not just food but also alcohol and nicotine. What’s more, Grigson and colleagues showed in a previous study in rats that liraglutide can cut down on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wegovy-ozempic-treat-addiction">heroin-seeking behavior,</a> perhaps by changing the animals’ brain activity (<em>SN: 8/30/23</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To test whether liraglutide might work in people as a treatment for opioid addiction, Grigson and colleagues gave the drug to volunteers being treated for opioid use disorder at the Caron Treatment Center in Wernersville, Pa. The team analyzed data from 20 people, 10 of whom were slated to receive increasing drug doses over 19 days. The remaining 10 people received a placebo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At higher doses of liraglutide, patients dropped out of the trial largely due to gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, a known side effect of these drugs. Still, the treatment began reducing opioid cravings at the lowest dose, Grigson said, and desire for opioids was reduced by 30 percent overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s equivalent to the effect of about 14 days of intensive treatment at a residential center, Grigson said.</p>



<p>The results need to be confirmed in larger trials, she said. The team also hopes to try out other GLP-1 drugs, which may be more effective and come with fewer side effects, and include people with different levels of addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-ignition-first">Here’s how scientists reached nuclear fusion ‘ignition’ for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of nuclear fusion’s biggest advances wouldn’t have happened without some impeccable scientific artistry.</p>



<p>In December 2022, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California created fusion reactions that produced an excess of energy — a first. In the experiment, 192 lasers blasted a small chamber, setting off fusion reactions — in which smaller atomic nuclei merge to form larger ones — that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-energy">released more energy than initially kicked them off</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/22</em>). It’s a milestone known as “ignition,” and it has been decades in the making.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have released details of that experiment in five peer-reviewed papers published online February 5 in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> and <em>Physical Review E</em>. The feat demanded an extraordinary level of finesse, tweaking conditions <em>just so </em>to get more energy out of the lasers and create the ideal conditions for fusion.</p>



<p>The work is “exquisitely beautiful,” says physicist Peter Norreys of the University of Oxford. Norreys, who was not involved with the research, compares the achievement to conducting a world-class orchestra: Different elements of the experiment had to be meticulously coordinated and precisely timed.</p>



<p>Scientists also discovered a long-predicted heating effect that could expose the physics of other violent environments, such as exploding stars called supernovas. “People say [physics is] a dry subject,” Norreys says. “But I always think that physics is at the very forefront of creativity,”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The road to nuclear fusion’s big break</h2>



<p>Fusion, the same process that takes place in the sun, is an appealing energy source. Fusion power plants wouldn’t emit greenhouse gases. And unlike current nuclear fission power plants, which split atomic nuclei to produce energy, nuclear fusion plants wouldn’t produce dangerous, long-lived radioactive waste. Ignition is the first step toward harnessing such power.</p>



<p>Generating fusion requires extreme pressures and temperatures. In the experiment, the lasers at LLNL’s National Ignition Facility pelted the inside of a hollow cylinder, called a hohlraum, which is about the size of a pencil eraser. The blast heated the hohlraum to a sizzling 3 million degrees Celsius — so hot that it emitted X-rays. Inside this X-ray oven, a diamond capsule contained the fuel: two heavy varieties of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium. The radiation vaporized the capsule’s diamond shell, triggering the fuel to implode at speeds of around 400 kilometers per second, forming the hot, dense conditions that spark fusion.</p>

<p>Previous experiments had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">gotten tantalizingly close to ignition</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/21</em>). To push further, the researchers increased the energy of the laser pulse from 1.92 million joules to 2.05 million joules. This they accomplished by slightly lengthening the laser pulse, which blasts the target for just a few nanoseconds, extending it by a mere fraction of a nanosecond. (Increasing the laser power directly, rather than lengthening the pulse, risked damage to the facility.)</p>



<p>The team also thickened the capsule’s diamond shell by about 7 percent — a difference of just a few micrometers — which slowed down the capsule’s implosion, allowing the scientists to fully capitalize on the longer laser pulse. &nbsp;“That was a quite remarkable achievement,” Norreys says.</p>



<p>But these tweaks altered the symmetry of the implosion, which meant other adjustments were needed. It’s like trying to squeeze a basketball down to the size of a pea, says physicist Annie Kritcher of LLNL, “and we’re trying to do that spherically symmetric to within 1 percent.”</p>



<p>That’s particularly challenging because of the mishmash of electrically charged particles, or plasma, that fills the hohlraum during the laser blast. This plasma can absorb the laser beams before they reach the walls of the hohlraum, messing with the implosion’s symmetry.</p>



<p>To even things out, Kritcher and colleagues slightly altered the wavelengths of the laser beams in a way that allowed them to transfer energy from one beam to another. The fix required tweaking the beams’ wavelengths by mere angstroms — tenths of a billionth of a meter.</p>



<p>“Engineering-wise, that’s amazing they could do that,” says physicist Carolyn Kuranz of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved with the work. What’s more, “these tiny, tiny tweaks make such a phenomenal difference.”</p>



<p>After all the adjustments, the ensuing fusion reactions <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.109.025204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yielded 3.15 million joules of energy</a> — about 1.5 times the input energy, Kritcher and colleagues reported in <em>Physical Review E</em>. The total energy needed to power NIF’s lasers is much larger, around 350 million joules. While NIF’s lasers are not designed to be energy-efficient, this means that fusion is still far from a practical power source.</p>



<p>Another experiment in July 2023 used a higher-quality diamond capsule and obtained an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-dreamed-of-nuclear-fusion">even larger energy gain</a> of 1.9, meaning it released nearly twice as much energy as went into the reactions (<em>SN: 10/2/23</em>). In the future, NIF researchers hope to be able to <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/article/50756/enhanced-capability-proposal-aims-boost-ignition-yield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase the laser’s energy from around 2 million joules up to 3 million</a>, which could kick off fusion reactions with a gain as large as 10.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next for fusion</h2>



<p>The researchers also discovered a long-predicted phenomenon that could be useful for future experiments: After the lasers heated the hohlraum, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.065104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was heated further</a> by effects of the fusion reactions, physicist Mordy Rosen and colleagues report in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Following the implosion, the ignited fuel expanded outward, plowing into the remnants of the diamond shell. That heated the material, which then radiated its heat to the hohlraum. It’s reminiscent of a supernova, in which the shock wave from an exploding star <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/30-year-anniversary-supernova-1987a">plows through debris</a> the star expelled prior to its explosion (<em>SN: 2/8/17</em>).</p>



<p>“This is exactly the collision that’s happening in this hohlraum,” says Rosen, of LLNL, a coauthor of the study. In addition to explaining supernovas, the effect could help scientists study the physics of nuclear weapons and other extreme situations.</p>



<p>NIF is not the only fusion game in town. Other researchers aim to kick off fusion by confining plasma into a torus, or donut shape, using a device called a tokamak. In a new record, the Joint European Torus in Abingdon, England, <a href="https://euro-fusion.org/eurofusion-news/dte3record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generated 69 million joules</a>, a record for total fusion energy production, researchers reported February 8.</p>



<p>After decades of slow progress on fusion, scientists are beginning to get their atomic orchestras in sync.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-retrovirus-myelin-speedy-nerves-evolve">Ancient viruses helped speedy nerves evolve</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient viruses have really gotten on our nerves, but in the best of ways.</p>



<p>One particular retrovirus — embedded in the DNA of jawed vertebrates — <a href="https://cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00013-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helps turn on production of a protein</a> needed to insulate nerve fibers, researchers report February 15 in <em>Cell</em>. Such insulation, called myelin, may have helped make speedy thoughts and complex brains possible.</p>



<p>The retrovirus trick was so handy, in fact, that it showed up many times in the evolution of vertebrates with jaws, the team found.</p>



<p>Retroviruses — also known as jumping genes or retrotransposons — are RNA viruses that make DNA copies of themselves to embed in a host’s DNA. Scientists once thought of remnants of ancient viruses as genetic garbage, but that impression is changing, says neuroscientist Jason Shepherd, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re finding more and more that these retrotransposons and retroviruses have influenced the evolution of life on the planet,” says Shepherd, of the University of Utah Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine in Salt Lake City.</p>



<p>Remains of retroviruses were already known to have aided the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-genes-play-big-role-what-makes-us-human">evolution of the placenta</a>, the immune system and other important milestones in human evolution (<em>SN: 5/16/17</em>). Now, they’re implicated in helping to produce myelin.</p>



<p>Myelin is a coating of fat and protein that encases long nerve fibers known as axons. The coating works a bit like the insulation around an electrical wire: Nerves sheathed in myelin can send electrical signals faster than uninsulated nerves can.</p>



<p>Coated nerve fibers can also be thinner and grow longer than they would without insulation, enabling animals to grow bigger, says Robin Franklin, a stem cell biologist at Altos Labs-Cambridge Institute of Science in England. And, he says, thinner fibers can be packed into the nervous system more efficiently.</p>



<p>“As a result of myelin, brains became more complex and vertebrates became more diverse,” Franklin says. “If myelination hadn&#8217;t happened in early vertebrate evolution, we wouldn&#8217;t have the whole galaxy of vertebrate diversity that we see now.”</p>



<p>Franklin and colleagues went digging in previously collected data for evidence of jumping genes, particularly those that may influence myelin production. They hit paydirt in data on the cells that wrap nerves in myelin: The team found high levels of RNA from an ancient retrovirus.</p>



<p>That RNA, dubbed <em>RetroMyelin</em>, does not have instructions for making a protein itself. Rather, the team found, the RNA latches on to a protein called SOX10, and together they turn on production of myelin basic protein, which zips myelin into a tight sleeve around nerve cells.</p>



<p>When the researchers then used a genetic trick to reduce amounts of <em>RetroMyelin </em>in rat brains, zebra fish and frogs, production of myelin basic protein dropped. That finding suggests that <em>RetroMyelin</em> RNA is important for making myelin.</p>



<p>Other retrotransposons have shaped evolution by creating new switches in the genetic control panels of certain genes or by producing new versions of proteins that regulate activity of genes, says Eirene Markenscoff-Papadimitriou, a developmental neuroscientist at Cornell University who was not involved in the research. But producing RNA to influence activity of a gene is a new trick. The finding is “a very surprising and important demonstration … of a new type of developmental process being made possible by these retroviruses,” she says.</p>



<p>Organisms with vertebrae and jaws, including fish, amphibians and mammals, have <em>RetroMyelin</em>, but lampreys and other jawless fish and invertebrates don’t. While that would seem to suggest that the retrovirus jumped into the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates, that doesn’t appear to have been the case.</p>



<p>The team found that each species they examined had its own version of <em>RetroMyelin</em>, rather than related versions with some minor changes. That pattern suggests the retrovirus infected multiple species at different times yet resulted in the same outcome, a concept known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-genes-dolphins-and-bats-evolved-same-way-allow-echolocation">convergent evolution</a> (<em>SN: 9/6/13</em>).</p>



<p>It isn’t clear why lampreys and other jawless vertebrates don’t have <em>RetroMyelin</em>. One possibility is that the viruses don’t infect lampreys, says study coauthor Tanay Ghosh, a computational biologist at Altos Labs. Or it could be that the viruses did invade lampreys but weren’t evolutionarily useful and have been lost.</p>



<p>For the jawed vertebrates, Markenscoff-Papadimitriou says, having myelin basic protein and other components necessary for myelin production already in place may have been important to take advantage of <em>RetroMyelin</em>.&nbsp;“We&#8217;re getting infected constantly, and some of these [viruses] are conferring evolutionary advantage.” Scientists are seeing the success stories in which <em>RetroMyelin</em> probably immediately gave an advantage to the host organism and was kept, she says.</p>



<p>Usually, researchers are interested in genes and RNAs that produce proteins. They filter out noncoding RNAs — ones like <em>RetroMyelin</em> that don’t produce proteins, Markenscoff-Papadimitriou says. But, she notes, scientists are increasingly recognizing that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-molecules-crucial-roles-human-health-disease">noncoding RNAs also do important jobs</a> (<em>SN: 4/7/19</em>). “This paper will be an inspiration to other developmental biologists to really mine their data to look for the retrotransposons.”</p>

<p>One of the <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/B-7291-2009">most highly cited</a> authors in engineering has continued publishing after his death more than a year ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jiří Jaromír Klemeš, a researcher at the Brno University of Technology in the Czech Republic and a top editor at an Elsevier journal that has come under fire for author self-citation, is listed as a coauthor of at least <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Klemes-Posthumous-Articles-Sharing-Sheet1.pdf">49 papers</a> published since <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652623011721">his death in January 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the articles do not mention that Klemeš is deceased. Whether they should have is not entirely clear. Publishers and journals aren’t consistent about the protocol following the death of a research collaborator –&nbsp; a lack of consistency that has even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2013/09/24/ask-retraction-watch-how-should-deceased-colleagues-be-credited-in-papers/">stirred up some debate</a> among our own readers in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the 49 papers we found posthumously listing Klemeš as a coauthor, 27 fail to mention his death. <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Ji%C5%99%C3%AD+Jarom%C3%ADr+Kleme%C5%A1">Commenters on PubPeer</a> have spotted several of these instances and queried them without a meaningful response from the surviving authors. </p>



<span id="more-128766"></span>



<p>One commenter <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/4DBA6AB259D2110243E9AC8B8FB9F0#7">pointed out</a> that <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/13/4976">a paper Klemeš revised and published in June 2023</a> had a note acknowledging all authors had read and agreed to the contents of the published manuscript. “The current statement is factually incorrect for obvious reasons,” the commenter wrote. (The paper was submitted in May 2023, months after Klemeš’ death, but it is possible it had been completed before he died and submitted elsewhere first, or that it simply wasn’t submitted to the journal that published it for some months.)</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While it’s not clear how common deceased authorship is in the wider scientific community, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273783">one study</a> looking at the biomedical field found the phenomenon has been on the rise since the year 2000.</p>



<p>The reasons behind this “burgeoning trend” are unclear, according to the study. While surviving authors may often want to acknowledge a deceased colleague’s contributions, giving authorship to a dead researcher could have ulterior motives, such as boosting a paper’s chances of getting published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vast majority of Klemeš’ posthumous papers are in titles published by Elsevier, including the two journals with the highest number of publications that did not cite the researcher’s death: <em>Energy</em> and the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>.</p>



<p>In response to our queries to <em>Energy</em>, a spokesperson from Elsevier wrote that the publisher does not have a policy for acknowledging the death of a coauthor. Klemeš confirmed coauthorship for eight of the 14 publications in <em>Energy</em>, according to the spokesperson. For the six that were submitted after his death, two confirmed his coauthorship in the acknowledgements and one was confirmed by a statement from another author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are in the process of obtaining statements of co-authorship for the remaining 3 papers,” the email continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An editor at the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em> said they would carefully check all the papers about which we inquired. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Until his death, Klemeš was a subject editor at <em>Energy</em> and a co-editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/">As we’ve reported previously</a>, the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em> was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-JCR-Editorial-Expression-of-Concern-FINAL-SENT-1-2.pdf">mentioned in an expression of concern from Clarivate</a>, a journal-indexing service, for a disproportionately high number of self-citations – adding up to more than 11,000 out of 47,000, or about a quarter, of the documented references.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Petar Sabev Varbanov, a frequent collaborator of Klemeš and a co-author or editor of 17 of the posthumous publications, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Klemeš, who was the head of the research center <a href="https://sustainable-pi.com/about-spil-2/">Sustainable Process Integration Laboratory</a> (SPIL), was regularly included in “highly cited” leaderboards, <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/B-7291-2009">earning the title from Clarivate</a> in 2020, 2022 and 2023. In previous years, he also was listed as a top reviewer and handling editor. Speaking at a conference in Malaysia in 2016, he <a href="https://youtu.be/bryIcIkp16M?si=AslF7dcR1sH4IPXH&amp;t=355">joked that he reviewed 16 papers</a> in the lunch break alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade ago, we wrote about a researcher who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/04/03/late-resveratrol-researcher-dipak-das-manages-to-revise-and-publish-paper-from-the-grave/">appeared to have submitted revisions to a manuscript after his death</a>. Back then, the journal argued that since he contributed to the manuscript, his name should be kept as an author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among Klemeš’ posthumous papers, the ones that did explicitly flag his death either included a note in the acknowledgments dedicating the paper to his memory or a dagger symbol (†) next to his name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the journals’ authorship guidelines, such acknowledgment doesn’t seem to be necessary most of the time. Elsevier does not have explicit instructions about deceased authors, but <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/researcher/author/policies-and-guidelines">broadly notes authorship</a> “should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution or interpretation of the reported study.”</p>



<p>Springer Nature, also among the publishers of Klemeš’ posthumous papers, says <a href="https://www.springer.com/kr/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/before-you-start#:~:text=For%20cases%20in%20which%20a,could%20be%20a%20direct%20relative.'">coauthors should obtain approval</a> from a representative to include the deceased author. The American Chemical Society, another one of the publishers, <a href="https://publish.acs.org/publish/author_guidelines?coden=jacsat#:~:text=Deceased%20persons%20who%20meet%20the,official%20titles%20or%20academic%20degrees.">states the deceased person</a> should be included with a note indicating the date of death – a directive followed by one of the two papers published by the society.</p>



<p>There’s no clear consensus either among the nonprofit organizations that help shape best practices in scholarly publishing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authorship criteria <a href="https://icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</a> say authors should give “final approval of the version to be published” – potentially an impossible task for a deceased author, depending on the timing of the publication and the person’s death.&nbsp;The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), on the other hand, has given case-by-case advice. In one instance, the group recommended <a href="https://publicationethics.org/case/deceased-author">adding a footnote</a> about the death and the author’s contribution. In another, <a href="https://publicationethics.org/case/deceased-author-and-author-delaying-publication">it recommended </a>connecting with a surviving partner or the person’s estate to accept the proof.</p>

<p>Mark Jacobson, a Stanford professor who sued a journal and a critic for $10 million before dropping the case, has lost an appeal he filed in 2022 to avoid paying defendants more than $500,000 in legal fees.</p>



<p>As we have <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/09/stanford-prof-ordered-to-pay-legal-fees-after-dropping-10-million-defamation-case-against-another-scientist/">previously reported</a>, Jacobson:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>…who studies renewable energy at Stanford, sued in September 2017 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for defamation over a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722.full">2017 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> (PNAS) that critiqued a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15060.abstract">2015 article</a> he had written in the same journal. He sued PNAS and the first author of the paper, <a href="https://www.vibrantcleanenergy.com/about-us/">Christopher Clack</a>, an executive at a firm that analyzes renewable energy.</p>
</blockquote>



<span id="more-128763"></span>



<p>The fees, based on an anti-SLAPP statute, are “<a href="https://www.medialaw.org/topics-page/anti-slapp">designed to provide for early dismissal of meritless lawsuits filed against people for the exercise of First Amendment rights</a>.” Jacobson tried to argue that, by dropping the suit, he was no longer liable for legal fees because the statute requires that defendants “prevail.”</p>



<p>But the three judges in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals disagreed. Justice Joshua Deahl, <a href="https://www.dccourts.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Jacobson%20v.%20Clack%2022-CV-523.pdf">writing on behalf of himself and colleagues</a>, held:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>under Jacobson’s preferred approach, a plaintiff could engage in harassing and meritless litigation up until the point at which they sense the court might dismiss the case, and then voluntarily dismiss the suit themselves, all the while keeping the threat of refiling hanging over the defendants’ heads and running up their legal bills.</p>



<p>The specter of repeat litigation by Jacobson is not farfetched.&nbsp; In his briefing to this court, Jacobson continues to take issue with “the refusal of Dr. Clack and NAS to correct the false facts to this day, in reckless disregard for the truth.”&nbsp; Much of his brief rehashes his claims that NAS and Clack defamed him and he persists in condemning Clack’s article.&nbsp; In arguing that NAS and Clack have not “prevailed,” Jacobson repeatedly asserts that he retains the ability to refile his defamation suit, “keeping the defendant[s] at risk.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Indeed, Jacobson told us in a statement – available <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jacobson-comments-1.pdf">here</a> – he is “evaluating whether to appeal the DC decision to the full DC Appellate court”:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It appears the court decided to set a precedent, ensuring that future voluntary dismissals before a ruling in similar-type cases would be subject to the risk of a fee award.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the judges’ description of his brief as rehashing the original claims, he said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>With this decision, the court is basically saying that a scientist can falsify or publish with reckless disregard for the truth false definitions or data or even lie in a scientific article with the purpose of harming or defaming another individual or group of individuals, but such actions do not fall under D.C. defamation law because the statement is published in a scientific paper rather than in a newspaper or other public forum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June 2022, Jacobson prevailed on the California Labor Commissioner to order Stanford to pay his own attorneys’ fees because, he argued, bringing the suit was “necessary for my job,” particularly defending his reputation. Stanford’s appeal of that decision, and arguments against paying for the fee awards in the District of Columbia, will be heard at a trial in May.</p>



<p>Commenting more generally on the suit, the judges wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What animates Jacobson’s $10 million defamation suit is nothing more than his indignation at an article critical of his work. Such criticism comes with the territory of academic debate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Such lawsuits can, of course, be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/judge-orders-cancer-researchers-art-collection-seized-to-pay-fees-from-failed-libel-suit/">expensive</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-sample-weight-bennu-asteroid">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx nabbed over 120 grams of space rocks from asteroid Bennu</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s official: NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft snagged 121.6 grams of pristine space rocks when it bopped the asteroid Bennu four years ago, more than double the mission&#8217;s official science goal, <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/osiris-rex/2024/02/15/nasa-announces-osiris-rex-bulk-sample-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the agency confirmed</a> February 15.</p>



<p>Launched in 2016, OSIRIS-REx is NASA’s first mission to collect samples from an asteroid and return them to Earth so scientists can study our solar system’s origins. After performing its grab-and-go procedure from the diamond-shaped Bennu, the spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-return-asteroid-bennu-earth">dropped its canister</a> into our atmosphere last year (<em>SN: 9/22/23</em>). Engineers swiftly shuttled it off to a specially designed sample curation center at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where it was placed in a hermetic glove box to prevent contamination by terrestrial material.</p>

<p>While researchers have been able to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-asteroid-bennu-first-look-sample">analyze some rocks and dust already</a>, weighing the full sample has been delayed by a couple stuck screws that prevented anyone from accessing the entire contents of the capsule (<em>SN: 10/11/</em>23). Some clever workarounds <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/nasas-osiris-rex-curation-team-reveals-remaining-asteroid-sample/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally unlocked the full sample</a> on January 10, and it will now be distributed to scientists around the world for study.</p>



<p>To learn how engineers got the canister open, as well as what kinds of science the sample will teach us, <em>Science News</em> spoke with Harold Connolly, a geologist at Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., who oversees analysis of the material from Bennu. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Shortly after retrieving the OSIRIS-REx canister, you were able to collect some sample, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly:</strong> There was lots of dust on the outside of the canister. That was the first material we got, approximately 1 to 1.1 grams or so of fine dust particles.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> What kinds of problems did you face before you could fully open the main sample container?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly: </strong>There&#8217;s a bunch of fasteners or screws holding the container closed, approximately 32 of them. And two of them we couldn&#8217;t loosen enough with the equipment we had. But there&#8217;s a mylar flap that moves, which trapped the sample in a container. The curation team at the Johnson Space Center figured out it could just push down the flap. Without removing the plate that was stuck, the team could get sample out from inside the TAGSAM [Touch-and-Go-Sample-Acquisition-Mechanism] head by literally pushing down the mylar flap and scooping it out very gently. We got 70 grams of sample — a lot.</p>



<p>But to access the rest of the sample, they had to create a new kind of ratchet wrench screwdriver. The previous screwdriver was starting to flex a little bit, so you might be breaking the screwdriver.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Can you tell me anything about what you’ve found from the sample you have so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly:</strong> It&#8217;s a serpentinite. It&#8217;s an altered rock where the original rocky material has interacted with water, and that original rocky material must have been rich in olivine and pyroxene and some other common rock-forming minerals on Earth, but changed and altered in a beautiful way. That is a geologic puzzle to figure out.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> What have we suspected about the history of Bennu that the sample is helping to confirm?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly:</strong> Oh, there&#8217;s a lot.</p>



<p>Bennu itself is in a configuration that is not what it originally was. Once upon a time, the pieces that became Bennu were in a much different object, probably a heck of a lot bigger. We&#8217;re talking soon after the solar system formed, 4.5 billion years ago.</p>



<p>When that object formed, material came together, brought ices with it — and not just water ice, but carbon monoxide and ammonia ice — which means it had to accrete somewhere out past what we call the snow line, out past Mars in the outer solar system. At that distance from the sun, temperatures are low enough for those ices to form.</p>



<p>Eventually, the interior of the larger, original object started to heat up because of radioactivity that&#8217;s naturally in the material, and that began to melt the ice and become fluid. Fluid began to interact with the parent body to form new minerals — like serpentinite — from the material that accreted.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll be teasing out how much of it was altered, how much is relic from the pre-accretion stage, how much is actually from stars that died and injected dust into our solar system.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>It sounds like a dynamic and complicated history.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly:</strong> We&#8217;re interested in what happened: How did that original parent body change? Was it impacted by another body and smashed apart to create the larger boulders that eventually came together to form Bennu? And how long has Bennu been in this current configuration? How much had it experienced interaction with the sun or with cosmic rays? All these kinds of processes we can tease out by analyzing teeny tiny little bits of sample.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> Do we have any answers to any of these questions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Connolly: </strong>Stay tuned.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mixing-root-microbes-boost-tea-flavor">Mixing up root microbes can boost tea’s flavor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers may have gotten to the root of tea’s soothing effect.</p>



<p>The quality of a cup of chai can be enriched by <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)00079-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modifying the microbial community</a> that populates the plant’s roots, researchers report February 15 in <em>Current Biology</em>. The secret is to inoculate roots with bacteria that boost the synthesis of the amino acid theanine.</p>



<p>There’s something in tea that helps us wind down, says Zhenbiao Yang, a plant cell biologist at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology in China. Some <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.874254/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies suggest</a> that the “chemical that helps you sleep is theanine,” he says. What’s more, theanine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24633359/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infuses tea with umami</a>, a taste often described a savoriness, he says.</p>



<p>Yang and colleagues analyzed the microbial communities inhabiting the roots of two oolong tea plant varieties: a sweet, low-theanine cultivar called maoxie and a cinnamony, high-theanine variety called rougui. On the rougui roots, they found more microbes that metabolize nitrogen, a nutrient tea plants convert into theanine.</p>



<p>The researchers then isolated 21 bacterial strains from rougui roots to concoct an experimental microbial medley, which they called SynCom. They disinfected the roots of seedlings of several tea plant varieties, grew them in sterilized vermiculite soil for a few weeks, and then inoculated soils with live or dead SynCom. They also added a nutrient solution that was either low or high in nitrogen.</p>



<p>After 20 days, Yang’s team found that the addition of live SynCom boosted theanine levels in each of the varieties. The effect was especially pronounced under the lower nitrogen conditions — leaves of maoxie plants inoculated with living SynCom contained almost 0.007 milligrams per gram of theanine, 0.005 mg/g higher than maoxie inoculated with dead SynCom.</p>



<p>The next step will be to refine SynCom to facilitate its production and distribution, Yang says. “If we have only like one or two [strains], it will be really easy.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS is delighted to once again partner with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>. The awards program honors researchers who reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong> in their work. The Einstein Foundation received dozens of stellar submissions. We asked this year&rsquo;s finalists to write about their research in the run up to the ceremony on March 14<sup>th</sup> in Berlin. The is the first in our 5-part series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Flavio Azevedo, <a href="https://www.rug.nl/staff/flavio.azevedo/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assistant Professor&nbsp;of Social Psychology</a>,&nbsp;University of Groningen and his FORRT team (bios below).</p>



<p>Scientific research stands as a beacon of progress and innovation, yet its credibility has been threatened by repeated failure to replicate what had been widely believed. So, how can we ensure the reliability of scientific discoveries? This question lies at the heart of an ambitious project seeking to transform the landscape of scientific research, education, and policy.</p>



<p><strong>The Challenge of Replication in Science</strong></p>



<p>At the core of the scientific endeavor is the ability to accumulate knowledge via replication of studies&mdash;a fundamental yet often overlooked aspect. Replication involves repeating a study and testing a hypothesis under a variety of similar and different conditions to verify its results are reliable. It&rsquo;s a litmus test for the robustness of scientific findings. Despite its importance, replication studies struggle with recognition, are less cited, not yet incentivized, and thus underutilized, leading to a skewed understanding of scientific literature. This has led to situations where studies are widely relied on before later replications show that the proposed effect was not real, or at least not generalizable</p>



<p><strong>A Pioneering Solution: The FORRT Replication Database (FReD) Project</strong></p>



<p>To address these issues, the <a href="https://forrt.org/">Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Teaching</a> (FORRT) has launched an ambitious project aiming to create a comprehensive, dynamic database cataloging scientific claims and subsequent replication attempts across various disciplines of social, cognitive, and behavioral sciences. This living, crowd-sourced collection not only includes replicated studies but also those that failed to replicate, providing a more complete picture of scientific inquiry.</p>



<p><strong>Empowering Researchers and Educators</strong></p>



<p>FORRT&rsquo;s initiative extends beyond mere data collection. It involves developing user-friendly tools like Shiny apps, enabling researchers and educators to explore, visualize, and engage with replication data effectively. These tools will foster critical thinking about the planning, access, and integration of replication efforts in research and education.</p>



<p><strong>Making Science Accessible and Credible</strong></p>



<p>The project is set to revolutionize how we view, evaluate, and utilize scientific data. By making replication studies more accessible and understandable, FReD will empower educators and other stakeholders to incorporate these findings into their teaching and work, promoting discussions on the robustness of published research and reducing reliance on outdated evidence. Researchers will gain a valuable resource for generating new knowledge, and the public will access credible, reliable scientific evidence. The database is open to all and aligns with FORRT&rsquo;s mission to democratize knowledge and higher education resources &ndash; in short, opening up science for everyone.</p>



<p><strong>A Step Towards Transparent, Robust Science</strong></p>



<p>The implications of FORRT&rsquo;s work are profound. By bringing to light the successes and failures of past research, they lay the groundwork for a more transparent, robust, and reproducible scientific process. This is not just about data; it&rsquo;s about building a culture of accountability, transparency, and integrity in scientific research.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the FReD project promises to enhance our pursuit of reliable knowledge. It&rsquo;s a reminder that in science, as in life, understanding our past failures and successes paves the way for a brighter, more informed future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/immune-cells-remember-allergies">Newfound immune cells are responsible for long-lasting allergies</a></h4>

              
                <p>Allergy sufferers may one day be able to erase the source of their congestion, itchy skin and swollen lips and throat thanks to two studies that have uncovered elusive immune cells that maintain allergies over the long haul, often for a lifetime.</p>



<p>A specialized type of immune cell called <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adi0673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type 2 memory B cells</a> or <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adi0944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MBC2s</a> hold the memory of proteins that cause allergies, two independent groups of researchers report February 7 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. Memory B cells are important for long-lasting protection against infectious diseases, but this subset is primed to make the type of antibodies that lead to allergies.</p>



<p>Unmasking the cells’ identity might lead to new ways to diagnose, treat or even cure allergies.</p>



<p>In the United States, about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm#:~:text=Nearly%201%20in%203%20U.S.,National%20Center%20for%20Health%20Statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third of adults and a quarter of children</a> have allergies, with symptoms ranging from seasonal sniffles to life-threatening reactions to food or insect stings. Allergies happen when the immune system unleashes a type of antibody called IgE on innocuous proteins. Usually, those antibodies are reserved for fighting parasitic worms, but in people with allergies, the antibodies target harmless things such as pollen, peanuts and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cat-allergies-asthma-therapy-allergy-shots">pet dander</a> (<em>SN: 11/4/22</em>).</p>



<p>While some allergies disappear over time or with therapy, others last a lifetime. For decades, scientists have been searching for the source of the long-lived allergies.</p>



<p>Recently, researchers found that cells that help the immune system remember vaccinations and natural infections may be involved. These memory B cells produce a different class of antibodies known as IgG, which ward off viral and bacterial infections and neutralize toxins. But no one had identified exactly which of those cells were recalling allergens or how they switched to making the IgE antibodies responsible for allergies.</p>



<p>To uncover the mysterious cells, two research teams took a deep dive into the immune cells of people with allergies and some without.</p>



<p>Immunologist Joshua Koenig and colleagues examined more than 90,000 memory B cells from six people with birch allergies, four people allergic to dust mites and five people with no allergies. Using a technique called RNA sequencing to find out what individual cells were making, the team identified specific memory B cells, that it dubbed MBC2s, that make antibodies and proteins associated with the immune response that fights parasitic worms and causes allergies.</p>



<p>In another experiment, Koenig and colleagues used a peanut protein to go fishing for memory B cells from people with peanut allergies. The team pulled out the same type of cells found in people with birch and dust mite allergies. In people with peanut allergies, those cells increased in number and produced IgE antibodies — the ones responsible for allergies — as the people started <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oral-drops-could-one-day-protect-people-peanut-allergies">therapy to desensitize them to peanut allergens</a> (<em>SN: 9/4/19</em>).</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s a smoking gun observation,” says Koenig, of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. “You find the cells present in the allergic people. It&#8217;s not present in the nonallergic people.… These cells are the ones that are making these antibodies, and that&#8217;s how this memory is being held.”</p>



<p>Another group led by Maria Curotto de Lafaille, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, also found that similar cells — which her group calls type 2 memory B cells — were more abundant in 58 children allergic to peanuts than in 13 kids without allergies.</p>



<p>It’s clear that both groups have found the same cells, says Cecilia Berin, an allergist and immunologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. There are “very consistent findings between the two groups,” she says.</p>



<p>Lafaille’s team found that the cells are poised to switch from making protective IgG antibodies to allergy-causing IgE antibodies. Even before the switch, the cells were making RNA for IgE but didn’t produce the protein. Making that RNA enables the cells to switch the type of antibodies they make when they encounter the allergen. “They are one step ahead of other cells to respond and to switch,” she says.</p>



<p>The signal to switch partially depends on a protein called JAK, her group discovered. Stopping JAK from sending the signal could help prevent the memory cells from switching to IgE production, Lafaille says. Other researchers at Mount Sinai are testing a JAK inhibitor drug called abrocitinib in people with food allergies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lafaille also predicts that allergists may be able examine aspects of these memory cells to forecast whether a patient’s allergy is likely to last or disappear with time or treatment.</p>



<p>Knowing which population of cells enshrines allergies in long-term memory may eventually help scientists identify other ways to starve or kill the allergy cells, Berin says. “You could potentially get rid of not only your peanut allergy but also all of your allergies.”</p>

Let your stressed-out partner know you’re for real by choosing a spot to
 eat. This is a love language that every single person desires, but 
almost no one can express. Looks like it’s frozen pizza again.</p><p><b>Talking About Your Commute</b><br />
There is an extremely high concentration of individuals with this love 
language in New York and LA. Going on and on about trains, or highways, 
or traffic, or “I think it took me 25 minutes last time, but this time 
it took 35 — weird” is the only way this group can show their sweetie 
they care.</p><p><b>Explaining How You Feel About Facebook</b><br />
Some people can only express their love by unpromptedly exclaiming that 
they’re going to delete their Facebook, and for real this time. Studies 
show this can be hard to discern as a love language because it is 
insufferable.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>...and my personal favorite:<br /></p><p><b></b></p><blockquote><b>Replying to But Not Liking Tweets</b><br />
This is a dark and horrific way to express affection, but we must begrudgingly acknowledge it.</blockquote><br /><p></p><p><b>Love Languages on a Likert Scale</b></p><p>As any decent social psychologist will tell you, The Love Language® Quiz has <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-030-39903-0_480" target="_blank">poor psychometric properties</a>, meaning that the validity and reliability of the measurement instrument is very low. A remarkable number of studies have investigated the concept of love languages, and there is no empirical support for the idea, as recently reviewed by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214231217663" target="_blank">Impett, Park, and Muise (2023)</a>. A major issue is the way that Chapman frames his questions (as forced choices between two options). Instead, rating each item on continuous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert-type scales</a> reveals no correlation between scores on the quiz and scores on the continuous measure.  <span style="font-size: 85%;"><span class="serif-fonts" style="font-family: 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', FreeSerif, 'DejaVu Math TeX', 'URW Bookman L', serif;">“</span></span>These findings discount the notion that each person has a primary love 
language and illustrate that people value all five love languages but 
perhaps in different contexts,<span style="font-size: 85%;"><span class="serif-fonts" style="font-family: 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', FreeSerif, 'DejaVu Math TeX', 'URW Bookman L', serif;">”</span></span>  said <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214231217663" target="_blank">Impett and colleagues</a>.<br /></p><p></p><br />So why <b><i>are</i></b> Love Languages <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24067506/5-love-languages-gary-chapman" target="_blank">so popular?</a><br /><blockquote>“If I had to pick one reason why I think many couples find Chapman’s book to be helpful,” says [<i>co-author Haeyoung Gideon</i>] Park, “it is not because they learned their own or their partner’s love language but because it gets people to identify any currently unmet needs in their relationship and opens up lines of communication to address those needs.”</blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br /></p><p><b>Footnotes</b></p><p><sup><b><span style="color: #800180;">1</span></b></sup> I'm not saying which one.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-american-patagonia-cave-paintings-surprisingly-old">These South American cave paintings reveal a surprisingly old tradition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Near the southernmost tip of South America, people may have started cave painting nearly 8,200 years ago, several millennia earlier than previously suggested by ancient rock art in that area.</p>



<p>Dating of comblike depictions in a cave in Argentina indicates that these designs belonged to <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rock art tradition that lasted more than 3,000 years, ending around 5,100 years ago</a>, researchers report February 14 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Ancient South Americans painted a variety of designs on the cave’s internal wall and part of its ceiling over roughly 130 generations, probably to preserve cultural knowledge shared by regional hunter-gatherer groups, archaeologist Guadalupe Romero Villanueva and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Prior studies suggested that extremely dry conditions kept South America sparsely populated during this period. &nbsp;Small, dispersed groups would have needed a central spot to preserve visually their ecological and ritual know-how, the investigators say.</p>



<p>Paint pigments used in the Argentinian cave designs provided the oldest direct dates for rock art in the Americas, Romero Villanueva says. For comparison, indirect measures of mineral growths that formed over and underneath an Indonesian cave depiction suggest it’s the oldest known rock art anywhere, dating to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-cave-painting-art-pig-found-indonesia">at least 45,500 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>The Argentinian cave, known as Cueva Huenul 1, lies about 1,000 meters above sea level in a desert region of northwestern Patagonia. Its internal wall and part of its ceiling display 895 painted designs, including geometric shapes, cross-shaped lines and figures of humans and llama relatives known as guanacos.</p>



<p>Romero Villanueva, of the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Buenos Aires, and colleagues radiocarbon-dated minuscule chips from four cave paintings of similar, comblike designs. Three paintings yielded reliable age estimates.</p>



<p>Dating of material excavated inside the cave, including guanaco bones bearing butchery marks, indicate that people first reached the site as early as around 11,700 years ago. The scientists say that no signs of hunting or other daily activities appear in the cave when rock art was produced there, underscoring the cave’s transition from a general-purpose site to a special place for keeping cultural knowledge alive via painted images.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/could-rice-meat-hybrid-be-dinner">Could a rice-meat hybrid be what’s for dinner?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Foodies of the future may be dining on beefed-up rice.</p>



<p>A new lab-grown meat product <a href="https://cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(24)00016-X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merges rice grains with cow cells</a>, scientists report February 14 in <em>Matter</em>. The rice acts as a scaffold that supports the growth of fat or muscle cells. Together, the ingredients form a rice-meat hybrid that steams up to a pinkish-brown mash.</p>



<p>It tasted delicious, “nutty and a little sweet,” says Sohyeon Park, a chemical engineer at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Lab-made beefy rice isn’t ready for the dinner table yet, she says, but it could one day offer a more sustainable way to eat meat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Current methods for producing meat include farming cattle, which requires vast expanses of pastureland and emits more than 100 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere each year. Finding ways to eschew the moo may be better for the environment, scientists suggest. Some potential alternatives include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-insect-cricket-farming-food-agriculture">cricket farming</a> and swapping meat for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meat-microbial-protein-climate-change-deforestation-fungi-algae">fermented fungal spores</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/19; SN: 5/5/22)</em>.</p>



<p>Lab-grown meat is another way to cut the cow (mostly) out of the equation. In the lab, Park and colleagues coated rice grains with fish gelatin and enzymes and then added cow cells to each grain. The fishy coating helped the cells stick to and grow inside the grains. And rice offers a 3-D structure for cells to cling to, like vines climbing a trellis. That structure gives the cultured cells a more meatlike heft, Park says. On their own, the cells grow in thin, flat layers.</p>



<p>Nutritionally, the hybrid rice is more sizzle than steak, with just 8 percent more protein than conventional rice. But Park hopes to boost that number by packing more cow cells into each grain. Rice wasn’t originally on her radar; but the grains worked surprisingly well, she says. What’s more, they’re inexpensive, nutritious and already popular — a grade-A ingredient.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/preparing-for-your-viva">Preparing for Your Viva</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Is your viva looming? Here, Emily Beswick, who completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh, shares her viva experience and offers you some valuable advice whilst preparing for yours! How can you attempt to predict discussion topics, how should you work back through your thesis, and do you know <em>why</em> you did what you did during your PhD?</strong></p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_afaa15ba17414183b6c55d6da0fddef6~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_899,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p><strong><em>  </em>   1.</strong><a href="http://1.Read" target="_blank" >,,<strong> Read</strong></a><strong>, read and read it again</strong></p>

<p>Take the time to read your thesis with ‘fresh’ eyes. For me, this meant printing a physical copy with text on one side so I could make notes on the opposite page, but this can look different for everyone. Opening the document in a new software, changing the font face, or printing it out enables you to really read what is on the page and distil the key points into your own notes. Everyone approaches this in different ways, many people choosing to read a new chapter each day, or in my friend’s case doing a ‘café crawl’ and reading a chapter in each new location. </p>

<p>   <strong>   2. Know your audience</strong></p>

<p>Find out as much as you can about your examiners. What are their research interests, and how do they align with your thesis? You cannot predict their questions, but you can predict the areas that they may be particularly interested in and might want to discuss in more detail. Reading about their current work, looking over past publications, talking to colleagues and considering their social media presence can go a long way to helping you understand the types of discussions that you might have. </p>

<p>     <strong>3. Prepare your elevator pitch</strong></p>

<p>Be prepared to summarise your entire thesis in a two-minute elevator-pitch style, ensuring it is engaging and accessible to another researcher (who may be in a slightly different field to you). Focus on what your work adds to scientific knowledge and why this gap is important to address. This is an opportunity to take a breath, break the ice and highlight what you think is key for the examiners to know; this will likely be one of the first parts of the viva discussion. </p>

<p>  <strong>   4. Redo literature reviews</strong></p>

<p>If you have any systematic reviews as a part of your thesis, or aspects of your introduction that particularly focus on cutting-edge aspects of your research area, re-run the literature searches. Check if there is any new published literature, or preprints, that might be relevant and could potentially come up in discussion. You can never read every paper that there ever was, or ever will be, but reading at least the abstract of the most recent contributions to the field can help you feel more prepared for a discussion. Focus on what you did differently to these researchers, and how this new knowledge links to your own work. </p>

<p>   <strong>  5. Background questions</strong></p>

<p>A large portion of the viva is discussing your thesis in context, considering what your findings add and why you did what you did. I found these questions from Twitter (or X!) to be helpful for considering what my thesis added. Preparing short responses beforehand to questions like these can make you think more deeply about the ‘why’. </p>

<p>Considering the impact of your science is important and be prepared to have a discussion about the context of the research; what came beforehand and why is the research question worth answering?</p>
<ul>
  <li>What motivated you to carry out this research?</li>
  <li>What issue in society does your research address?</li>
  <li>What are the three most important papers that relate to your thesis?</li>
  <li>What published work is closest to yours and why is yours different?</li>
  <li>What are the most recent developments in your area?</li>
  <li>Why did you use your research methodology?</li>
  <li>To what extent do your contributions generalise?</li>
  <li>How does your thesis contribute to knowledge?</li>
  <li>What are the strongest and weakest parts of your work?</li>
</ul>
<p>    <strong> 6. Acknowledge, but accept, your studies’ limitations</strong></p>

<p>A crucial part of the viva is thinking about the methods you used and considering why you used them. One way to do this is by focusing on the limitations sections that you have written for each chapter. It is important to consider what you would have done differently at the time, if you had the understanding you have now. With the beauty of hindsight, there might be decisions that you would change, or alternative methods that you would have used. However, instead of focusing entirely on what you would have done differently, consider why it was the right decision with the information you had at the time. Remember that these were written at the chronological end of each study. Be confident in your judgement and acknowledge that the decision was made at that time for a reason.</p>

<p>    <strong> 7. Revise the techniques that you used</strong></p>

<p>For lab-based PhDs, this will likely mean reviewing the methods that you used, ensuring that you are comfortable explaining them, particularly those which are more unusual and novel. If any techniques were performed by other people, or outsourced off-site, ensure that you are confident talking about the methods and how they contribute to the findings. These may be more likely to be discussed within the viva, to consider why they were used over more standard protocols, and how the findings can be interpreted. In other PhDs, this may be particularly focused around the statistical analysis techniques that you used to analyse your data. Focus on being able to summarise and justify these techniques succinctly, and in context with your work. For PhDs similar to mine that use standardised clinical rating scales, an understanding of the scales themselves can be helpful to revise and refresh. The number of items, concepts evaluated, and why this scale was chosen, over those with similar aims, are also important topics to keep in mind. </p><figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_dcb709e85e2146f7ac0b23379111349e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png"  ></figure><p>   <strong>  8. Enjoy yourself!</strong></p>

<p>But most crucially of all, enjoy it! Many people imparted this advice before my viva and I thought that they were completely missing the mark, but I really did end up enjoying it. You will have worked so hard to write the thesis, revise, and edit endless drafts, and it can be quite isolating at times to get through the final push. The viva is a unique chance to justify all of your hard work, and to demonstrate your passion, with people who genuinely share your enthusiasm about your niche topic.  </p>

<p>Trust me when I say - it will be a fulfilling finale to your years of hard work.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/overdose-prevention-opioid-safe-injection-harm-reduction">U.S. opioid deaths are out of control. Can safe injection sites help?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">It’s June 2023 and Victor has been spending most of his days at what he calls his “second home,” on East 126th Street, between Park and Lexington avenues, in East Harlem. A dozen or so men congregate outside, some sifting through belongings in a plastic bag or texting on their phone, others sitting on folding chairs or stools, playing cards, smoking, talking or just watching passersby. As an unhoused person in New York City, Victor says OnPoint NYC, a nonprofit organization that opened two overdose prevention centers in November&nbsp;2021, provides him a “sense of community” he can’t get elsewhere.</p>



<p>Inside, Victor, who provided only his first name when I talked to him last June, will go through reception and into a back room. He’ll fill out a form that provides the information OnPoint needs to make sure he doesn’t die. The form asks for his name and time of arrival, what drug he’ll be consuming and how he’ll consume it. From a list that includes meth, marijuana, cocaine, crack, benzos, fentanyl, speedball and many more, he checks heroin, which he’ll inject. At the bottom, the form asks: “If you weren’t using here now, where would you have gone to use?” Options include the street, sidewalk, between cars, under a bridge, a park, a public restroom, a subway station, your own place (Victor doesn’t have one), a friend’s place or “other.” And it asks if he’d be using alone.</p>



<p>“Yes” is a common answer to that last question. That’s why OnPoint NYC exists. Its two locations, the one in East Harlem and one in the Washington Heights neighborhood, are the only officially sanctioned overdose prevention centers, or OPCs, operating in the United States. People bring drugs they’ve obtained elsewhere and use them under the supervision of trained staff who can provide sterile supplies for drug use and can respond to overdoses.</p>

They are the only officially sanctioned OPCs in the United States.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135751">ONPOINT NYC</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The approach remains highly controversial in the United States, with critics pointing out that the sites are sanctioning, if not encouraging, illegal drug use. What’s more, critics are concerned that OPCs increase crime, local drug use and public nuisance in the area. This opposition is just one of the challenges alongside many legal, social, financial and logistical barriers for an OPC trying to open and remain open.</p>



<p>“I understand what it sounds like, right? You’re gonna allow people to use drugs on your site,” says Sam Rivera, executive director of OnPoint NYC. “When people question whether it’s good or it gets people well, showing them is what gives them the answer. The answer is yes, of course it does.”</p>



<p>The United States had more than <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#:~:text=Overall%2C%20drug%20overdose%20deaths%20rose,overdose%20deaths%20reported%20in%202021." target="_blank" rel="noopener">106,000 drug overdose deaths in 2021</a>, the most recent year for which complete data are available. That’s more per capita than other high-income countries with available data. The vast majority of those deaths involve opioids, including prescription opioid medications and heroin, but predominantly synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Annual deaths from opioid overdoses have more than doubled since 2015.</p>



<p>“We obviously need to figure out what alternative interventions we can provide to people to prevent them from dying,” says <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/directors-page/biography-dr-nora-volkow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nora Volkow</a>, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Md. “It’s crucial.”</p>

<p>After Congress directed that institute along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH-RTC-Overdose-Prevention-Centers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to conduct a report in 2021</a> on the potential public health impact of OPCs, the agencies’ findings noted “the consistent observation that initial objections to OPCs from local stakeholders tend to disappear following their implementation.”</p>



<p>OPCs have existed around the world for decades. Research has shown that they meet many of their primary goals: reducing overdose deaths, health care costs, the use of emergency services, emergency room visits, hospital stays, public drug use, infectious disease from nonsterile needles, and drug-related litter, such as used syringes. The sites also let people test their drugs to find out what they actually include. Many sites provide additional services aimed at improving overall health — infectious disease screening or testing, wound care, substance use treatment referrals and other programs that meet health care or social needs.</p>



<p>There’s been growing interest in the United States as well. A 2017 study estimated that <a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-017-0153-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an OPC in Baltimore</a> that would cost $1.8 million a year to run would save the city $7.8&nbsp;million a year in health care costs, but Maryland’s legislature has yet to authorize one. A center operated in San Francisco for nearly 11&nbsp;months in 2022 before shutting down due to political backlash. Last year, the state of Minnesota and the city council of Somerville, Mass., each set aside money for OPCs. Additional sites have been proposed or are under consideration in Seattle, Denver, Philadelphia and elsewhere.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="#addictionhelp">More information: Where to find help for drug addiction</a></h5>
</div>



<p>OnPoint has become a model for proposed sites across the United States. Researchers are analyzing its data, alongside data from other countries, to assess how OPCs might fare in a country without universal access to health care, with limited social safety nets, and with more drug use and overdose deaths.</p>



<p>In April 2023, the National Institutes of Health awarded the first portion of a grant, expected to total more than $5 million over four years, to researchers who will assess the effectiveness and costs of OPCs based on data from OnPoint and another site approved by the Rhode Island legislature and slated to open this year. That data could help shape how future centers operate and what services they offer, as well as how the nation approaches drug use more generally.</p>



<p>For Victor, the benefits of OnPoint go far beyond the immediate services provided. “It’s them treating you and looking at you as a person, because most people, most places you go, once you tell them you’re doing drugs, they have an idea of who you are already, a stigma,” he says.</p>



<p>Fostering community can be key to recovery, Volkow says: “That building of trust and a sense of acceptance and belonging is really the first step that can make a person want to go to treatment.”</p>



<p>For Rivera, the experience at the center is, “for lack of a better term, a lovefest.” Though he says his staff never initiates conversations about detox, treatment, rehab or recovery, they nevertheless have those conversations every day with people who come to the center.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is harm reduction?</h2>



<p>The first OPC opened in Bern, Switzerland, in 1986, and today <a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-017-0153-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are more than 140 legally-sanctioned OPCs</a> in more than a dozen countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico and across Europe. Since Canada opened North America’s first OPC, Insite, in Vancouver in 2003, it’s <a href="https://health.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/opioids/responding-canada-opioid-crisis/map.html#wb-auto-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added dozens more sites</a> around the country, plus more “pop-up” mobile spots run out of tents or campers. OPCs are also known by other names, such as supervised injection sites, drug consumption facilities and safe consumption sites. But regardless of what you call them, the philosophy is the same: harm reduction.</p>



<p>Harm reduction “focuses on improving the health and reducing the negative health outcomes for individuals,” says Elizabeth Samuels, an emergency&nbsp;and addiction medicine physician at UCLA. “At its most basic level, it’s treating people with respect, dignity and autonomy,” and giving them info and tools “to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.” Laws requiring seat belt use in cars are harm reduction tactics. So are adding filters on cigarettes and distributing condoms to prevent pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted infections.</p>



<p>Samuels says there’s plenty of evidence that harm reduction strategies work to reduce drug-related problems. Yet in the United States, such interventions — providing safe, sterile drug consumption equipment, for example — are often stigmatized or criminalized. The current approach of punishing people who use drugs is a carry-over from the failed “war on drugs,” she says, “but it remains pervasive in the American psyche and in some portions of the general population.” We know addiction is a disease, not a moral issue, she says. “Pushing people underground and making them feel shame,” she adds, increases risky drug-related behaviors, such as sharing needles, which can transmit bloodborne diseases like HIV and hepatitis C.</p>



<p>Barriers to OPCs in the United States are financial (for example, who is going to fund them?), logistical (where will they be located?) and social (will communities accept them?). But the biggest hurdle has been legal. In a <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title21-section856&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section often called the “crack house statute,”</a> the <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/149074NCJRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986</a> makes it a felony to “knowingly open, lease, rent, use or maintain any place, whether permanently or temporarily, for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance.” Crack, a form of cocaine that is nearly always smoked, has come with harsher penalties than other forms of the drug. Cocaine in crack form has historically been perceived as more prevalent in Black communities, which has contributed to racial injustices.</p>



<p>A nonprofit called Safehouse tested this law in 2019, attempting to open an OPC in Philadelphia. The effort kicked off a court battle, and in 2021, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the proposed OPC would violate the statute. Safehouse continues to explore its legal options.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, harm reduction advocates in New York were growing desperate as people died from overdoses — more than 2,000 in New&nbsp;York City during 2020 alone. New York Harm Reduction Educators in East Harlem and the Washington Heights Corner Project, both harm reduction social services organizations, had been running syringe exchange programs and offering related services in the city since the early 1990s. Representatives from these groups had done the logistical groundwork to open an OPC and had the support of city hall. A 2018 feasibility study conducted by the city’s health department and funded by the New York City Council suggested that opening four OPCs in New York City could prevent up to 130 deaths a year and save $7&nbsp;million annually in public health care costs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/021024_OPC_inline_6_680.jpg?resize=680%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="Drug consumption booth with a brown wall, chair and light." class="wp-image-3135758" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/021024_OPC_inline_6_680.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/021024_OPC_inline_6_680.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3135758">Overdose prevention centers have drug consumption booths where people can take drugs they bring with supervision from medical professionals.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135758">YUKI IWAMURA/AFP GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the early days of 2021, the New York groups had a choice to make. The Safehouse ruling, from a different federal appellate court than the one overseeing New York, showed the potential legal risks of opening an OPC. But after President Joe Biden took office and listed “enhancing evidence-based harm reduction efforts” as a drug policy priority, the groups decided to move forward, merged into OnPoint NYC and opened two new sites.</p>



<p>“Our people are dying, and we know we have the medicine, the apparatus, everything we need to keep people alive, and they don’t have to die,” says Rivera, who was named as <a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2023/6270018/sam-rivera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of <em>Time</em> magazine’s most influential people</a> of 2023.</p>



<p>While most of OnPoint’s extra services receive funding through city and federal grants, the overdose prevention and drug supplies services are funded through private dollars, a mixture of individuals, nonprofit organizations and foundations.</p>



<p>So far, OnPoint hasn’t been challenged in court, but the Anti-Drug Abuse Act statute remains a major deterrent to building more centers, Samuels says. Lack of public funding and community resistance are also barriers. The vast number of people dying has changed the climate somewhat, she says. More people are seeking all the “evidence-based tools in our toolbox to prevent any further loss of life.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does existing OPC research show?</h2>



<p>Along the top of the back wall in the safe consumption area at OnPoint in East Harlem, where Victor uses his heroin, blue painted letters announce: “THIS SITE SAVES LIVES.” And below it in Spanish, “ESTE SITIO SALVA VIDAS.” Below are two defibrillators, each with plushies on top, including a Pokémon Psyduck, a gray puppy and even one shaped like a grinning bottle of naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses. Two crash carts are ready to go if the staff notice someone slumped over, becoming discolored or otherwise showing potential signs of an overdose, which happens about three to five times a week, says Alsane Mezon, a harm reduction specialist at OnPoint.</p>



<p>Existing research on OPCs, which comes primarily from Insite in Vancouver and the Uniting Medically Supervised Injection Centre in Sydney, suggests the sites do save lives. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871614018754?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first major systematic review</a>, published in 2014 in <em>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</em>, included a study looking at overdose deaths in Vancouver before and after Insite opened in September 2003. Nearly 90&nbsp;overdose deaths occurred within 500&nbsp;meters of the site in the period from January&nbsp;1, 2001 to December&nbsp;31, 2005, with the fatal overdose rate declining by 35&nbsp;percent after the opening. That’s compared with a 9&nbsp;percent reduction over the same time period in the rest of Vancouver.</p>



<p>In a study of the area around the OPC in Sydney, the average monthly number of ambulance calls for opioid-related overdoses in the hours the center was open, which numbered in the hundreds, decreased by 80 percent after its opening. The decrease was more dramatic than what was seen in the rest of the state of New South Wales. None of the studies included in the 2014 review or <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(21)00275-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a more recent one from 2021</a> documented any death from overdose inside an OPC.</p>



<p>Despite concerns from critics, the reviews also found no increase in crime, drug trafficking or drug use–related public nuisance associated with the OPCs but did document reductions in syringe litter and public drug use. And when it comes to concerns about the sites encouraging drug use, one study from the Vancouver site showed no increase in relapse rates or the overall number of people in the area who used drugs, nor a drop in those starting methadone therapy.</p>



<p>Neither review linked OPCs to a decline in the number of people who injected drugs, but four studies of the Vancouver site and one of the Sydney site suggested an association between visiting OPCs and the likelihood of being referred to addiction treatment or entering a detox program. The 2021 review, published in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>, found frequent use of OPCs increased the rate of accessing treatment by 1.4 to 1.7 times compared with those who used drugs but visited OPCs less frequently or not at all.</p>



<p>A study of the Vancouver site calculated that, after accounting for the cost of running the site, it saved 14 million Canadian dollars in medical costs over a decade, including prevention of 1,191 new HIV and 54 new hepatitis C infections.</p>



<p>Early results from OnPoint appear consistent with previous findings. OnPoint staff and NYC health department employees reported in <em>JAMA Network Open</em> that during <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnPoint’s first two months of operation</a>, 613 people used services a total of nearly 6,000&nbsp;times across both sites, most often for injecting heroin or fentanyl. As seen in Vancouver and Sydney, most visitors were male, and just over a third were unhoused. Center staff responded 125&nbsp;times to an overdose or near-overdose, with EMS being called five times and three people transported to the emergency department. OnPoint has <a href="https://onpointnyc.org/onpoint-nyc-releases-its-2023-baseline-annual-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not recorded any overdose deaths</a> within its walls since it opened.</p>



<p>Three-quarters of people who went to OnPoint said they would have used drugs in a public place. About half of those who went accessed other services there: picking up naloxone to have on hand, going to counseling, receiving medical care or a holistic service such as acupuncture.</p>



<p>Until OnPoint opened, the only peer-reviewed research on OPCs in the United States came from an underground site that opened in 2014 in an unnamed location. In a research letter reported in 2020 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, Alex Kral, a behavioral health epidemiologist based in the San Francisco Bay Area with the nonprofit research institute RTI International, and colleagues evaluated <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2015435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the site’s first five years of operation</a>. Out of 10,514 drug injections, 33 opioid-related overdoses occurred on-site and all were reversed with naloxone, with no deaths or transfers to medical facilities.</p>



<p>A separate study by Kral and colleagues, reported in <em>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</em> in 2021, looked at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871621000168?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police reports of incidents</a> in the area around the underground site and at two comparison sites without OPCs for five years before and five years after the site’s opening. Drug incidents had been declining around the OPC before opening and continued to decline afterward, suggesting the site had no negative impact. The analysis also found a decrease, rather than an increase, in crime around the OPC site.</p>



<p>Kral, who is not aware of other underground sites in the United States, also studied the OPC that opened in San Francisco in January 2022 and remained open through December of that year. In addition to safe consumption booths, the site offered on-site buprenorphine treatment (to treat opioid use disorder), legal services and even recreational activities such as karaoke competitions. That site reversed 333 opioid overdoses, about one per day it was open. Kral’s team analyzed data on general nuisance and drug-related nuisance within a 500-meter radius around the OPC and around a similar comparison area elsewhere in San Francisco. The analysis suggested, contrary to claims often made by critics, a reduction in nuisance overall, and no increase in drug-related nuisance or homelessness.</p>



<p>Similarly, a separate group of researchers, unaffiliated with OnPoint NYC, recently reported data showing <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2811766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no significant change in violent or property crimes</a>, 911 calls for crime or medical incidents or 311 calls related to drug use in the immediate six-block areas around the OnPoint OPCs.</p>



<p>The small amount of U.S. research has already started to inform policy, Kral says, pointing to the Rhode Island and Minnesota legislatures’ decisions to authorize the opening of OPCs. “We are seeing politicians take what can be a political risk to do this, and I think our data is part of the reason for that,” he says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What will the new U.S. study test?</h2>



<p>Still, the existing research isn’t without limitations. All of the studies are observational, meaning they can show correlations but cannot attribute benefits directly to the OPCs. Many other factors might play a role in local crime rates, medical service utilization, homelessness, infectious disease spread and so on.</p>



<p>OPCs are also far from homogenous. Though the systematic reviews found that OPCs reduce overdose deaths locally and do not come with increases in local drug use or crime, the 2021 review noted that not much research exists in “resource-poor and politically diverse settings.” Drug use and structural factors, such as law enforcement practices and stigma around drug use, differ across different regions. Assessments of the value of the OPC-linked social services, which themselves vary widely, are also limited.</p>



<p>All this leaves a big question open: Can OPCs dramatically reduce harm in the United States, a country with a lot of drug use and among the highest overdose mortality rates in the world?</p>



<p>The new study funded by the National Institutes of Health through the National Institute on Drug Abuse could <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/GnKjAqspAUe5MJeTcJj7vg/project-details/10629749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help answer that question by studying two OPCs over five years</a>. Researchers from New York University will look at both OnPoint sites, and Brown University researchers will focus on the OPC that is set to open in Providence later this year.</p>



<p>That Providence site, in the process of hiring a medical director and finalizing the location, will be funded by $3.25 million allocated from lawsuit settlements between the state and opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies, as well as with money from private foundations and donors, says Annajane Yolken, director of strategy at Project Weber/RENEW, a nonprofit that is helping establish the site. None of the NIH research money will go toward the center’s operating expenses.</p>



<p>The study, part of the <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2022/12/nih-launches-harm-reduction-research-network-to-prevent-overdose-fatalities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIH harm reduction research network</a>, will look at four outcome types: the impact on people who use the facilities, based on surveys and health records; effects on neighborhoods, including crime, public attitudes and economics; qualitative findings from interviews with OPC staff and clients; and the costs, of running the site versus health care savings, for example.</p>



<p>“We are first and foremost scientists — we’re not advocates — so our task is to bring the highest level of scientific rigor to these questions, and we’re hoping that the science can inform policy,” says Magdalena Cerda, the NYU epidemiologist leading the OnPoint portion of the study.</p>



<p>“There are some unique aspects of the U.S. context that justify the need for this kind of study,” says Brandon Marshall, the Brown University epidemiologist leading the Providence portion. Most countries with OPCs have universal health care, and OPCs are funded through that system. The United States doesn’t have that structure, which often means Americans engage with health care differently than people in other countries. “Here, health care provided at an OPC might be the first time someone is experiencing compassionate, low-threshold and free health care,” Marshall says.</p>



<p>Barriers to health care, particularly for chronic pain or mental health conditions, are likely one reason drug use is worse in the United States than in other countries, Kral says. Volkow also points to the “tremendous social disparities” in the United States.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>“Health care provided at an OPC might be the first time someone is experiencing compassionate, low-threshold and free health care.&#8221;</p><cite>Brandon Marshall</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Social inequities and the lack of a social safety net in the United States may influence how big a difference OPCs can make in reducing overdose deaths, Samuels adds. There’s also the punitive treatment of drug use, including its criminalization, and an aversion to harm reduction strategies compared with other countries with OPCs, Marshall says. He adds that addressing these issues is additionally challenging because of the racist roots of many U.S. drug policies.</p>



<p>What works in Canada and Australia may turn out not to work in the United States, and success may vary across U.S. locations too. One key strength of the two-site study is how much New&nbsp;York City and Providence differ from each other.</p>



<p>“One of the real values of our study is the fact that it leverages two very different contexts, a very urban, dense context of New York City and then the less urban, more suburban Providence,” Cerda says. “Being able to compare those contexts will hopefully give us some more generalizable insights.”</p>



<p>Another big difference will be the services provided. “If you’re going to open an overdose prevention center, then you have to think about all of these wraparound services,” Rivera says. Once people are there, they can have a decent meal, take a nap, meet with a case manager and more.</p>



<p>Cerda refers to OnPoint as the “Cadillac” of OPCs, because it offers so many wraparound services. The plan for the Providence site does not include as many of those services, but the site will be located alongside a treatment program. That could be a benefit for access to treatment, or it might make people more uncomfortable going there.</p>



<p>“We know that the more people use an OPC, the more likely they are to enter into some kind of addiction treatment program broadly,” Marshall says, “but we don’t really know at a more granular level what that looks like.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A need to pair data with stories</h2>



<p>When I met Rivera at his office at OnPoint in June, he was wearing torn gray jeans and a plain gray T-shirt that said in bold white letters: “HEALTH JUSTICE FOR ALL.” He’s a physically large presence, and with his thick, tattooed arms and hands adorned with silver and turquoise jewelry, he might seem intimidating if not for his kind eyes and inviting demeanor.</p>

prevention centers. According to a recent report, in their first year of operation, the sites were used more than 48,000 times by more than 2,800 people, with OnPoint staff intervening 636 times to prevent overdoses from becoming fatal.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135759">T. HAELLE</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hanging on the wall behind the desk in his office, cluttered with knickknacks both practical and decorative, is a plastic plaque commemorating the documentary<a href="https://creativetime.org/projects/clean-needles-save-lives-drug-users-doing-it-for-ourselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <em>Clean Needles Save Lives</em></a>. The 1991 film tells the story of the illegal needle exchange program, run by the activist group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, that was established in response to the AIDS epidemic.</p>



<p>Rivera defines “health justice for all” as access to health care without barriers — “an opportunity for someone who’s actively using drugs to use safely and have supplies that are clean and healthy. That’s health care,” he says. “Quite frankly, many drug users don’t have access to health care in the way they need it and deserve it.”</p>



<p>No one expects OPCs to solve the entire drug problem in the United States. For example, sites typically do not allow pregnant individuals or those under 18 to use their services, and women may not feel as welcome at many sites given that the people using OPCs are predominantly male, many with a history of incarceration.</p>



<p>Even for those who do visit the sites, there are barriers. Some people have difficulty injecting themselves, but most sites do not allow someone to help another person inject. Another potential barrier is a lack of smoke rooms — OnPoint has these but many OPCs do not — which is an equity issue because it excludes people who use drugs in this way.</p>



<p>Despite the limitations, Samuels says, OPCs have shown they help people and they save lives. “That’s meaningful in itself,” she says, “and part of a comprehensive, multimodal strategy to address the overdose crisis.”</p>



<p>Jonathan Giftos, an addiction medicine physician and the former assistant commissioner of the NYC Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care and Treatment, similarly regards OPCs as one piece of a bigger picture. While the city does not provide funding for OnPoint’s OPC services, the bureau where Giftos worked serves as the city’s liaison with the center, which does receive city funds for some of its extra services.</p>



<p>“No one service solves all problems, and they don’t necessarily replace or supplant other important things, like prevention or treatment or recovery spaces,” says Giftos, now chief of ambulatory care at NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull. “As we evaluate their impact, it’s important that we interpret the results through that lens and not think that because they didn’t solve every single problem facing a community, that they’re not effective.”</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306714" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualitative research from the underground site</a>, Kral regularly heard that people using the site didn’t have friends and felt disconnected from the community. OPCs allow vulnerable people who have been stigmatized by society and burdened by shame to “actually be themselves for a moment” and to develop relationships that encourage them to make decisions “about the kinds of things they want to change in their life,” he says. These centers offer possibilities that can’t be measured in overdose or infectious disease rates.</p>

<p>“The way I have been able to really help people is with empathy, respect and love,” says Mezon, the OnPoint harm reduction specialist. She is a medical assistant, but she says her personal interactions with people at the center are just as important as her clinical tasks. “When I come in, I tell them, ‘First you’re human. We’re going to show you respect,’ and that really changes the narrative.” Mezon says people come to the OPC from as far away as Long Island, Rochester, N.Y., and New&nbsp;Jersey not only because they can get a shower and test their drugs for fentanyl and other substances, but also because they know they will be treated with compassion.</p>



<p>She speaks about her work as a calling. “I have to walk this dark forest every day to find these beautiful flowers that get lost,” she says. “I’m just really grateful to have all walks of life here. This situation does not discriminate, so I’m here to help…. All the things that they’re not getting out there, we’re trying to give them in here.”</p>



<p>Marshall says a lot of work needs to be done to destigmatize addiction and emphasize the humanity of people affected by the overdose crisis. He believes that data and scientific research need to be paired “with the human perspective.”</p>



<p>Edward Krumpotich agrees. A drug policy consultant based in Grand Rapids, Minn., Krumpotich spent a lifetime battling addiction himself and lost his brother to a heroin overdose. He has also helped write half a dozen harm reduction bills in three states, including one that legalized drug paraphernalia, and advocated in favor of Minnesota&#8217;s 2023 legislation to authorize funding for an OPC.</p>



<p>“Many times, we get stuck in certain statistics. That doesn’t tell the whole tale of how this crisis is happening,” he says. “I think what it’s going to take is when community members realize that their next-door neighbor or their family member is somebody who suffers with this disease. I think when people realize that people like myself, who have been to 30-plus treatments, now write nation-leading law, it can happen to anybody.”</p>



<p>Marshall says personal narratives can change people’s hearts and minds. “Some of the strongest voices are people with lived experience who can really humanize this issue and explain how the crisis has personally affected them,” he says, “and how things like harm reduction enabled them to live happy, healthy lives.”</p>

<p>Following a complaint from a reader, editors at the U.S.-based publisher Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) determined the researchers behind two decade-old papers had committed “self-plagiarism,” charges the authors deny, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>However, IEEE passed the buck on to Elsevier, which published one of the articles a month after IEEE had published the other. Elsevier, in turn, said it is wrapping up its investigation and will make the conclusions public “once final.” And one of the authors said a corrigendum is in the works.</p>



<p>The studies share three authors, including last author Li-Qun Zhang, a professor in the Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science at University of Maryland School of Medicine, and both focused on movement of the knee as it relates to people with osteoarthritis.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-128755"></span>



<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6665072">Real-Time Knee Adduction Moment Feedback Training Using an Elliptical Trainer</a> was published online November 14, 2013, in <em>IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering</em>, whereas <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165027013004184">Real-time tracking of knee adduction moment in patients with knee osteoarthritis</a> appeared online December 19 of that same year in Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Neuroscience Methods</em>. Only the latter title states when it first received the manuscript, which was on June 10, 2013.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2023, someone who identified himself to Retraction Watch as a friend of someone who has worked with Zhang in the past raised concerns about “self-plagiarism” to Daniel Ferris, the former editor-in-chief of<em> IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,</em> after noticing &#8220;substantial overlapped contents, contexts, and conclusions&#8221; between the two articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The friend told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The overlaps are significant, so I did not elaborate the details one by one. Before reporting, we posted those two papers on a public website (ResearchGate) to see how people thought about them. Most of them said like the authors merely changed the title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In December 2023, Ferris responded to the friend, stating that an independent committee of associate editors reviewed the complaint and the authors had been informed. After examining the evidence, &#8220;the committee came to the conclusion that self-plagiarism had been committed as some data had been re-used and there was considerable overlap in the papers,&#8221; Ferris told the friend.</p>



<p>Ferris also stated the journal would take an &#8220;appropriate action&#8221; as a result of the situation. But when Retraction Watch contacted Ferris about what this action might be, he told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The journal followed IEEE policy as outlined in the IEEE operations manual (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/section-822.html">https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/section-822.html</a>). After following procedures to get a response from the authors and forming a committee to review the allegations, a report was sent to the IEEE Publications office. They determined that because the IEEE TNSRE paper was first, there was no misconduct under the jurisdiction of IEEE.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Giuseppe Di Giovanni, editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Neuroscience Methods, </em>told Retraction Watch the &#8220;case is still in progress.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Megan Monachino, Senior Publisher of Life Sciences for Elsevier, added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are in the final stages of our investigation. At this stage, the details of the case are confidential; however, the conclusion will be made part of the publication record once final.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, Zhang denies the allegations, but said a corrigendum is in the works. He told Retraction Watch:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The first paper with IEEE (Kang et al.,2013) was on the methodology development of real-time knee moment determination with experimental corroborations on healthy subjects, while the second JNM paper was on subsequent clinical study of patients with knee osteoarthritis and biomechanical changes with knee OA. The differences can be seen in the Results figures of the two papers. The lists of authors for the two papers were also different. However, the Methods section of the second paper was similar to that of the first (Kang et al.,2013). Since the computations involved in the studies were complex, and to facilitate readers, the key method and procedure were described in a simplified manner in the second JNM paper. To avoid confusion, we did not change the frequently occurring terminologies and symbols in this paper, which also contributed to the overlap (overall 31% similarity between the two papers). Moreover, the first paper (Kang et al.,2013) paper was cited throughout the second paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first paper with IEEE was published electronically in 2013, before the second JNM paper published in 2014. So the self-plagiarism issue is with the second JNM paper. The JNM editor investigated the issue carefully and concluded that there is no case of duplicate publication. However, there is 31% similarity in the text. We have submitted a corrigendum accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Update, 2/15/24, 0300 UTC: </p>



<p>Update: On February 1, two weeks after we requested more details about Elsevier&#8217;s investigation, the publisher issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027024000062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy corrigendum to Zhang et al&#8217;s paper</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/is-this-a-newborn-white-shark">Does this drone image show a newborn white shark? Experts aren’t sure</a></h4>

              
                <p>In late January, the internet went all <em>“Baby shark, doo doo doo.”</em></p>



<p>Video of a purported newborn white shark, taken by a drone off the coast of California, went viral, garnering over a million views and a spate of somewhat breathless news coverage. The shark measured an estimated 1.5 meters long and appeared to be shedding a whitish film, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-024-01512-7" data-type="URL" data-id="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-024-01512-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly from recent birth</a>, Carlos Gauna and Phillip Sternes described January 29 in <em>Environmental Biology of Fishes.</em></p>



<p>If confirmed, it would be the first sighting of such a young white shark (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>) possibly just hours after birth. Plus, it could provide clues to where these enigmatic and endangered sharks’ breeding grounds are located.</p>



<p>Gauna, an independent wildlife videographer, spotted the unusual-looking young white shark in July along the coast near Santa Barbara with Sternes, a marine biologist at the University of California, Riverside. While adult white sharks have a grayish upper side and whitish underbelly, this shark appeared to be pure white. Besides its estimated size, other clues to its age became apparent upon reviewing the video, Gauna says: It appeared to be shedding some mucus layer and its fins appeared underdeveloped.</p>



<p>But while tantalizing, it’s too early to go goochie goo over the evidence, shark experts say. “It’s an interesting observation,” says Chris Lowe, an ichthyologist at California State University, Long Beach. But “I do think it&#8217;s a little overblown.” For starters, there’s only a drone shot as potential proof. Testable samples or other similar observations would be needed to confirm if the young shark was, in fact, a newborn.</p>



<p>The researchers themselves are careful to couch their finding with words like “possible” and to provide an alternative explanation for the milky film: It could be a skin condition. And they agree more sightings are needed.</p>



<p>Whether or not the images capture a newborn, the sighting has thrown a new spotlight on these <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/why-great-white-shark-sightings-are-good-news">cryptic creatures</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/14</em>). Here’s what we know about white sharks, and what this new evidence can — and can’t — tell us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where do young white sharks live?</h2>



<p>The aerial video was shot 400 meters off the coast of California. The spot is near one of four coastal sites along southern California where young white sharks are already known to congregate, thanks to fishing records, some going back decades, and increasingly more high-tech surveillance.</p>



<p>“Back in the day, I remember filling up helium balloons with cameras underneath to try to observe what was happening to these sharks,” says Michelle Jewell, a marine biologist at the Michigan State University Museum in East Lansing. Now drones, tagging and satellite tracking are often the tools of choice.</p>



<p>Lowe and his team use drones to spot white sharks. Then the team drives up alongside them in boats to attach tracking tags. Satellite data have shown that young and juvenile sharks frequently visit the four coastal sites, sometimes migrating between them, and stay there for days to months. Juveniles tagged by Lowe’s team have turned up at a fifth site in Baja, Mexico, the data show. “In a year, they have migrated down to Mexico, and back to California,” Lowe says.</p>



<p>Unlike many animals, mother great whites show no <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orca-mom-sons-favoritism-killer-whale">parental care</a> (<em>SN: 02/09/2023</em>). “They drop and run, and the [pups] are on their own,” Lowe says. These coastal sites are nurseries, experts say, a safe haven that provides the young sharks protection from larger predators and also easy access to food sources such as fishes and squids.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where are white sharks born?</h2>



<p>That’s still a mystery.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Personally, I don&#8217;t think that those young ones have to travel very far,” Gauna says. “They have to be born nearby to get to these nurseries.” Pups born farther offshore would have to make a perilous journey through deep, predator-infested water to reach the safer coastal waters, he and Sternes say.</p>



<p>Other experts disagree, saying all the evidence to date doesn’t hold for coastal births. If a female gave birth recently and nearby, some experts say it would be unusual to see just one pup. That’s because white sharks, which have two uteruses running the length of their body, give birth to 10 pups on average at a time, each about 1.5 meters long. That’s 15 meters of white shark pups tucked inside of gravid females.</p>



<p>“California is the most heavily flown-over coastline in the world,” Lowe says. “Between helicopters and fixed-wing planes, if 18-foot big females were coming in and dropping pups along our beaches, somebody would see it.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-make-mapping-hot-spots-ammonia-pollution-easier">Satellite tracking data</a> (<em>SN: 01/04/2019)</em> have also shown that “around every three years, large female white sharks go far from their regular home range, stay there for a while and leave,” Jewell says. That suggests that the reproductive cycle for female great white is three years. But the tracking data alone do not have enough information to say what white sharks do in these far-flung remote places.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Researchers filmed a young great white shark off the California coast near Santa Barbara, that appeared to be sloughing off its skin layer. The sighting might give clues to where white sharks are born.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does a newborn white shark look like?</h2>



<p>That’s a mystery too — because no one has witnessed a white shark giving birth.</p>



<p>But there is a way to visually estimate a young shark’s approximate age: Look at the color and texture of the yolk scar present between its pectoral fins. “It is like a belly button, where the baby shark used to have its yolk sac,” Lowe says. The yolk sac, which nourishes the embryo, gets used up inside the mother’s uterus, leaving a mark where it was once attached to the pup. The scar appears red and raw-looking in the smallest white sharks Lowe’s team has caught. As the white shark grows, the scar turns white and becomes raised, disappearing by about the time the shark is a year and a half old.</p>



<p>Gauna and Sternes couldn’t spot the underbelly yolk scar from a drone shot. But they say there is another visual clue to the shark’s age: Both the dorsal fin and pectoral fins of this shark seemed underdeveloped and rounded.</p>



<p>“Why would the fins be rounded?” Gauna asks. “Well, to exit the [womb of the] mother.” That rounded shape has been documented in embryonic sharks found inside pregnant females that have died. &nbsp;By the time the sharks are a year old, the fins take on a sharper, more defined shape, Sternes says.</p>



<p>But with a drone shot alone, it is hard to gauge the depth of the shark’s location, making it difficult to estimate its true shape and size because water can distort an image, Lowe says.</p>



<p>Another clue to the shark’s age is the white material that seemed to be sloughing off its body in the video, Gauna and Sternes say. It could be a film of substances from the womb that coated the pup during birth and still clung to it. An autopsy of a pregnant shark in 2016 revealed that her uteri contained a lot of “yellowish viscous uterine fluid.” While it’s unknown how long the sharks produce this “uterine milk,” that’s what could be covering the young shark, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>An unknown skin condition is another possible explanation, the team and other experts say. When sharks visit coastal sites, “they are in areas that have a lot of pollution and human runoff,” Jewell says, which could cause a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/epidemic-skin-lesions-reported-reef-fish">skin infection</a> (<em>SN: 08/01/2012)</em>.</p>



<p>While experts agree that the team have spotted something unusual, they say it is too early to jump to conclusions on whether it is a newborn.<br><br>“We need to add a layer of science and go and repeat and try [to] see the same thing over again and collect samples to whatever it is that&#8217;s coming off of that shark,” Jewell says. “What that something is, will then help us answer the rest of it.”</p>

<p><strong>Fossils show man walked 3 million years ago</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/fossils-show-man-walked-3-million-years-ago"><em>Science News</em></a>, February 16, 1974</p>



<p>Anthropologist D. Carl Johanson … has discovered a skull fragment, shin and thigh bones of a 3-million-year-old man in Ethiopia…. The bones belonged to an ape man (hominid) of the genus <em>Australopithecus</em>.… “We have absolute, concrete evidence that our ancestors walked on two legs over 3 million years ago,” the 30-year-old scientist told a news conference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update</h4>



<p>Exactly when upright walking emerged in the evolutionary history of humans remains hotly debated. Fossil analyses suggest that several hominid species ambled around on two legs about 5 million to 7 million years ago. An upper leg bone of the oldest known, 7-million-year-old <em>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em>, bears <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-hominid-limb-fossils-sahelanthropus-tchadensis">signs of upright walking including an inner projection near the hip joint</a>, scientists reported in 2022 (<em>SN: 9/24/22</em>). But not all paleoanthropologists are convinced those features prove a two-legged gait. And some scientists think the bone belonged to an ape that may have walked upright at times.</p>

<p>In what has become a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">familiar refrain</a>, more than 30 editors and advisors of an economics journal have resigned because they felt the publisher’s need for growth would increase the “risks of proliferation of poor-quality science.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4md5d3oth3ap3995op7z0/public-statement-resignations-from-the-editorial-board-of-the-journal-of-economic-surveys-final.pdf?rlkey=lk43pcmovjc6yg74gfo1zaex1&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0">letter</a> uploaded to Dropbox on February 7, the editors and advisors of the <em>Journal of Economic Surveys</em> said: “We no longer believed that the corporate policies and practices of the Journal’s publisher, Wiley, as we perceived them through several statements made by Wiley and the draft of a new editor agreement submitted to the attention of Editors-in-Chief and Managing Editors by Wiley, were coherent with ours.”</p>



<p>Despite involving a lawyer, the now-former editors said:</p>



<span id="more-128749"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The non-negotiable documentation submitted to our analysis appeared to emphasize quantity over quality of the papers submitted and strongly favoured cross pollination among the various Wiley publications also in relation to papers that we would have not considered favourably for the Journal of Economic Surveys increasing–in our perception–risks of proliferation of poor-quality science.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement through a spokesperson to Retraction Watch, Allyn Molina, Wiley’s vice president of publishing development. said the company was “grateful to the leadership and dedication of the former Editors who created a strong foundation.” The journal offers an open access option, for a fee of more than <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14676419/homepage/fundedaccess.html">$4,000 per article</a>. But Molina said “this journal does not have any open access publishing targets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She continued:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley proposed increasing publication output by 4% over the prior year as a goal rather than a requirement. In absolute terms, that’s an increase of 2 additional articles per year. This is supported by significant growth in submissions and a trend of emerging topics in the field.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://profiles.waikato.ac.nz/les.oxley">Les Oxley</a>, one of the two former managing editors in chief of the journal, said he and his colleagues had “have no comment to make” on Wiley’s statement.</p>



<p>The mass resignation joins a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">growing list</a> of more than two dozen such episodes, as academic researchers battle for-profit journal publishing companies. Quoting public statements by Wiley, the editors wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley’s performance metrics for journals are “growth in submissions” and “growth in published articles”; Wiley also appears ready to affirm that “it’s all driven by volume ultimately”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company, the editors wrote, again quoting public statements, “considers it ‘important to keep authors at the center of journal strategy’” and “has an ‘Open Access (‘pay to publish’)’ business model and a ‘Cascade strategy of finding initially rejected articles another more appropriate home within Wiley’s portfolio.’”</p>



<p>Wiley told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We regularly take steps to ensure our journals are best serving the needs of the academic community. Over time, this means updating our editorial and production processes to improve the author experience, ensuring our workflows meet the needs of authors, librarians and funders, and bolstering processes to safeguard research integrity. Editors are key to making these changes happen, and our goal is always to reach common ground on changes that support the long-term success of the journal. We recognize that not all Editors will embrace these changes, and where compromise cannot be reached, it is sometimes in our mutual interest to part ways.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher said it “will work with the succeeding editorial team to carry on that legacy.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are currently working with members of the board and wider community to recruit new leadership for the journal. This is a fully transparent process that includes advertising and recruiting within the wider field. In partnership with the new editorial team, we plan to introduce best practice editorial workflows and broaden the journal’s scope to reflect new and emerging fields.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-wall-eurasian-reindeer-hunting-submerged">This Stone Age wall may have led Eurasian reindeer to their doom</a></h4>

              
                <p>If this underwater wall could talk, it might reveal that it once helped Stone Age Europeans hunt reindeer.</p>



<p>Submerged about 20 meters below the surface of the Baltic Sea off the coast of Germany, the wall stretches for almost a kilometer and contains nearly 1,700 stones, making it <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312008121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the largest human-made megastructures in Northern Europe</a>, scientists report February 12 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</em>.</p>



<p>The team suspects it was used for hunting large prey, similar to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-scaled-drawing-desert-kite">ancient hunting traps in the Middle East</a> and North America (<em>SN: 5/17/23</em>). If so, it would be the first known trap of its kind in the southern Baltic region. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers discovered the structure, dubbed the Blinkerwall, while mapping seafloor depths with sonar in 2021. The data revealed odd protrusions down below, so the team returned with underwater cameras to get a better look.</p>



<p>“When we found the rocks, I realized it&#8217;s possibly not a natural process that put these rocks together,” says Jacob Geersen, a marine geologist at the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde in Rostock, Germany.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely that tsunamis, glaciers, ice floes or construction of nearby underwater infrastructure could have positioned the rocks into their flattened S-like shape, Geersen and colleagues say. The rocks seem to be intentionally placed, with the largest boulder (calculated to weigh over 11,000 kg, or the weight of seven mid-size cars) sitting in the middle. Most of the other rocks weigh less than 100 kg — light enough to have been moved by people to connect the larger rocks scattered along the wall’s length.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of sediment cores taken from near the Blinkerwall suggest that a lake bordered the structure around 10,000 years ago, before the Baltic Sea rose 8,500 years ago and submerged the area. The wall probably funneled Eurasian reindeer — which last occupied the area around the time the wall was built — towards the nearby lake, where the trapped prey could have been easily killed. At that time, the only people in the region who could have constructed such a large wall were nomadic hunter-gatherers, says study coauthor Marcel Bradtmöller, a Stone Age archaeologist at Rostock University.</p>



<p>The wall provides insights into how people at that time worked with the land and each other. It likely required a group of at least 10 people to use the structure to hunt, says Bradtmöller.</p>



<p>Humankind has a long history of enhancing natural topography to obtain resources, says archaeologist Geoff Bailey of University of York in England. The team’s interpretation of the findings “sounds, to me, to be very plausible,” he says.</p>



<p>Now there’s more work to do, Geersen says. He and colleagues plan to take more sediment samples from under the rocks and search for artifacts near the wall, which could reveal clues about the people who lived there.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/migratory-fish-decline-un-report">Migratory fish species are in drastic decline, a new UN report details</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migratory species don’t travel with a passport, but they cross borders all the time. This makes the animals’ conservation a uniquely challenging, international effort.</p>



<p>That effort needs a lot of work, researchers argue in the <a href="https://www.cms.int/en/publication/state-worlds-migratory-species" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-ever “State of the World’s Migratory Species<em>”</em> report</a> published February 12 by the United Nations Environment Programme.</p>



<p>The report is the most comprehensive tally of the over 1,000 species protected under an international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals<em>, </em>or CMS. Nearly half of CMS species are experiencing population declines. Of those, fishes are faring the worst: 97 percent, roughly 56 species, are facing extinction. That includes species such as devil rays (<em>Mobula mobular</em>) and scalloped hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s that real decline in fish species that … is keeping me up at night,” said Kelly Malsch of UNEP’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre at a February 8 news conference.</p>



<p>The goal of the report is to guide priorities for CMS COP14, a meeting of global conservation leaders starting February 12 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to create new strategies for the protection of migratory species. This includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects. These groups overall are faring better than fishes, but the report still shows that 1 in 5 of all the species covered by the treaty is at risk of extinction. While much of the data in the report is alarming, success stories like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humpback-whales-south-atlantic-have-recovered-near-extinction">recovery of humpback whales</a> may provide ideas for protection of other species, including fishes (<em>SN: 11/18/19</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Danger zone</h3>



<p>The first-ever global tally of how more than 1,000 migratory species are faring shows fishes are doing much worse than other groups such as land mammals or birds. There are a greater percentage of critically endangered (red) or endangered (orange) species of fish than of any other animal group covered by an international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animal. While insects appear to be faring well, the report covers just one species — monarch butterflies (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) — and notes that their story is not so simple: While the species overall is listed as least concern, the ones that migrate are considered endangered.</p>

<p>U.N. researchers reviewed data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and found a 90 percent average decrease in the abundance of CMS-listed fishes since 1970. No other group of animals experienced an average decrease, let alone one this significant. The main culprits include bycatch (the accidental catching of fish), overfishing and pollution, the report notes.</p>



<p>The report goes beyond the species of every group already under the treaty’s protection and identifies almost 400 other species as vulnerable, including more than 200 fish species that are not yet protected — most of which have decreasing populations, like the zebra shark (<em>Stegostoma tigrinum)</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In need of protection</h3>



<p>The international treaty called the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals covers just about a quarter of all migratory species. Of the remaining 3,339 species not covered by the treaty, 399 are considered either threatened or near threatened. Once again, fishes top that list.</p>

<p>“When you drill down into it, very few fish species are actually protected,” says Richard Caddell, an expert in marine and environmental law and policy at Cardiff University in Wales, who was not a part of this report. Only a few, like those heralded for caviar, are better protected than the rest, mainly for their commercial value. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Protecting migratory species on land across multiple countries is hard enough. But when it comes to animals in water, it’s a whole other beast. Most of the ocean is a mystery, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-data-unknown-oceans-sea-mountains">new environments are still being discovered</a>, making conservation efforts harder <em>(SN: 4/30/23)</em>.</p>



<p>And fish have another problem — they’re not sexy, Caddell says. Fish don’t draw conservation funding and international recognition the way gorillas and elephants and other charismatic megafauna do. “People think of a fish as being something that ends up on their plates,” he says.</p>



<p>This report might help to change that.</p>



<p>It recommends ways to protect migratory fish species from pollution and bycatch, like attaching LED lights to nets to deter certain fish. But it also keeps fishes in the spotlight, weaving the discussion of them throughout the report. By making their decline central to this report, delegates at CMS COP14 may take more notice, Caddell says.</p>



<p>“States not acting might not be [failing to protect fish species] out of malice or negligence, but out of sheer ignorance as to the true conservation status of a number of these animals, which is why a report like this is brilliant,” Caddell says.</p>



<p>More than 100 parties have signed and ratified the CMS since 1979. The United States is not one of those countries, but it has agreed to elements of the treaty focusing on marine mammals and sharks. But even for nations that have ratified the CMS, there’s no real legal penalties if they don’t follow the treaty. Instead, Caddell says reports like this new one remind those involved to do better. </p>



<p>“I think this report is a very, very welcome development,” Caddell says. “There’s an opportunity here to build a little bit of political momentum to try to think about fish in a different way. And to move away from that we&#8217;re just there to eat them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/babies-ai-learn-words-model">How do babies learn words? An AI experiment may hold clues</a></h4>

              
                <p>The AI program was way less cute than a real baby. But like a baby, it learned its first words by seeing objects and hearing words.</p>



<p>After being fed dozens of hours of video of a growing tot exploring his world, an artificial intelligence model could more often than not <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi1374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associate words — <em>ball</em>, <em>cat</em> and <em>car</em>, among others — with their images</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 2 <em>Science</em>. This AI feat, the team says, offers a new window into the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/language-heard-never-spoken-young-babies-bestows-hidden-benefit">mysterious ways that humans learn words</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/17</em>).</p>



<p>Some ideas of language learning hold that humans are born with specialized knowledge that allows us to soak up words, says Evan Kidd, a psycholinguist at the Australian National University in Canberra who was not involved in the study. The new work, he says, is “an elegant demonstration of how infants may not necessarily need a lot of in-built specialized cognitive mechanisms to begin the process of word learning.”</p>



<p>The new model keeps things simple, and small — a departure from many of the large language models, or LLMs, that underlie today’s chatbots. Those models learned to talk from enormous pools of data. “These AI systems we have now work remarkably well, but require astronomical amounts of data, sometimes trillions of words to train on,” says computational cognitive scientist Wai Keen Vong, of New York University.</p>



<p>But that’s not how humans learn words. “The input to a child isn’t the entire internet like some of these LLMs. It’s their parents and what’s being provided to them,” Vong says. Vong and his colleagues intentionally built a more realistic model of language learning, one that relies on just a sliver of data. The question is, “Can [the model] learn language from that kind of input?”</p>



<p>To narrow the inputs down from the entirety of the internet, Vong and his colleagues trained an AI program with the actual experiences of a real child, an Australian baby named Sam. A head-mounted video camera recorded what Sam saw, along with the words he heard, as he grew and learned English from 6 months of age to just over 2 years.</p>

Today, Sam is a happy tween.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3135773">Courtesy of Sam’s dad</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The researchers’ AI program — a type called a neural network — used about 60 hours of Sam’s recorded experiences, connecting objects in Sam’s videos to the words he heard caregivers speak as he saw them. From this data, which represented only about 1 percent of Sam’s waking hours, the model would then “learn” how closely aligned the images and spoken words were.</p>



<p>As this process happened iteratively, the model was able to pick up some key words. Vong and his team tested their model similar to a lab test used to find out which words babies know. The researchers gave the model a word— <em>crib</em>, for instance. Then the model was asked to find the picture that contained a crib from a group of four pictures. The model landed on the right answer about 62 percent of the time. Random guessing would have yielded correct answers 25 percent of the time.</p>

<p>“What they’ve shown is, if you can make these associations between the language you hear and the context, then you can get off the ground when it comes to word learning,” Kidd says. Of course, the results can’t say whether children learn words in a similar way, he says. “You have to think of [the results] as existence proofs, that this is a possibility of how children might learn language.”</p>



<p>The model made some mistakes. The word <em>hand</em> proved to be tricky. Most of the training images that involved <em>hand</em> happened at the beach, leaving the model confused over <em>hand</em> and <em>sand</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Kids <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/babies-recognize-common-words-6-months">get tangled up with new words</a>, too (<em>SN: 11/20/17</em>). A common mistake is overgeneralizing, Kidd says, calling all adult men “Daddy,” for instance. “It would be interesting to know if [the model] made the kinds of errors that children make, because then you know it’s on the right track,” he says.</p>



<p>Verbs might also pose problems, particularly for an AI system that doesn’t have a body. The dataset’s visuals for running, for instance, come from Sam running, Vong says. “From the camera’s perspective, it’s just shaking up and down a lot.”</p>



<p>The researchers are now feeding even more audio and video data to their model.&nbsp; “There should be more efforts to understand what makes humans so efficient when it comes to learning language,” Vong says.</p>

<p>Erick Jones, the dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Nevada in Reno, is under fire for publishing a journal filled with what one academic called “<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/">bizarre” and “incoherent” articles</a>.</p>



<p>Jones founded the<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/home"> </a><a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/home"><em>International Supply Chain Technology Journal</em></a> in 2015 and served as the publication’s editor-in-chief until September 2022, when he <a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/prof-md-mamun-habib-phd-has-been-selected-as-the-next-editor-in-chief-of-the-isct-journal">handed off the reins</a> to a former member of his lab. The journal notes that it requires authors to pay an “honorary” charge of $199 to publish their manuscripts.</p>



<p>Jones’s <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0931-1935">ORCID profile</a> lists 71 articles published in the journal, although an accurate count is difficult because of discrepancies in the journal’s database and the title’s PDF files. The pages of the journal were also filled with articles from his wife, his son, his students and the current editor-in-chief, along with the occasional outside submission.</p>



<p>One of Jones’s papers, published in 2022, is titled “Using Science to Minimize Sleep Deprivation that May Reduce Train Accidents.” In the two-paragraph article, Jones and his coauthors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/UsingSciencetoreducesleepdeprivationintrainworkersIONJones.pdf">note</a> that “both humans and flies sleep during the night and are awake during the day, and both species require a significant amount of sleep.” After a description of an unrelated study on fly lifespans, they conclude:</p>



<span id="more-128736"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It is probable that the incorporation the findings of age-related health factors and increased sleep may lead to less train accidents. of these age factors when considering these options supply chain procedure for maintaining will be beneficial.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Jones’s other papers in the journal are also difficult to interpret. One is<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/259/257"> a statistical analysis</a> of the arrival times of planes to Dallas Fort Worth Airport on a single day, September 12, 2022, which finds that planes arrive quickly in the morning and more slowly later in the day. Another tries to link Jones’s expertise in supply chain management and radio frequency identification tags (RFID) to “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/192/190">Beauty Sleep</a>.”</p>



<p>The journal is not indexed by SCOPUS or Web of Science, though the articles do appear on Google Scholar. They are also tallied on Jones’s<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickcjones/"> LinkedIn profile</a> and in <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686749">press releases</a> about his record. Several of them have been cited in final reports submitted to the National Science Foundation and other agencies that have funded his research. Jones, a former NSF program director, currently serves on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/edu/advisory_members.jsp">the advisory committee</a> for NSF’s Directorate for STEM Education, and has received more than $700,000 in grant funding from the agency. Jones’s professional bio notes that he has “<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686749">garnered more than $9 million in grants and contracts</a>.”</p>



<p>Questions about the journal were first raised this week on the blog of statistician<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/"> Andrew Gelman</a>, and the controversy was covered by the student paper, <a href="https://nevadasagebrush.com/2024/02/07/unr-dean-of-engineerings-questionable-research-papers-arise/">The Nevada Sagebrush</a>, and a local news site, <a href="https://thisisreno.com/2024/02/unr-dean-faculty-member-accused-of-research-misconduct-over-self-published-research-articles/">This is Reno</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not a good look for the university,” says <a href="https://www.unr.edu/business/faculty-and-staff/lembke-ron">Ron Lembk</a>e, a supply chain expert at UNR’s College of Business, who was unaware of the journal’s existence until last week.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Jones did not respond to a request for an interview from <em>Retraction Watch</em>, but he defended the journal in<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/#comment-2315851"> an online comment</a>, by stating that he does not list those publications on his resume and that he started the journal only after receiving tenure.</p>



<p>“When I started I did not expect to be an administrator just a faculty member who tried to make a difference and provide access to more applied supply chain engineering technology ideas, projects and research,” he wrote. “I standby [sic] having public access to new thought.”</p>



<p>The current editor-in-chief, Md. Mamun Habib, also failed to respond to a request for an interview but has recently taken down the train accident article and published  <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/critic">a statement</a> about the criticism on the journal’s website, where he took full responsibility for the journal’s shortcomings.</p>



<p>“While you can argue on the merits, quality, or impact of the work it is all original and we vehemently disagree with anyone who says otherwise,” he wrote. Habib also noted that many authors have only paid just $9.99 or nothing to publish their articles and that authors are required to disclose whether they used Chat-GPT or other artificial intelligence software to help them craft their manuscripts.</p>



<p>The journal is just one piece of Jones’s educational mini empire, which includes&nbsp; a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TRACKED-invisible-inventory-monitoring-security/dp/0977708195">self-published book</a> and <a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/dejpib">a supply chain certification program</a>.</p>



<p>The university says it is investigating the journal. “We are taking the claim seriously,” says Jessica Lozada, a spokesperson for UNR. “It is standard practice for the university to review and investigate, which we are currently in the process of doing.”</p>



<p>Jones’s son, Erick Jones Jr., who is also a prolific author in the journal and a member of the editorial board, calls the controversy “growing pains.”</p>



<p>“You can criticize the science, you can say this paper is shit, but, you know, a year from now, the papers are going to get better, and, hopefully, we can actually be a legitimate journal,” he told Retraction Watch.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The elder Jones always had one foot in academics and one foot in business. “He takes risks, and that seems to have worked out well in his life,” says his son.</p>



<p>While working towards his PhD in industrial engineering at the University of Houston in the early 2000s, he supported himself with a job at Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm best known for its role in the Enron scandal.</p>



<p>After the firm’s collapse in 2002, Jones entered the real estate business, obtaining a realtor’s license and a mortgage broker’s license, and founding his first company, PWD Groups Inc., which would morph into the publisher of his future journal.</p>



<p>At the same time, he was moving up the ranks in academia.</p>



<p>He obtained his PhD in 2003 and spent eight years as a faculty member at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he worked with NASA to<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20080047724"> evaluate the feasibility of using radio frequency identification tags</a> (RFID) to keep track of supplies on the international space station.</p>



<p>In 2011, he joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Arlington, where he founded the<a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/research/centers-and-labs/raid"> RFID, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science (RAID) Laboratories</a>, attracting significant funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Transportation over the next decade.</p>



<p>Five years later, he was named Associate Dean of Graduate Affairs for the College of Engineering.</p>



<p>Then, in July 2022, he<a href="https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2022/engineering-dean"> accepted the dean’s job</a> at UNR, which came with a <a href="https://www.nevadafacultyalliance.org/resources/Documents/PUBLIC_DOCS/2023_UNR_Budget/UNR%202023%20vs%202022%20salaries%20top%2050%20f.pdf">$330,000</a> salary.</p>



<p>“What is exciting about having Jones as our new dean for the College of Engineering is how he clearly understands the current landscape for what it means to be a Carnegie R1 ‘Very High Research’ institution,” the provost said at the time. “He very clearly understands how we can amplify every aspect of our College of Engineering, so that we can continue to build transcendent programs for engineering education and research.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">By then, Jones had been running the <em>International Supply Chain Technology Journal</em> for nearly seven years.</p>



<p>Jones <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/02/06/its-bezzle-time-the-dean-of-engineering-at-the-university-of-nevada-gets-paid-372127-a-year-and-wrote-a-paper-thats-so-bad-you-cant-believe-it-i-mean-really-you-have-to-take-a-look-at-t/#comment-2315851">has stated</a> that his reason for starting his own journal was that publishing in top journals took too long and that “many in the field were not able to publish applied papers in this field in a timely fashion.”</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/issue/view/2">first issue</a>, he was a coauthor on two out of the four articles the journal published. In the <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/issue/view/3">second issue</a>, he was the primary author of all three articles.</p>



<p>One of his later articles, which is listed as one of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2028612&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">“main products”</a> of a $199,993 NSF grant, purports to use artificial intelligence to optimize the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines to vulnerable communities.</p>



<p>That <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10215577">paper</a> was edited and peer reviewed by three former members of Jones’s laboratory at UTA, and it was accepted two days after submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His work on the pandemic supply chain led the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Jones <a href="https://www.uta.edu/news/news-releases/2021/08/20/erick-jones-fellowship">to select</a> Jones to serve as a Jefferson Science Fellow, advising the chief economist of the U.S. State Department in 2021 and 2022.</p>



<p>After moving to UNR, Jones led a “<a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/prof-md-mamun-habib-phd-has-been-selected-as-the-next-editor-in-chief-of-the-isct-journal">competitive search</a>” to find a new editor-in-chief for the journal, considering candidates across industry and academics before settling on Mamum Habib, a former visiting scientist in his own lab, according to a press release from the journal. (Jones and Habib also worked together on the <a href="https://ojs.excelingtech.co.uk/index.php/IJSCM/index"><em>International Journal of Supply Chain Management</em></a>,<a href="https://clinicallibrarian.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers/"> </a>which is published by a company that was listed on <a href="https://clinicallibrarian.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers/">Beall’s list of potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers.</a>)</p>



<p>Jones’s wife, Felicia Jefferson, who recently joined UNR’s Department of Biochemistry and Biology, has also published articles connecting supply chain management to “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/256">Deer Season</a>,” “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/30/28">Healthy Hair</a>,” and “<a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/257">Dragon Fly Research</a>,” which consists of seven sentences about fruit fly sleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She has recently been awarded <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2341551&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">$299,323</a> from NSF to use artificial intelligence to conduct research on sleep in rural communities, following a theme she has developed&nbsp; in various papers she coauthored with Jones, including those about beauty sleep and train accidents.</p>



<p>“The lab, PI, Dr. Jefferson sees her lab as a smaller more focused version of a NSF scaled ERC center, which focuses on heart disease research through tissue regeneration,” she and Jones write in <a href="https://isctj.com/index.php/isctj/article/view/283/278">another recent article</a>. “Jefferson lab is more focused on AI models in biology that simulate sensor stimulation of brain cells.”</p>



<p>Jefferson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Erick Jones Jr., who was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Arlington just as his father was departing, argues that the journal is a valid avenue to get new ideas out and to help students publish.</p>



<p>“It’s helped me in my career, not for building up my publication record, but just starting conversations,” he says.</p>



<p>It’s undoubtedly a valued part of his father’s business portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal<a href="https://www.iscea.org/journals"> is one of two affiliated with</a> the International Supply Chain Education Alliance, an Ohio corporation which was founded in 2003 and bills itself as “the first organization certifying supply chain professionals around the globe” with thousands of members.</p>



<p>Jones has been involved with the organization for many years and was<a href="https://www.iscea.org/post/dejpib"> elected</a> president of the company’s standards board in 2020, when the journal first appeared on the company’s website.</p>



<p>Students who<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rfidscp-rfidscm-tickets-139093673923"> spend $1,499</a> for Jones’s three-hour RFID certification course receive a free copy of<a href="https://www.amazon.com/TRACKED-invisible-inventory-monitoring-security/dp/0977708195"> his book</a>, which is published by the PWD Group.</p>



<p>While working at the University of Texas at Arlington, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lml_4AQ7AFY">he even touted</a> ISCEA certifications to his students.</p>



<p><a href="https://southeast.iu.edu/biographies/index.php?bioID=94">Paul Pittman</a>, a supply chain management expert at Indiana University Southeast in New Albany, says that he has never heard of the ISCEA or the journal. He is the chair-elect of the<a href="https://www.ascm.org/"> Association for Supply Chain Management</a>, which also offers certifications and publishes two journals.</p>



<p>“You can claim anything you want, but the ASCM was established in 1957,” he says.</p>
