<p>Numbers are everywhere in retraction land lately: A record <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8">10,000-plus retractions in 2023</a>. 19 journals <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/academic-studies-research-paper-mills-journals-publishing-f5a3d4bc">shut down at Wiley</a>. Now here’s another.</p>



<p>Readers who have checked the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">Retraction Watch leaderboard</a> lately may have picked up on something notable: One researcher, Joachim Boldt, has now been credited with 210 retractions – making him the first author (to our knowledge) with more than 200 retractions to his name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boldt’s new tally – representing about half of his roughly <a href="https://typeset.io/authors/joachim-boldt-4jt8xm9emj">400 publications</a> – admittedly is an accounting change rather than new problems being identified. Some journals have only now come around to acting on the corrupt articles. In that sense, it reflects both progress and a frustrating lack of concern-slash-urgency on the part of the journals that have taken more than a decade to resolve the case.</p>



<span id="more-129263"></span>



<p>As we and others <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/10/28/top-german-anesthesiologists-cardiac-surgery-paper-retracted-over-very-serious-misrepresentations/">have reported</a>, the Boldt saga began about 14 years ago with emails to Steve Shafer, then the editor-in-chief of <em>Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia</em>, pointing out suspicious data in a study the German anesthesiologist had published in the journal in late 2009. (<em>The BMJ</em> has a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/187846?path=/bmj/346/7900/Feature.full.pdf">helpful timeline</a> about the case, including a bright line linking Boldt’s fraudulent research to potential harm to patients.)</p>



<p>Shafer, who is now a member of our advisory board, eventually became dissatisfied with Boldt’s responses, and then lack of responses, to his questions about the data, and helped trigger an initial institutional investigation into the researcher’s work. Anesthesiology’s recognition that there were problems in the literature – which came earlier for the field than for the vast majority of others – is likely responsible for the fact that so many anesthesiology researchers are among the authors with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">the most retractions in the world</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/05/driving-open-science-adoption-with-a-global-framewo/">Driving Open Science adoption with a global framework: the Open Science Monitoring Initiative</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by Veronique Kiermer and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz </em><br><br>Earlier this month the Open Science Monitoring Initiative <a href="https://open-science-monitoring.org/official-release-of-the-open-science-monitoring-initiative-website-and-starting-point-of-a-worldwide-consultation/">shared a draft of Open Science monitoring principles</a>, launching a worldwide consultation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re proud to have collaborated on the draft, drawing from our experience developing Open Science Indicators and building upon our participation alongside other nonprofit Open Science advocates, research organizations and policy-makers in a workshop hosted by UNESCO <a href="https://open-science-monitoring.org/news-n1/">last December</a> that initiated this effort. We are excited to see this important effort move forward in a forum that invites the participation of the broadest range of stakeholders from the scholarly community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any organization that promotes Open Science, like PLOS, needs to be able to monitor the adoption of Open Science practices. Context is important. Research is a global enterprise supported by a vast network of academic institutions, service and infrastructure providers, funders, and policy-making groups. The solutions we build have to be able to address the priorities and answer the questions each of those groups are asking. So far, this has led to the emergence of a variety of monitoring solutions that are not comparable. This limits the utility of data collected in different contexts and importantly it risks creating misalignments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our efforts to drive Open Science forward, we have <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">first-hand experience</a> of the barriers researchers face when the bodies that govern research culture and practice lack alignment. This is why the work of this group is so important: it will take a multi-stakeholder collaboration to drive context-specific but comparable monitoring solutions to support pathways to Open Science adoption for diverse communities.</p>



<p><strong><br></strong><strong>A shared foundation accelerates progress for all</strong></p>



<p>UNESCO&rsquo;s comprehensive <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about">recommendation on Open Science</a> is an important milestone towards a shared understanding and vision for Open Science that enables each of us to work in our own ways towards the same goal. How we implement this recommendation will also require the ability to monitor its adoption in ways that honor its principles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the Open Science monitoring initiative is focusing on collaboration and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. Despite the disparate needs or motivations an institution in Kenya, a funder in the UK, and a policy-making body in France may have for monitoring Open Science, adopting common principles will help provide a global understanding of progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more that we are able to share and learn from each other and study new aspects of the prevalence and effects of Open Science, the better-equipped we will be to see patterns which point to significant barriers for researchers, systemic challenges, structural inequities and potential biases. With a common set of principles for monitoring, we are one step closer to establishing equitable paths to Open Science.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Open Science monitoring for better Open Science practice</strong></p>



<p>When we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-partners-with-dataseer-to-develop-open-science-indicators/">envisioned Open Science Indicators</a> in 2022, it was with the recognition that we could not achieve our goal of advancing Open Science adoption without knowing where we were starting from, and how effectively our experimental solutions were driving us forward.</p>



<p>It felt important at the time to establish our own <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21640889.v1">underlying principles</a> to guide our future development, communicate what we were trying to do as transparently as possible and to help others understand and use our tools and data responsibly. The same reasoning that animated us then informed our input into the Open Science Monitoring initiative.<br></p>



<p>The data we are gathering through OSIs gives us a better understanding of the landscape of Open Science practices today, and that helps us see where interventions and solutions could be effective&ndash;or not so effective. Since implementing OSIs, we&rsquo;ve been able to look more closely at the regional differences in Open Science behaviors, as well as differences by discipline, and we&rsquo;re developing a better understanding of the effect of policies and solutions on influencing these behaviors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example we were able to see code-sharing rates at <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/09/code-policy-interview/">rose from 53% to 87%</a> in the first year after implementing our mandatory code-sharing policy, signaling that authors in this community were willing to make a bolder move towards this Open Science practice. We are also tracking the impact of making it easier for authors to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/open-science-by-discipline/">share preprints</a>, and incentives that could promote better <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/accessible-data/">data-sharing practice and usage</a>.</p>



<p>But journal policy is far from the only mechanism to change research-sharing norms. By the time a researcher is ready to share their work, many of their choices have already been made. They are influenced by their own context and circumstances: Does their national research body support sharing more components of the research? Will their institution recognize efforts to be more transparent? Is there funding and infrastructure to make it easy for them to do so? Do the solutions available fit the aims of the research itself?</p>



<p>We share our dataset and our findings publicly, hoping they may be helpful to others, and are always open to <a href="mailto:community@plos.org">feedback </a>and additional context-specific interpretations.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Working together to build a path forward</strong></p>



<p>There are numerous routes researchers can take to make their work more open. Part of what we want to achieve at PLOS is to support multiple pathways to Open Science by understanding what the academic landscape looks like and the motivations for researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know from our <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/z4py9">own research</a> that Open Science monitoring is a need we share with many organizations, and we have <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2024/03/collaboratively-seeking-better-solutions-for-monitoring-open-science/">been collaborating</a> to understand how monitoring needs align and differ between funders, institutions, and publishers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This collaborative work with funders and institutions, and in particular <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/2023/12/15/reflections-on-ukrn-open-research-indicators-work-so-far/">our work with the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) </a>to develop open research indicator pilots for institutions, illustrates that measuring the <em>prevalence </em>of Open Science practices is not enough. We also need to be measuring the <em>effects or qualities </em>of those practices to achieve the aims of greater transparency, integrity, and inclusion which are at the core of Open Science. We believe that Open Science is better science, and effective monitoring &ndash; and rigorous meta-research &ndash; can provide more evidence for this.</p>



<p>A systemic challenge requires a systemic solution. Figuring out how we do that must be a multistakeholder endeavor. It has to create a feedback loop between funders, policy-makers, institutions, infrastructure providers, researchers and publishers. Importantly, the diversity of perspectives is critical not only across sectors but also across disciplines, regional and economic contexts.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>The Open Science monitoring principles are for everyone, and we need your perspective</strong></p>



<p>We encourage all organizations that support Open Science, everywhere, to engage with the Open Science Monitoring Initiative&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eepqGt62NTdgy22jGp-nEsVC8zIvFZvexyIAVj3RdNA/edit#heading=h.yzcbfhb49wsk">draft principles</a>. A robust set of principles, informed by the broadest possible range of stakeholders, will be an essential asset for responsibly measuring the successes (and, where necessary, failures and unintended consequences) of all of our efforts.</p>

<p>An interdisciplinary journal says it will take “corrective actions” on a paper following a thorough investigation on a paper for which one author used ChatGPT to update the references.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Krithika Srinivasan, an editor of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/ENE"><em>Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space</em></a> and a geographer at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland, confirmed to <em>Retraction Watch</em> her journal is finalizing what actions need to be taken. After the probe concluded, Srinivasan says she submitted her recommendations to Sage, the journal’s publisher, who will take actions in line with their policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s clear from the probe, she says, is that “none of the incorrect references in this paper were ‘fabricated’ in the sense of being made up or false.” She notes that the original manuscript was submitted to the journal with the correct references but “the errors were generated when one of the other authors (without the knowledge of the submitting author) used chatGPT (instead of regular referencing software) to insert the citations and reference list.”</p>



<span id="more-129251"></span>



<p>On April 1, <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/rnr/people/profiles/collier.php">Bret Collier</a>, a wildlife ecologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, wrote to Srinivasan and others, informing them the March 2024 study, titled “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25148486241235821">Breeding distrust: The biopolitics of chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer</a>,” contained several non-existent citations, one to a paper referred to as being published in 2026.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This manuscript was brought to my attention as there are a variety of citations to Wildlife Society journals listed in the literature cited that are incorrectly cited, abjectly false, or obviously manufactured for use in this manuscript,” Collier wrote to the journal and the study authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I cannot speak to the accuracy of other citations nor to the quality of the content presented in the paper, but my brief evaluation indicated that several areas that I checked citations on are also either incorrect or blatantly false,” he added.</p>



<p>The study’s corresponding author, <a href="https://envst.utah.edu/news/faculty_highlight_matt_fry.php">Matthew Fry</a>, a geographer at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, replied to Collier’s email on the same day, noting that he already reported the issue to the journal on March 25 and provided them with the correct references.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Last week we learned that prior to submitting the manuscript to EPE nearly one year ago, the lead author used chatGPT to update the references,” Fry wrote in the email. “I and the other co-author were not aware of this at the time and, unfortunately, never checked those references.”</p>



<p>Fry noted the manuscript drew on the thesis of the lead author, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/-zachtabor-/">Zach Tabor</a>, a former master’s student at the University of North Texas in Denton. “[T]he references in his thesis are correct and accurate,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Fry and Tabor for comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collier wrote in his email: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The use of incorrect or manufactured citations has duplicative impacts on science, in that it restricts our ability to provide the foundational logic to our works, which can lead to the questioning of integrity of scientists across the world.&nbsp; Additionally, manufactured citations impact journal rating metrics and our ability to ensure that readers are getting quality scientific content.</p>

However, largely due to human activities, bee populations are declining worldwide. Almost 35% of invertebrate pollinators, including many bee species are facing extinction. Recognising their importance, the United Nations has designated May the 20th as <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/bee-day">World Bee Day</a>, urging everyone to help protect bees. In response to the call to raise awareness, we highlight research from across the BMC Series.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The insecticide Calypso SC480, which contains the active substance thiacloprid, is used on crops to control insect pests. However, it can be lethal to bees at high concentrations. The European Union (EU) has conducted risk assessments to evaluate the toxicity of insecticides, focusing on the exposure level at which half of the tested bees die. This has led to the development of EU guidelines for pesticide use. However, there has been a lack of research on the sub-lethal effects of lower exposure levels on bees. Lotta Kaila, a doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, conducted a study published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> to investigate the impact of thiacloprid concentrations used in Finnish agriculture on the learning and memory abilities of bumblebees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Learning performance and memory were tested in a ten-colour test in which a bumblebee had to learn to identify the five colours that rewarded it with sugar water. Oral exposure to thiacloprid residues equivalent to concentrations found in honeybee collected pollen and nectar from Finnish fields where thiacloprid was used according to commercial pesticide instructions impaired the bees&#8217; learning performance compared to untreated controls.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The study shows that even small doses of pesticides, which are considered less harmful, can still impact the learning ability of bumblebees and potentially weaken their populations over time. Therefore, it&#8217;s not enough to only look at lethal doses when studying the effects of pesticides on pollinating insects. Sub-lethal doses can also affect the ability of pollinators to find food, which may weaken populations long term. These findings emphasize the need for a better understanding of pesticide residues in the environment and their impact on pollinators. This information can help the scientific community and policymakers improve the sustainable use of pesticides.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Plant Biology </em></strong><em>&#8211; </em><a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-023-04564-6">Global warming impairs the olfactory floral signaling in strawberry</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changes in the scent of flowers, such as those induced by global warming, can impact how appealing plants are to pollinators. Bees rely on their antennae&#8217;s odour sensors to decipher volatile signals released by flowers, helping them locate flowers and assess the quality of their pollen and nectar. A study conducted by Guaraci Duran Cordeiro and Stefan Dötterl from the University of Salzburg, published in </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BMC Plant Biology</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, explores whether changes in the floral scent of strawberry plants due to temperature shifts impacts their attractiveness to bee pollinators.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The researchers used gas chromatography to analyse volatile organic compounds in scent samples and electroantennography to measure the detection of volatiles perceived by the antennal olfactory apparatus of bees to test whether temperature-induced shifts in the floral scent of strawberries affect their attractiveness to bees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>, <em>Bombus terrestris</em>, <em>Osmia </em></span><em>bicornis</em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">). They found that strawberry flowers grown under optimum temperatures (mean 20 °C) released 10.4 ng/flower/hour of scent compounds. However, the flowers did not emit any detectable scent in warmer conditions (mean 25 °C). In behavioural experiments, the bees </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">were attracted</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by the scents emitted under the optimum temperature scenario.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The findings suggest that changes in floral scent emissions due to global warming could potentially impact pollination, adversely affecting ecosystem functioning and crop productivity. The study highlights the need for further research into the influence of temperature-induced changes in floral scent on plant-pollinator chemical communication.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Genomics</em> &#8211; </strong><a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-023-09143-5#Sec1">Differential bumble bee gene expression associated with pathogen infection and pollen diet</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The gut parasite, <em>Crithidia bombi</em>, is commonly found in the bumblebee species <em>Bombus impatiens</em>. This protozoan pathogen is spread among colonies through flowers and is prevalent in Europe, Australasia, and the Americas. While benign in favourable conditions, <em>Crithidia bombi</em> can significantly affect bumblebee health, including reduced colony reproduction and fitness, impaired cognitive abilities, and altered foraging behaviour when combined with other stressors. Recent studies have shown that consuming sunflower pollen (<em>Helianthus annuus</em>) can lessen the severity of the pathogen in <em>Bombus impatiens</em>. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this therapeutic effect are not fully understood.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To help elucidate the medicinal effect, the authors of a study in <em>BMC Genomics</em> analysed the transcriptomes of bumble bee workers to understand the physiological response to sunflower pollen consumption and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">C. bombi </span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">infection. Workers were exposed to parasite cells or control and </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">were fed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> either</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> sunflower or wildflower pollen. The gene expression profiles from their entire abdomens were then sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 technology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sequencing data analysis found that sunflower pollen boosts the expression of genes expressed by immune cells, such as serine proteases and Toll receptors, as well as the transcript encoding the anti-microbial peptide hymenopteran in <em>Crithidia bombi </em>infected bees. Additionally, sunflower pollen upregulates genes associated with detoxification and the maintenance of gut health in both infected and uninfected bees. Further research into understanding host responses that drive the medicinal effect of sunflower pollen in bumble bees may open new avenues for managing bee pathogens.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>BMC Research Notes</strong></em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-023-06495-9">The first ITS2 sequence data set of eDNA from honey of Malaysian giant honeybees (<em>Apis dorsata</em>) and stingless bees (<em>Heterotrigona itama</em>) reveals plant species diversity</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bees gather genetic traces of many organisms belonging to the same community while visiting flowers to collect honey. The authors of a study in <em>BMC Research Notes</em> have generated sequencing datasets to analyze the environmental DNA (eDNA) found in honey collected by two native Malaysian bee species, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apis dorsata</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Heterotrigona itama</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The datasets provide valuable insights into the plant species visited by these bees, shedding light on </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">important</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> plant-pollinator interactions within Malaysian forests. Additionally, investigators can use the datasets to determine the geographical and botanical origins of the honey.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fueled by recent technological advances, researchers are beginning to unlock genetic information in honey for various uses. Using honey as a source of eDNA can help evaluate community composition and answer many questions regarding biotic interactions within ecosystems. For example, eDNA datasets from honey or pollen found on the body of pollinators can help determine plant-pollinator interactions, monitor bee and plant health and detect pathogens and parasites. Such data is also helpful in ascertaining the geographical origin of honey to combat food fraud.</span></p>

<p><em>Retraction Watch readers may recall the story of Paolo Macchiarini, about whom <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/11/26/misconduct-leads-to-retraction-from-italian-super-surgeon-under-house-arrest/">we first wrote in 2012</a> before he became the subject of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/11/29/bad-surgeon-dr-paolo-macchiarini-documentary/71720685007/">international scrutiny</a> &#8212; and who has <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/sweden-says-windpipe-surgeon-can-serve-prison-term-in-spain-6d3f577f">now been sentenced to prison</a>. We are pleased to present an excerpt about the Macchiarini case from&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Thinking+about+Science%3A+Good+Science%2C+Bad+Science%2C+and+How+to+Make+It+Better-p-9781683674344"></a><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324065500">The Occasional Human Sacrifice: Medical Experimentation and the Price of Saying No</a><em>&nbsp;by Carl Elliott published by W. W. Norton, May 2024.</em></p>



<p>One incident illustrates just how determined the leaders of the Karolinska Institute were to protect Paolo Macchiarini. In November of 2014, a leaked copy of the whistleblowers’ report came into the hands of the New York Times, which published an article titled “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/world/leading-surgeon-is-accused-of-misconduct-in-experimental-transplant-operations.html">Leading Surgeon Is Accused of Misconduct in Experimental Transplant Operations</a>.” The article detailed several of the most serious allegations against Macchiarini: that he had never obtained ethical permission to conduct his experiments, that his <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61715-7/fulltext">2011 study in The Lancet</a> had misrepresented the outcome of Beyene’s implant, and that of the three patients at the Karolinska Institute that Macchiarini had given synthetic implants, only Beyene had signed a consent form— and the form was dated two weeks after his surgery. The publicity generated by the article all but forced the Karolinska Institute to act. Anders Hamsten, the vice-chancellor, said he would ask for an external inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retaliation against the whistleblowers came quickly. According to Simonson, the whistleblowers were told that they had violated patient privacy and would be fired immediately. That didn’t happen, but in December the Karolinska Institute informed the whistleblowers that the head of the cardiothoracic clinic would deliver a formal warning, the last step before an employee is terminated.</p>



<p>The Karolinska Institute also reported the whistleblowers to the police. “I was called down to the police and put in a room with no windows, with a tape recorder and a lawyer and a policeman in front of me, and interrogated. That was pretty scary,” Matthias Corbascio, a cardiothoracic surgeons says. “It was exactly what it’s like on television. And you know, it’s hard to be a tough guy in that room.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129207"></span>



<p>The accusations were baseless; the whistleblowers had anonymized all the identities in their report, and Corbascio had applied in advance for ethical permission to access patient records. “I wrote that ethics application because I knew that they were going to try to fire us,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the spring of 2015, the external inquiry Hamsten had promised was completed. Dr. Bengt Gerdin, an emeritus professor at Uppsala University Hospital, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/28/misconduct-found-in-7-papers-by-macchiarini-says-english-write-up-of-investigation/">concluded</a> that Macchiarini was guilty of scientific misconduct. The inquiry didn’t address any potential abuses of human subjects, but the result of the inquiry was clear. Macchiarini had falsified his research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even an external corroboration of misconduct didn’t deter the Karolinska Institute leaders. It took months for them to respond, and when they finally came to a conclusion, they called a press conference. “We asked if we could attend the press conference, and they said no,” Simonson says. “They then called our boss at the time and said that they were hiring guards to stop us from attending.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accompanied by members of the Nobel Committee, Hamsten disavowed Gerdin’s external inquiry and proclaimed his confidence in Macchiarini. The whistleblowers were stunned. Macchiarini responded with gratitude. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/science/paolo-macchiarini-researcher-cleared-of-scientific-misconduct-charges.html">To have been falsely accused of such serious misconduct is every researcher’s nightmare</a>,” he said. The Lancet applauded the decision with an editorial titled “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00118-X/fulltext">Paolo Macchiarini Is Not Guilty of Scientific Misconduct</a>.”</p>



<p>Grinnemo remembers this entire period as a very dark time. The stress was overwhelming. “I mean, I couldn’t sleep. I was always thinking of this next strategic move,” he says. People he considered friends stopped returning his calls and emails. He could not concentrate on his research. He found it hard to give his children the attention they needed. “It was also hard doing surgery, to be standing there focusing on the operation,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thought that he might have sacrificed his career for a futile cause sent him into a panic. Corbascio felt the same way. The hostility at work was palpable. He says, “I think that Kalle and I were like the two most hated people at Karolinska, and I’ve no doubt about that.”</p>

<p>In the late afternoon at a conference in Cartagena last year, a team of Swedish researchers <a href="https://www5.shocklogic.com/client_data/ccsa/uploads/2023%20ISPRM/001_Programa%20ISPRM%202023%20Sin%20Time%20Table_compressed.pdf">presented their work</a> on a technique that uses machine learning to translate the body&#8217;s own electric signals used to move a limb. They had tested it on a minor recovering from a stroke.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/C-2024-0495-EOK-rapport.pdf">Documents from an internal investigation</a> shared by Chalmers University have now revealed, however, that this case study was part of a series of regulatory lapses and suspicious research practices at the Centre for Bionics and Pain Research (CBPR) where the clinical research was conducted. The researchers seem to have conducted the study before Max Ortiz-Catalán, the center’s founder and former manager, had secured regulatory approval from the relevant Swedish agency. </p>



<p>Chalmers, the Centre’s home, has now <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/research-at-the-centre-for-bionics-and-pain-research-is-suspended-and-deficiencies-are-reported-to-regulatory-authorities/">suspended it</a> after also suspecting that its data and research participants seemed “systematically selected” so that treatments appeared effective, and excluded data when treatments caused health problems. The investigation also uncovered the center had no person responsible for compliance, which is a <a href="https://www.lakemedelsverket.se/sv/medicinteknik/tillverka/person-med-ansvar-for-att-regelverket-efterlevs#hmainbody1">requirement under Swedish law</a>, and that personal data had been handled poorly. </p>



<span id="more-129236"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This isn’t the first time CBPR has come under scrutiny for questionable research practices. Two years ago, a divided committee absolved several of its researchers from charges of misconduct after a local newspaper pointed out serious omissions in a published paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2022, <em>Forskning &amp; Framsteg</em> <a href="https://fof.se/artikel/har-ar-armen-forskarna-ville-glomma/#klarna:486a61ba-fd4c-5fac-91c5-65c3478bda93">reported that researchers</a> affiliated with CBPR, again including Ortiz-Catalán, had excluded the life-threatening complications — such as sepsis and infection — experienced by a patient who had received a prosthetic arm. The paper, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1917537?query=featured_home">‘Self-Contained Neuromusculoskeletal Arm Prostheses’</a> published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, had <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/30/mind-controlled-prosthetic-arm-patients-feel-objects/">generated buzz</a> for its advances in ‘mind-controlled’ prosthetic limbs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CBPR had conducted the research in collaboration with Swedish prosthetics company, Integrum. When the deficiencies in the paper were first reported, Integrum CEO Rickard Brånemark said the omissions were “regrettable” and that the authors’ intention was not to hide information, since the complications had been reported at conferences. A month later, in October 2022, the authors published a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMx220013">lengthy correction</a> explaining the patient’s adverse events.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But when the correction was published, an investigation into alleged falsification was still underway. Chalmers University had submitted a case to Sweden’s national board for research misconduct one day after the newspaper’s report, followed by the University of Gothenburg submitting the same suspicions to the board a month later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors argued that the patient who experienced the life-threatening complications had received a different kind of prosthetic arm, and that they had intended to publish the medical complications in a subsequent paper, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Decision-in-case-3.1-22-0118_0137_web.pdf">according to the board&#8217;s decision</a> published in June 2023. The authors also claim the Journal’s editor wanted the patient to be included, despite the team’s initial plan to exclude them from the paper because of issues with follow-up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The board found the authors not guilty of research misconduct, though three members dissented, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When the article was ready for publication, the authors knew about the complications that affected Patient 4. However, the reasons why Patient 4, who is mentioned in several places in the article, was excluded are not made clear and the context in which complications arose is not knowable either…</p>



<p>We consider it was gross negligence not to report the complications that arose in one of the few research participants included in the study described in the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ortiz-Catalán left CBPR while an internal investigation was being carried out due to “issues in his leadership,” media relations manager Henrik Dahlberg wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. “I won’t go into any detail here,” he added. Ortiz-Catalán has since moved to Australia, where he works at the Bionics Institute in Melbourne.&nbsp; He has not responded to several requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">New information about operational issues at CBPR came from a staff tip-off in March 2024, prompting the latest internal investigation at Chalmers that has resulted in the center’s suspension. “The ethics committee decided that they needed to investigate, since what had been revealed indicated irregularities in the research that had been carried out at CBPR,” Dahlberg wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigators examined 50 publications that were published between 2020 and 2024 which include Ortiz-Catalán as an author. They found a large number of ethical permits, but only one regulatory permit since the CBPR was formed — dated several weeks after researchers had presented their clinical case study at the conference in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also noted a lack of legal agreement between Integrum, the company that collaborated in the 2020 study, and Chalmers University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is our assessment that the activities at CBPR violate the law regarding regulatory permits.” the investigators wrote, noting that this carries a maximum imprisonment of two years according to Swedish law. “In addition, there is a suspicion that they do not comply with the European regulations for medical devices and do not live up to the Declaration of Helsinki,” the report continues. The investigators also found issues with security in the management of personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While the investigation focused on whether permits were in place for the work, the report suggests that data was selected to appear favorable to the treatments. Chalmers and the other collaborating institutions — the University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital — agreed to suspend CBPR’s operations and have asked Swedish research authorities to review work from the group dating back to 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to questions about whether this affects research produced collaboratively between Integrum and CBPR, Integrum CEO Rickard Brånemark wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The NEJM article you refer to has already been thoroughly re-examined, after which a correction was published on November 1, 2022. Moreover, an academic research evaluation confirmed that no misconduct had been committed. I feel confident that everything in that paper is correct and balanced. To my current knowledge, there are no reasons to correct or retract any of the other articles I have co-authored with researchers at CBPR. Should the evaluation following the closure of CBPR find any inconsistencies in any publication, we will of course make sure to correct these.</p>

                <p>This coming <strong>Wednesday, May 22, 2024</strong>, the arXiv editorial staff will be attending a team development retreat. Because all editorial staff will be participating in this professional development, it will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This brief change will only affect the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>The arXiv team primarily takes time off according to the holiday schedule of the United States. In the coming months, there are a few US federal holidays that will cause some disruption to arXiv’s regular announcements, mailings, and user support.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As you plan your submissions to arXiv in the coming weeks and months, please be aware of the delays around the following dates. Mailings and public availability of new submissions will be deferred accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wednesday, May 22, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Tuesday, May 21, 2024, and before 14:00ET Thursday May 23, 2024 will be announced on Thursday, May 23, 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, Jun 19, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Tuesday, June 18, 2024, and before 14:00ET Thursday June 20, 2024 will be announced on Thursday, June 20, 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday, July 4, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Wednesday, July 3, 2024, and before 14:00ET Friday July 5, 2024 will be announced on Sunday, July 7, 2024.</li>

<p>In 2019, Filippo Berto <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning/flest-innvandrere-pa-publiseringstoppen-blant-norske-forskere/119288">was hailed</a> as Norway’s most productive researcher, publishing a new study on average every two to three days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years on, a committee appointed by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), where Berto, a mechanical engineer, was based until last year, is recommending that the institution carries out an in-depth investigation into his work following a complaint by Per Steineide Refseth, a librarian at the Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences in Rena.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rune Nydal, a philosopher at NTNU who leads the independent research integrity committee that met May 14 partly to discuss the complaint about Berto’s work, told <em>Retraction Watch </em>it is recommending NTNU’s rector conduct an in-depth probe into Berto’s papers and release a public statement on the outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129227"></span>



<p>The recommendation was first <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/fakultet-for-ingeniorvitenskap-filippo-berto-forskningsetikk/anbefaler-uavhengig-granskning-av-varsler-mot-filippo-berto/406642">reported yesterday by NTNU&#8217;s student newspaper</a>.</p>



<p>Berto is accused of <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/196F5E84F5104AF5B15DE5CA0D22C6">publishing duplicate studies</a> in multiple journals, including <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A6354397676E94CAB9658CAB57D139">references to irrelevant studies</a>, and producing articles that contain keywords from advertisements from <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">paper mills</a>, which sell authorships and citations on bogus or subpar studies in exchange for a fee. By our count, Berto, who has <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning/flest-innvandrere-pa-publiseringstoppen-blant-norske-forskere/119288">reportedly expressed</a> aspirations to become Europe’s most productive researcher, has at least five retractions to his name. </p>



<p>While the NTNU cannot sanction Berto since he no longer works there, Nydal noted that “any statement from the university is also a sanction.” He added that, “it’s in the institution’s interest in clarifying what happened and what the extent of [the problem] is.”</p>



<p>In September 2023, Berto moved to the Sapienza University of Rome in Italy. <em>Retraction Watch</em> has approached Sapienza and Berto for comments. &nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://bibliotek.usn.no/publication-points/category26628.html">A policy in Norway</a> now under review allows institutions in the country to benefit financially from the Ministry of Education and Research for every paper produced by their faculty and staff. <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning/flest-innvandrere-pa-publiseringstoppen-blant-norske-forskere/119288">According to NTNU’s student paper</a>, in 2022, an average academic at Norwegian institutions accumulated 1.25 publication points. By comparison, between 2019 and 2022, <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/filippo-berto-forskningsetikk-forskningsjuks/norges-mestpubliserende-forsker-granskes-for-alvorlige-brudd-pa-etiske-normer/403870">Berto earned</a> 407.08 publication points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will be up to the NTNU rector whether the institution will return the money the institution has received from the ministry directly as a result of Berto’s papers, Nydal said, adding that the amount is a significant sum. “It’s a more serious case here than the question of the money,” he said. “It’s a matter of [alleged] misuse of the publication system.”</p>



<p>“Researchers are evaluated too much based on how much they have published instead of the quality of what they have published, and that the Norwegian publication points system may have contributed to this,” Refseth, who has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/29/norway-demotes-hindawi-journals-after-claims-one-published-a-stolen-paper/">been involved in other research integrity efforts</a> in the past, told us. “I support changing the system of publication-based funding in Norway.”</p>



<p>But Nydal said academia has enough incentives for researchers to continuously churn out papers even without the policy being in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Refseth’s complaint only flagged 17 or 18 studies, Berto authored hundreds more papers during his stint at NTNU. According to Google Scholar, Berto published 871 studies between the 2018 and 2023 calendar years. </p>



<p>“It certainly doesn’t look good,” Nydal said. “It’s an enormous amount of papers.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">To date, Berto has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Filippo+Berto">28 papers flagged on PubPeer</a>, 11 of which were added within the last month. Many of the comments on the site are from Angus Wilkinson, a materials scientist at the University of Oxford, in England, who said he came across a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A6354397676E94CAB9658CAB57D139">March 2023 PubPeer post</a> by scientific sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Nick Wise</a>, a fluid dynamics researcher at the University of Cambridge, in England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that post, Wise noted that the paper in question contains keywords from a Telegram advert offering to sell citations. “I’ve looked through the introduction section of this paper and suggest that ~65% of the papers cited are inappropriate for the subject area of the text,” wrote Wilkinson, whose area of expertise is the same as Berto, in response to Wise on PubPeer in November 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That 2022 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167844222003172">paper</a>, “Effects of tensile overload on fatigue crack growth in AM60 magnesium alloys,” has since been retracted by <em>Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics. </em>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167844222003172">retraction notice</a> issued in December 2022 reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor in Chief.</p>



<p>After a thorough investigation, the Editor in Chief has concluded that this article must be retracted due to serious errors, such as including 24 inappropriate references, a duplication of Figure 13 from Figure 14 and changes of authorship without the approval of the Editor in Chief.</p>



<p>The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As a consequence, Berto no longer serves on the editorial board of <em>Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics</em>. According to <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/filippo-berto-forskningsetikk-forskningsjuks/norges-mestpubliserende-forsker-granskes-for-alvorlige-brudd-pa-etiske-normer/403870">NTNU’s student newspaper</a>, Berto has also been removed from the editorial boards of <em>the International Journal of Fatigue </em>and <em>Engineering Failure Analysis</em>, which have also retracted papers by him, for similar reasons.</p>



<p><em>Engineering Failure Analysis </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350630721003174">retracted a 2021 study</a>, “An investigation on fatigue behavior of AA2024 aluminum alloy sheets in fuselage lap joints,” by Berto and colleagues for “duplication of text and methodology, as well as salami slicing of research results.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile <em>The International Journal of Fatigue</em> has also retracted a 2021 study by Berto and colleagues, titled “Reliability analysis of fatigue crack growth for rail steel under variable amplitude service loading conditions and wear.” According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142112321003091">retraction note</a>, issued in November 2021, the paper duplicates “significant parts” of another already published study.</p>



<p><em>Fatigue &amp; Fracture of Engineering Materials &amp; Structures</em> has retracted the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ffe.12616">2017 study</a>, “Fracture investigation of U-notch made of tungsten–copper functionally graded materials by means of strain energy density.” Its <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ffe.13692">retraction note</a> says that the paper was pulled in agreement with the authors because it has “considerable overlap with a previously published article.”</p>



<p>Berto and colleagues also retracted <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/564816363/10-1007-s11223-017-9884-2">a study</a>, “Fatigue Assessment of Ti-6Al-4V Circular Notched Specimens Produced by Selective Laser Melting,” published by <em>Strength of Materials</em>, noting in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/01D9EC6D8EE20A2A30E6A3BD072791">the retraction notice</a> that the paper has already been published elsewhere.</p>

<p>The study of skeletal development in mammalian species is difficult due to the technical and ethical challenges of collecting embryonic material. Fortunately, natural history museums contain broad collections that often include prenatal specimens.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors took advantage of one such museum collection to study ossification (bone formation) in 15 specimens from six species of mammalian carnivores: sea lion, mongoose, lion, fox, bear, and civet. They used micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to non-invasively evaluate the extent of bone formation in each specimen and were able to determine the order of ossification in these species.</p>
<p>The authors found that most of the species conformed to known ossification sequences of either canine or feline clades of carnivores, but that the sequence for sea lions diverged. They suggest that sea lion&#8217;s aquatic environment has affected prenatal development to differ from land mammals&#8217;.</p>

<p>Prediction of future COVID-19 waves is crucial to support decision-making regarding vaccine allocation and public health policy. However, many of the models used do not take into account effects of both vaccination and prior infections.</p>
<p>To address these shortcomings, the authors of this paper created predictive models that consider how combinations of vaccination and prior Omicron infection will protect populations from near-future outbreaks of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. They also considered population age demographics and the context of public health measures to reduce infection (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>They found that a variety of factors, including demography, health systems capacity, and vaccine efficacy, had critical effects on the benefits of vaccination and past infection in outbreak prevention. Understanding the interplay between these factors will be useful for tailoring outbreak prevention efforts.</p>

Laws on assisted dying vary around the world, and devising a new law for the UK is a complex matter. Issues to be considered include patient autonomy and protection of the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Twycross presents three different models of assisted dying legal in different countries with different requirements for patient eligibility. He then presents a &#8216;least worse&#8217; model with minimal physician involvement. Importantly, palliative-hospice care should not be involved, as some patient may decline to use such care for fear of overuse of drugs.</p>

<p>Prolonged sitting is known to be associated with numerous negative health outcomes, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Coffee, on the other hand, has been shown to be associated with reduced mortality. How these two common factors interact and balance is not known.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors studied the joint associations of daily sitting time and coffee intake with mortality from all-cause and CVD in nationally representative sample from the United States of America. Data on daily sitting time and coffee consumption for over ten thousand adults were included.</p>
<p>As expected, the authors found that longer sitting time and higher coffee consumption had opposite associations with mortality. Interestingly, the joint analysis showed that the association between higher sitting time and increased mortality was only present among adults who didn&#8217;t drink coffee, indicating a possible protective effect of coffee consumption.</p>

<p>Male partner involvement in antenatal care (ANC) is known to improve maternal outcomes as well as provide opportunities for HIV testing and counselling for men who might not otherwise have healthcare system contact. Generally, pregnant women invite their partners to attend ANC and HIV testing, but uptake is low.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors report the results of a randomized controlled trial that used a mobile phone intervention and clinic staff invitations to partners of women who attended ANC alone. Outcomes included male partner attendance at later ANC visits and utilization of HIV testing of male partners after the invitation.</p>
<p>The results showed that mobile phone invitations from clinic staff had a positive effect on both male partner ANC attendance and male partner HIV testing. This is a promising strategy to enhance male partner involvement in maternal care and improve health outcomes.</p>

<p>A group of researchers is taking <em>Nature </em>to task for publishing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w">paper</a> earlier this month about Google DeepMind’s protein folding prediction program without requiring the authors publish the code behind the work.</p>



<p>Roland Dunbrack, of Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, peer-reviewed the paper but was “not given access to code during the review,” the authors of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6ioZPbxiDZy5h4qxo-bHa0XOTOxEYHObht0SX8EgwfPHY_g/viewform">letter submitted today</a>, May 14, to <em>Nature</em> – including Dunbrack – write, “despite repeated requests.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01385-x"><em>Nature</em> podcast</a> said AlphaFold3 – unlike AlphaFold2 – “can accurately predict protein-molecule complexes containing DNA, RNA and more. Although the new version is restricted to non-commercial use, researchers are excited by its greater range of predictive abilities and the prospect of speedier drug discovery.”</p>



<span id="more-129223"></span>



<p>Not everyone was excited. The authors of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6ioZPbxiDZy5h4qxo-bHa0XOTOxEYHObht0SX8EgwfPHY_g/viewform">letter, which co-author Stephanie A. Wankowicz of the University of California, San Francisco told Retraction Watch was submitted today to Nature</a>, write they “were disappointed with the lack of code, or even executables accompanying the publication of AlphaFold3 in <em>Nature</em>.” They continue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Although AlphaFold3 expands AlphaFold2’s capacities to include small molecules, nucleic acids, and chemical modifications, it was released without the means to test and use the software in a high-throughput manner. This does not align with the principles of scientific progress, which rely on the ability of the community to evaluate, use, and build upon existing work. The high-profile publication advertises capabilities that remain locked behind the doors of the parent company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors, who are circulating the letter for additional signatures, write that “the model&#8217;s limited availability on a hosted web server, capped at ten predictions per day, restricts the scientific community&#8217;s capacity to verify the broad claims of the findings or apply the predictions on a large scale. Specifically, the inability to make predictions on novel organic molecules akin to chemical probes and drugs, one of the central claims of the paper, makes it impossible to test or use this method.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01383-z">May 8 news story</a> by the independent team of journalists at <em>Nature</em> noted the restrictions. <em>Nature</em> editor in chief Magdalena Skipper told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>Nature</em> has a long-standing <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards#availability-of-computer-code">policy</a> designed to facilitate the availability of data, materials and code upon reasonable request. While seeking to enhance transparency at every opportunity, <em>Nature</em> accepts that there may be circumstances under which research data or code are not openly available. When making a decision on data and code availability, we reflect on many different factors, including the potential implications for biosecurity and the ethical challenges this presents. In such cases we work with the authors to provide alternatives that will support reproducibility, for example through the provision of pseudocode, which is made available to the reviewers during peer review.</p>



<p>As noted in the code availability statement in the paper: AlphaFold 3 is available as a non-commercial usage only server at <a href="https://www.alphafoldserver.com/">https://www.alphafoldserver.com</a>, with restrictions on allowed ligands and covalent modifications. Pseudocode describing the algorithms is available in the Supplementary Information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pseudocode, however, “will require months of effort to turn into workable code that approximates the performance, wasting valuable time and resources,” the authors of the letter write. “Even if such a reimplementation is attempted, restricted access raises questions about whether the results could be fully validated.”</p>



<p>The authors of the letter continue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When journals fail to enforce their written policies about <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards">making code available to reviewers</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/initial-submission">alongside publications</a>, they demonstrate how these policies are applied inequitably and how editorial decisions do not align with the needs of the scientific community. While there is an ever-changing landscape of how science is performed and communicated, journals should uphold their role in the community by ensuring that science is reproducible upon dissemination, regardless of who the authors are.</p>

<p>A professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia who once served as a dean at the Stevens Institute of Technology in the United States, has received expressions of concern on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText=expression%20of%20concern&amp;highlight=true&amp;returnFacets=ALL&amp;returnType=SEARCH&amp;matchPubs=true&amp;refinements=Author:Yehia%20Massoud&amp;refinements=Author:Y.%20Massoud">93 of his conference proceedings</a> for what a publisher said were irrelevant self-citations and “artificially inflating the number of citations.”</p>



<p>The notes by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) on the work of Yehia Massoud, a professor of electrical and computer engineering,  take two forms. One reads:</p>



<span id="more-129216"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Expression of Concern: Concerns were raised regarding the high number of self-citations included by the authors in the reference section of this article. A subsequent review of the citations by a duly constituted committee found that many are irrelevant to the work presented in the article, and that the addition of these citations artificially increased the citation impact of one of the authors of the article, Yehia Massoud. The addition of irrelevant self-citations is a violation of IEEE’s Publication Principles and community standards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Notes: Expression of Concern: After careful consideration by a duly constituted committee, an author of this article, Yehia Massoud, was found to have acted in violation of the IEEE Publication Principles by artificially inflating the number of citations to the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The EOCs were posted in mid-March, IEEE told Retraction Watch. All of the papers were published more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Massoud, who according to his <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/itl/people/person/yehia-massoud">bio</a> remains a fellow of the IEEE, told Retraction Watch he disagrees with the EOCs and is “exploring various avenues to have these expressions reconsidered:”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I respectfully disagree with the IEEE’s expressions, which amount to a difference of opinion on a subjective matter. These expressions relate to papers that were peer reviewed and editorially accepted for publication more than a decade ago. The inclusion of self-references in these papers was appropriate and is a common practice in pioneering fields for completeness, research continuity and transparency. I am exploring options to have these expressions of concern reconsidered and removed, including by working collaboratively with IEEE on a mutually agreeable resolution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Massoud had an <em>IEEE </em>paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6144484">retracted</a> sometime around 2012 for similar reasons as part of a massive purge of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.362.6413.393">some 7,000 articles</a>. As his bio notes:</p>



<p>Prior to Stevens, he served as the head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) between 2012 and 2017. During that period, the ECE department saw a considerable growth in research expenditures, research output, industrial partnerships, undergraduate and graduate student enrollments, unrestricted funds and gifts, and recognition. The department also rose 26 positions in the U.S. News &amp; World Report department rankings.</p>



<p>Such rankings, as <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1887">we’ve noted</a>, rely heavily on citation metrics.</p>

<p>A study published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth </em>explored the experiences of mothers of infants with orofacial clefts in Uganda, with the occurrence of cleft in children known to lead to feeding difficulties and malnutrition. The authors assessed the breastfeeding history of children with a cleft between 0 to 24 months old, including the use of prelacteal feeds, breast milk alternatives and feeding devices used.</p>
<p>Mothers of children with a cleft were invited to complete a survey and attend focus group discussions to explore their experiences of breastfeeding and the support they received. The study involved 32 mother-child pairs, with 25 mothers participating in the qualitative focus group and interviews. Participants frequently expressed difficulties with breastfeeding, with the use of cow’s milk often reported as an alternative due to the high cost of formula milk. The use of feeding devices was also frequently reported. Whilst participants indicated that family members and the hospital could provide social and feeding support, they also reported experiencing negative attitudes and social stigmatization from the community and shared concerns about their risk of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>The authors conclude improved national breastfeeding guidelines and encouraging mothers to share experiences via support groups may help reduce difficulties and improve psycho-social outcomes.</p>

<p>An article published in <em>BMC Oral Health</em> describes the development of a questionnaire to evaluate the understanding of cleft lip and palate (CLP) amongst recent dental graduates. In this study, a questionnaire to assess knowledge of CLP, early interventions, interdisciplinary care, and management options was developed and validated using three groups of subject matter experts, including orthodontists, paediatric dentists, and surgeons. The questionnaire was distributed to a cohort of graduates between the ages of 23 and 30 who were enrolled in a dental internship in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The authors identified that whilst graduates demonstrated a strong understanding of how to treat and manage CLP from a dental perspective, knowledge gaps were identified in aspects of care relating to possible risk factors and post-surgical complications. Additionally, whilst graduates identified the importance of interprofessional collaboration when managing CLP, knowledge of the specific roles of specialised healthcare professionals was not expressed by participants.</p>
<p>The authors propose that these knowledge gaps may be addressable by developing bespoke training and practical sessions during undergraduate education.</p>

<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an increased shift towards online and hybrid learning by higher education institutions, facilitating distance learning in undergraduate medical education. Whilst this has led to benefits such as the increased accessibility and geographical dissemination of resources and flexibility in learning options for students, online learning may be a barrier to education in regions with disparities in adequate internet access.</p>
<p>This study explored the outcomes of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on cleft lip and palate developed for undergraduate students in Indonesia in collaboration with Smile Train.  414 out of 717 participants completed the MOOC, with course competing students providing positive feedback about the course’s content and the support they received from teachers when enrolled. Challenges identified by students included difficulties with internet access, course scheduling and that some of the topics were perceived as being too advanced, which provides feedback for further course re-assignments.</p>
<p>Continued development of e-learning resources for undergraduate curricula may enhance the geographical dissemination of medical education and future quality of care in low resource settings, particularly for topics with known knowledge gaps such as cleft lip and palate.</p>

<p>The ability to generate high-quality images is a crucial part of surgical planning, for example when performing alveolar bone grafting for unilateral cleft lip and palate. Whilst traditional two-dimensional X-rays can be used, they may lack the detail required for precise planning. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans provide a comprehensive view of facial structures for alveolar bone graft, enabling surgeons to plan the grafting procedure more accurately and assess post-surgery outcomes.</p>
<p>The authors of a study in <em>BMC Oral Health</em> describe the application of a machine learning model using 3D U-net to automatically detect morphometric changes in scans taken before and after secondary alveolar bone grafting to assess the impact on the growth and development of the maxilla post-surgery. The study involved the analysis of archived images from 32 patients who had not previously undergone surgery or orthodontic treatment. Using the improved efficiency and accuracy of the machine learning model, the authors observed differences in growth trends between the cleft and non-cleft sides of the maxilla following surgery, with secondary alveolar bone grafting appearing to have a positive effect on the length of the maxilla and alveolar ridge, but limited benefit to the height and width of the maxilla on the cleft side.</p>
<p>More in-depth image analysis with machine learning methods may help improve surgical outcomes and inform better treatment approaches.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524008816">One of the notices</a>, published online April 11 in <em>Chemosphere</em>, reads, for example:</p>



<span id="more-129212"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been brought to the attention of the journal regarding:</p>



<ul>
<li>unusual changes to the authorship of the article prior to publication.</li>



<li>potential undisclosed conflicts of interest by a reviewer.</li>



<li>potential undisclosed conflicts of interest by the editor who handled the peer-review process for the article.</li>
</ul>



<p>The journal editors are investigating the article, including contacting the authors, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and Elsevier&#8217;s policies.</p>



<p>The Expression of Concern will remain appended to the article until the investigation has been completed. If the editors can reach a conclusion, they will take any action that is deemed necessary. If the editors have determined that they cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion with the information available to them, a further notification will be published to update the community.</p>

<p>Sleuths have flagged dozens of publications in <em>Chemosphere</em>. In December, for instance, an anonymous PubPeer comment listed several papers that were “part of a potential breach in the publication ethics as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/87A4CAC90B526F773F36C93BC737B4">the editor is linked with the authors</a>.” In other cases, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/32B04AD9A0235DD21932848B9CF773">the handling editor was also an author</a> of the paper, another post pointed out.</p>



<p>The notices started to appear online in March. Papers in both special&nbsp; and regular issues of the journal seem to be affected.</p>
