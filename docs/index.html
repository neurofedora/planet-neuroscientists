                Every year, peatlands in the Arctic suddenly ignite. Smoldering subterranean fires from the previous summer were thought to be to blame, but now modeling suggests a worrying new cause.

<p>Elsevier’s <em>Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy</em> has retracted eight articles for image manipulation and overlap, with more on the way, according to the sleuth who notified the publication of the issues.</p>



<p>Each retraction notice credits an “anonymous reader” with having raised concerns about manipulated or duplicated images, with the journal’s editor in chief determining a retraction was warranted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That anonymous reader was <a href="https://www.igm.columbia.edu/profile/mu-yang-phd">Mu Yang</a>, an assistant professor of neurobiology at Columbia University, in New York City, who started emailing the journal about problematic papers in January 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 16th, the journal notified Yang of the following retractions: </p>

</div></div>



<p>We found another paper retracted the same day:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061823001072">“Gelatin/polyethylene glycol-loaded magnesium hydroxide nanocomposite to attenuate acetylcholinesterase, neurotoxicity, and activation of GPR55 protein in rat models of Alzheimer’s disease,” [2023]</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The retracted articles have been cited a total of six times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The retractions come after the journal’s founding editor and former editor in chief <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/hwm-steinbusch">Sir Harry W.M. Steinbusch</a> stepped down in January of this year. “I think that says a lot,” Yang told Retraction Watch. She felt the depth of his investigations were often lacking and “inappropriate.” After he stepped down and the new editor in chief took over, things didn’t seem to get much better, Yang said, but she acknowledged that the journal is trying to raise their standards.</p>



<p>Steinbusch initially agreed to an interview with Retraction Watch, but cancelled a short time later. We emailed the current editor in chief, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-chemical-neuroanatomy">Goran Šimić</a>, and heard back from a spokesperson for Elsevier, who stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are currently investigating these papers and do not have any further information at this time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zOc6u6sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Kingsley Afoke Iteire</a>, a vice-dean and senior lecturer at the University of Medical Sciences in Ondo, Nigeria, and the corresponding author of one of the retracted <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061823000789">papers</a>, told us one of his co-authors used PowerPoint to resize the offending images, but this shouldn’t have distorted them.</p>



<p>Replacing the images instead of retracting the paper would have been a better decision, Iteire said, and he speculates the previous editor wouldn’t made as harsh a decision. “It&#8217;s likely to discourage mostly early career researchers like us, coming from this side of the world, where we cannot compete favorably with the global North for public grants. We are honest researchers, even though we are from Africa, with low income.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding author of another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061823000984">paper</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=R8kvh4UAAAAJ">Mohammad Ali Azarbayjani</a>, a professor of exercise physiology at the Islamic Azad University in Tehran, Iran, said he had not made “any changes or manipulations” to the flagged images, which were obtained from methods carried out by the external lab <a href="https://histogene.ir/">Histogenotech</a>. Azarbayjani said he “had no role in its implementation, and I took the results from the laboratory and adjusted the article based on the report of that laboratory.”</p>



<p>“Professor Goran Šimić told me because of my honesty in replying to the journal that if I could solve the problem with the images, they would give me the opportunity to resubmit the article,” Azarbayjani told<em> </em>Retraction Watch. With the new images added and based on his statistical analysis, “there has been no change in the quality and trend of the results (although the quantity of the data has changed slightly due to the change in the staining technique),” he said.</p>



<p>The corresponding authors of the other retracted papers did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>Yang is more <a href="https://x.com/mumumouse2/status/1793237110264037713">concerned </a>about a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0891061821000934?via%3Dihub">paper</a> that hasn’t yet been retracted by the journal, which she says contains “heavy” image manipulation. In Steinbusch’s correspondence with the authors of this paper, he pointed out “irregularities” in Figure 8 and  asked them their “opinion” about the mistake and whether they preferred the figure to be removed or changed. The corresponding authors did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>In an email seen by Retraction Watch, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gailmrodney/">Gail M. Rodney</a>, a senior publisher at Elsevier, told Yang more retractions are “forthcoming.” Rodney told her the journal will now analyze every figure before a submission is sent out to review and apologized on behalf of the publisher for “failing the neuroscience community.”</p>

In the tweet, Digdowiseiso wrote that after an internal meeting with UMT, the institution decided the authorship allegations were “a personal issue” and therefore didn’t need “further intervention/action from both universities or even faculties.” Another UNAS <a href="https://x.com/UNAS1949/status/1779475726003212377">tweet from April 14</a> that is still online does not include this paragraph. </p>



<span id="more-129317"></span>



<p>Now, a team UNAS formed to investigate the issue the same day he resigned found several “incriminating” factors and concluded Digdowiseiso “committed a misconduct of academic ethics, scientific propriety, as well as integrity violation as a lecturer,” according to a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/UNIVERSITAS-NASIONAL-PRESS-RELEASE_English_Prof-Kumba_Rev.290504.docx.pdf">university press release</a>. The team recommended his dismissal from his position as dean, and has barred him from lecturing at UNAS for a maximum of three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digdowiseiso had previously contested our reporting as “one-sided” and said publishing it, as well as his photo, without his permission was “completely wrong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the press release, Digdowiseiso will be required to publicly apologize to the affected lecturers at UMT, remove their names from the implicated papers and pursue retractions for those articles. The affected UMT researchers we had previously spoken to have not responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigating team opted against harsher penalties, on the grounds this incident was his “first offence and [he] never has been found to commit any other violations.”</p>



<p>They added they may review the decision if Digdowiseiso shows “good academic ethics”. The press release also stated Digdowiseiso did not include the flagged papers in his application for a professorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we asked him to comment on the developments, Digdowiseiso wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am unable to comment on the results of the TPF [the investigating team formed by UNAS] and Chancellor&#8217;s decisions. You may request information from UNAS as an institution, which I am unable to provide.</p>



<p>TPF only contacted me for explanation once, on April 27, 2024. The clarification lasted three hours, and TPF did not ask for any additional information. TPF then summoned witnesses and reported the findings to the Chancellor.</p>



<p>Throughout the development of this case, I did not speak to the media and protected UNAS as an institution because I wanted the issue to be settled properly.</p>



<p>I have submitted an application to become inactive as a permanent lecturer at UNAS on May 14, 2024. Moreover, in compliance with the Chancellor&#8217;s direction, I already apologized to UMT for procedural errors and miscommunication in a letter dated May 22, 2024.</p>



<p>Finally, I ask that you not escalate this problem because we want to resolve it appropriately.</p>

<p>A former professor and vice provost for research at the Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in New York, falsified data in two published papers, according to <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-mousa-shaker">findings</a> from the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI).</p>



<p>Shaker Mousa, who was also chairman and executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research Institute at Albany, already has at least 10 retractions and two corrections, by <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dMousa%252c%2bShaker%2bA">our count</a>. </p>



<p>The falsified data appeared in “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2217/nnm.12.200">Tetraiodothyroacetic acid-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles: a nanomedicine approach to treat drug-resistant breast cancer,</a>” which appeared in <em>Nanomedicine</em> in 2013, and “<a href="https://journals.lww.com/cardiovascularpharm/fulltext/2005/09000/the_proangiogenic_action_of_thyroid_hormone.17.aspx">The proangiogenic action of thyroid hormone analogue GC-1 is initiated at an integrin,” which appeared in the <em>Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology</em> in 2005 and was retracted last September</a>. ORI called for Mousa to request a correction or retraction of the <em>Nanomedicine</em> paper as well.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129311"></span>



<p>The ORI found seven micrograph panels appeared in both the <em>Nanomedicine</em> and <em>Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology</em> papers and were relabeled to “report pro-angiogenic factors as alternate pro-angiogenic factors, anti-angiogenic drug treatments as alternate anti-angiogenic drug treatments, and control treatments and anti-angiogenic treatments as the same treatment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings relate to research funded by two grants. One, on which Mousa was the sole principal investigator from 2009-2010, received nearly $375,000 in funding. The other grant awarded over $6 million from 1997-2020 to Thomas Scanlan, a professor at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, as principal investigator. Mousa received nearly $1.9 million in total funding as sole principal investigator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s findings follow <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/08B9F69210C010F574B92EC02C9E07?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome#">comments on PubPeer</a> from 2022, when commenter “Actinopolyspora biskrensis” compared images from the 2013 <em>Nanomedicine</em> paper with those that appeared in another Mousa paper from 2009, “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35983480/">The anti-angiogenic activity of NSITC, a specific cathepsin L inhibitor</a>.” The latter was <a href="https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/43/10/4780.long">retracted</a> in October 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mousa, whose work attracted <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/07/11/shaker-mousa-ny-pharma-gangsta/">other scrutiny</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/08B9F69210C010F574B92EC02C9E07#2">defended</a> the recurring image by claiming it was the result of using the same positive control, FGF2, in both studies: “That is why you see the same representative FGF2-mediated stimulation of angiogenesis selected in both reports.”</p>



<p>Actinopolyspora also commented on the 2005 paper from the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/cardiovascularpharm/fulltext/2005/09000/the_proangiogenic_action_of_thyroid_hormone.17.aspx"><em>Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology</em></a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/EDC5782C2E220C4508B1AAB9CB2C6E?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Chrome">suggesting</a> images from it appeared in two of Mousa’s later papers, “<a href="https://journals.lww.com/cardiovascularpharm/fulltext/2005/09000/the_proangiogenic_action_of_thyroid_hormone.17.aspx">Fluorinated Analogs of Organosulfur Compounds from Garlic (<em>Allium sativum</em>): Synthesis, Chemistry and Anti-Angiogenesis and Antithrombotic Studies</a>,” which was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36771183/">corrected</a> in January 2023, and “<a href="https://www.dovepress.com/nanoformulated-bioactive-compounds-derived-from-different-natural-prod-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJN">Nanoformulated Bioactive Compounds Derived from Different Natural Products Combat Pancreatic Cancer Cell Proliferation</a>,” which was <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/retraction-nanoformulated-bioactive-compounds-derived-from-different-n-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJN">retracted</a> in August 2022. Mousa did not respond on PubPeer.</p>



<p>Mousa has not yet responded to our requests for comment. As part of a settlement with ORI, he agreed to have his research supervised for four years and will not serve on federal committees, boards, or peer review committees during that time.</p>

<p>Last May, Devrim Çavuşoğlu, an engineer at Turkish software company OBSS, was looking at feedback from a conference reviewer of a paper he and his colleagues had submitted. One comment stood out to him: The reviewer had noticed a resemblance between Çavuşoğlu’s work and another paper accepted to a different conference on computational linguistics. </p>



<p>When Çavuşoğlu first skimmed through the other paper, he came across some sections containing an uncanny resemblance to his own ideas. “I thought, it’s like I wrote that,” he recalled. “How could it be so similar, did we think about the same thing?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He checked the accompanying source code and found the authors of the other paper seemed to have directly copied and built upon his own publicly released code without any attribution – a violation of the license connected to the work. “I was shocked, to be honest,” Çavuşoğlu told Retraction Watch.</p>



<span id="more-129288"></span>



<p>In July 2021, Çavuşoğlu and his team had publicly released their software, <em>jury, </em>on the code-hosting platform GitHub. The software, designed to assess the quality of natural language generation models, was licensed to allow others to use it with attribution. They decided to submit a paper describing their work for a conference in early 2023 and received comments from the conference reviewer a few months later in May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plagiarized paper appeared in October 2022 — in the period between when Çavuşoğlu and his team released the code and submitted the paper about the work. They were not aware of the other paper, according to Çavuşoğlu. “<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.306.pdf">NLG-Metricverse: An End-to-End Library for Evaluating Natural Language Generation</a>,” was published by five authors from the University of Bologna in Italy, and <a href="https://github.com/disi-unibo-nlp/nlg-metricverse">describes software</a> the authors claim to have created. They make reference to Çavuşoğlu’s project in the paper, but at the time of publishing, failed to disclose they had used his existing code in their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Çavuşoğlu flagged the similarities with the conference committee that had accepted the paper. It took eight months and several follow ups from Çavuşoğlu for the committee to decide to retract. The notice on the source code appeared just last week on May 21, stating that the retraction was “per publication chair request.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Last August, Çavuşoğlu <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cpdIcoBHbFBv0U_OYjsANvhHCWZSPdwf/view?usp=sharing">emailed the committee</a> for COLING 2022, the conference that had accepted the other paper, as well as the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), which runs the conference and publishes its proceedings.His letter <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zhDPUs4eX1aw0GSCR_Ak1QQSKXjxdSNBER2WCw_u0ps/edit?usp=sharing">described the unreferenced use of <em>jury</em></a> and identifies nine instances of suspected plagiarism, including identical segments of code and segments with only slight changes. He received a response in October, two months later, from one of the COLING 2022 committee members, Leo Wanner. Wanner wrote that the group was looking into the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most irritating part, Çavuşoğlu told Retraction Watch, is that the authors had written about <em>jury</em> in the paper, referring to it as one of the other available resources, and had even compared attributes of their own project with <em>jury </em>in a table.<em> </em>“They copied our source code and our system architecture,” he said, but there was no mention that they had built their software on top of <em>jury</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He argues in his letter that the references to <em>jury</em> expose the plagiarism as intentional, since the authors were aware of the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While improvements to code are typical in open-source software, failing to credit the original work still amounts to plagiarism, Çavuşoğlu said. If there had been appropriate attribution – which usually involves adding a license file which credits the original authors to the repository of files – “there would be no problems in terms of software use,” Çavuşoğlu said. “But they didn’t include it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the plagiarizing paper have not replied to requests for comment.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In December 2023 – several months after Çavuşoğlu had first flagged the similarities – the files on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/disi-unibo-nlp/nlg-metricverse/commit/cc303cde997e9ce07c0352961ff6fcccab6ec9d3">were updated to include</a> an acknowledgement to <em>jury</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, Wannerwrote to Çavuşoğlu that “indeed, in the paper you drew our attention to, required references to your work are missing and that this constitutes a case of plagiarism.” He added that the publication chairs for the conference had asked the ACL Anthology, a library of the work published at ACL conferences, to retract the paper “quite a long while ago.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Contacting the ACL authorities was not easy,” Çavuşoğlu said, noting the length of time it took to have the plagiarism verdict. “I clawed my way to what we have now.” Wanner did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PDF of the paper associated with the code is watermarked as retracted, and a note was included <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/commit/2f7071a7e408cdf81192c5e8a03ba3ab7480c4c3">on the GitHub page</a> for the work last week – about eight months after Çavuşoğlu’s first email to the committee.</p>



<p>There is no notice explaining the reason for the retraction. Matt Post, who manages the library of conference papers for ACL, said updates are processed in monthly batches, and this one would be live after the end of May.</p>

<p>A university vice president has received his first retraction – and disagrees with it, according to the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction for <a href="https://profiles.ucla.edu/jaydutt.vadgama">Jaydutt Vadgama</a>, the Vice President for Research and Health Affairs at the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, comes after a <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1">commenter on PubPeer</a> noted similarities between data in two papers from the same group. Similar comments have led to corrections to two other papers by Vadgama, who is also professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles.</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-017-4211-y">A83-01 inhibits TGF-β-induced upregulation of Wnt3 and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells</a>,” appeared in <em>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</em> in 2017. It has been cited 38 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retraction <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-024-07371-1">notice</a>, published this month, states:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129284"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>After publication, concerns were raised regarding image overlap with the authors&#8217; earlier article [1] and highly similar bands in the western blot images presented in the figures. Specifically:</p>



<ul>
<li>Figure 1d Twist, E-Cadherin and β-actin blots appear highly similar to the same proteins in Fig. 3a of [1];</li>



<li>Figure 3d α-Tubulin blot appears highly similar to the same protein in Fig, 4c of [1];</li>



<li>A number of bands in Figs. 1d, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3d, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5d and S2 appear to be duplicated.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, in Fig. 5b, the 4 h images for pSmad3 and pSmad3/DAPI don&#8217;t seem to correspond to the same area, and two nuclei in the pSmad3/DAPI image appear highly similar.</p>



<p>The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#1">April 2023</a>, PubPeer user “Actinopolyspora biskrensis” raised concerns about “possible data reuse between papers, as well as possibly duplicated signals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#2">responded</a>, and posted photos of what they said were the original gels:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Thank you for your interest in our research and being critical of the figures. We wish to reassure the commentator that there is NO data reuse between the two papers identified, even though the loading controls β-actin and α-Tubulin look similar under each blot. The first author is the primary lead investigator who conducted the studies, while the last author is the senior author and PI whose grants have funded this study. All of our data presented in the papers were produced several times by different individuals in the lab. We made sure that the data were reproduced with accuracy and reproducibility.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Actinopolyspora <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/C4353E9C5140872769AB2BF3E56EE1#3">responded once again</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am unable to locate the published bands in these images, with one exception.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors didn’t respond to this comment, also from April 2023. The paper’s retraction came over a year later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vadgama has not responded to our request for comment, nor has first author <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/cancer/members/yanyuan-wu">Yanyuan Wu</a>. Both did “not agree to this retraction,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of Vadgama’s other papers have <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=vadgama">comments on PubPeer</a> questioning the validity of images, which commenters have claimed appear to be repeated, overlaid, or superimposed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some PubPeer comments on Vadgama’s articles have spurred corrections. The journal <em>Cancers </em><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/1/7">issued a correction</a> last April to a paper after first author Pranabananda Dutta said “an <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/132BE5039FDCBCA817485CE574858E">inadvertent error</a>” resulted in the same image being used twice with slightly altered brightness. In another case, after Actinopolyspora biskrensis raised concerns of image splicing, horizontal stretching, and duplication, study author Nalo Hamilton admitted the image was “<a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/6E1F7DB052E59C511B3F21EDDD65A0#10">inadvertently duplicated</a>” and the <em>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</em> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/5/2579">issued a correction</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vadgama and a coauthor admitted mistakes or said they were looking into the issues raised for <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/B175BBC425CDDCF05F123580FE112D#2">two</a> <a href="https://www.pubpeer.com/publications/F26738B524F3162E9E389DEA6C94E4#3">other</a> papers, which have yet to be corrected.</p>

<p>The dean of science at the University of Sydney is reassessing a series of review papers after commenters on PubPeer pointed out each cited several retracted articles, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people.html">Marcel Dinger</a> and his coauthors will submit addendums to the journals noting the retracted references, he told Retraction Watch, and work with editors to determine whether the reviews should be retracted. </p>



<p>Dinger, who also is a professor of genome biology, is a middle author of four review articles and last author on one more that sleuths using the <a href="https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener">Problematic Paper Screener</a> flagged as referencing retracted articles. The articles have been cited nearly 100 times altogether, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guillaume Cabanac, who developed the screener, commented on one of the papers in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B47EC3FFB2E6C1A4BB71778D3857BB#1">August 2022</a>: </p>

<p>Readers should reassess the reliability of this paper as its bibliography includes several questioned references that are likely to be unreliable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Responding to Cabanac, one of the authors, Mohammad Taheri of the Institute of Human Genetics at Jena University Hospital in Germany, who has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Mohammad+Taheri">many more papers flagged on PubPeer</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B47EC3FFB2E6C1A4BB71778D3857BB#2">wrote</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The retracted papers cited by us were retracted one or two years after our publication, not before. When writing a review paper, it is not feasible to evaluate all 200 original papers that you intend to cite.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(Helping scientists with this problem was one of the reasons we created the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx">Retraction Watch Database</a>, now <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/09/12/the-retraction-watch-database-becomes-completely-open-and-rw-becomes-far-more-sustainable/">part of Crossref</a>: Researchers using Zotero, Endnote and other software can automate checking their references for retracted articles.)</p>



<p>Dinger told us he and his coauthors had cited the problematic papermill articles unwittingly, and have begun assessing the damage to their work:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Most of these comments relate to a series of review papers &#8211; they were part of a cataloguing effort of noncoding RNAs in various disease contexts – the underlying work in these literature curation efforts had been intended to inform an update to the long noncoding RNA database (a project I led a number of years ago, but has since fallen out of date – (see <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/10/20/nar.gku988.long">Quek et al</a>, <em>Nucleic Acids Research</em>, 2015).</p>



<p>In an effort to be comprehensive, we erred on the side of inclusivity in terms of the literature cited in each of the specific disease contexts. What we were unaware of at the time was that this coincided with the emergence of the so-called “Chinese papermills”, which ended up contaminating the peer-reviewed literature with 1000s (or even 10,000s or 100,000s) papers that were in essence completely fraudulent. Regrettably, a number of these papers were cited in some of the review articles.</p>



<p>I am in contact with the co-authors of the affected papers at the moment and we are now undertaking a review of the papers to assess the impact of these citations to now-retracted publications (I should note the publications were not retracted at the time the papers were published). We will then put together addendums to the journals to highlight those publications that were cited that are retracted. We will also assess the overall impact to the content/commentary/conclusions in the papers. If the impact is potentially significant, we will work with the respective editors to determine if the entire paper should be retracted also.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The five flagged articles are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/666626C7935DE03E753E96AB010DD1#1">another post</a> on PubPeer questioning the ethics approval of a research paper, “<a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/human-antibodies/hab220004">HLA alleles and haplotype frequencies in Iranian population</a>,” Dinger said his co-authors have the correct approvals for the work. He has asked them to respond on PubPeer “to clear the record on this matter.”</p>

<p>A well-known content creator and former lab technician at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas admitted taking “several shortcuts” in work that has been found to contain falsified data funded by the National Institutes of Health, according to a U.S. government watchdog.</p>



<p>Darrion Nguyen, who has more than a half-million followers on his TikTok account “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lab_shenanigans">lab_shenanigans</a>,” engaged in research misconduct while working at Baylor by “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly falsifying and/or fabricating experimental data and results” of several research records, two manuscript figures, a research progress report, a poster, and a presentation, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-nguyen-darrion">said</a>.</p>



<span id="more-129267"></span>



<p>The ORI’s findings primarily concern the research report, “Illuminating GABAergic Signaling in Neurodevelopmental Disorders,” submitted to the NIH in July 2021. The report contained fabricated data of the number of mice used, their interactions, as well as enhanced mice brain measurements and symptom severity, according to the agency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was in a lab environment where I was mentally struggling, and I took several shortcuts to produce more data. This stemmed from the fear of my [principal investigator], the pressure to meet expectations to keep my job as a technician, and my personal struggles to keep up with the demands of that lab,” Nguyen told <em>Retraction Watch</em>. He said his situation underscores the dangers of the &#8220;publish or perish&#8221; culture prominent in academia.</p>



<p>Nguyen has been posting online videos and TikToks since 2019. While working as a lab technician, he often found himself meshing “late nights into creative sessions,” according to his <a href="https://www.labshenanigans.com/">website</a>. He left Baylor in September 2020 and is now a science communicator who “makes fun, easily digestible science content.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI’s findings concern grants funded for more than $1 million. <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/hsiao-tuan-chao-19229">Hsiao-Tuan Chao</a>, the principal investigator on the grants to Baylor, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nguyen agreed to have his research supervised for three years, and must submit supervision plans and certification of evidence if he is to be involved with any research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the NIH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Upon the launch of this investigation, I immediately stepped forward and maintained complete transparency throughout the process. I take full accountability for my mistakes and recognize the importance of owning up to them,” Nguyen said.</p>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>We’ve all heard of HeLa cells, and the incredible research performed on them, but where did they come from and whose cells were they? Naomi Thorne reviews Rebecca Skloot’s </strong></span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</strong></span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;"><strong>, to shine a light on the ethical disaster that Lacks and her family were victims of.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As scientists, how many of us use cell culture on a daily basis? The use of immortal cell lines is a fundamental methodology in 21st century biology that we would struggle to do research without. Thanks to the development of human cell culture, we are able to understand the mechanics of our cells better than ever before. This has allowed for the creation of vaccines, the progression of therapeutic drugs to clinical trials, and countless biological discoveries. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In the 1950s, the invention of the first immortal human cell line, HeLa, provided a low-cost way to conduct experiments on living human cells for the first time. One of the most significant advantages was that this new approach helped mitigate the need for direct human experimentation in early-stage research, greatly reducing the widespread ethical concerns around this practice. The cells provided a ground-breaking and accessible model, and the scientists who had obtained the cells were celebrated as pioneers. But what about the real person whose cells enabled this breakthrough in preclinical research? Who was she, and why was she so important? </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Her name was Henrietta Lacks, and her story has finally been told in the book “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” - a powerful read that raises questions about the ethics of this scientific discovery.</span></span></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_02c00d398ac04055884e49ad845ad351~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_200,h_288,al_c,q_80/file.png"title="Henrietta Lacks"></figure>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The author, Rebecca Skloot, first learned about Henrietta Lacks when Lacks was mentioned, fleetingly, in a school biology lesson and briefly acknowledged as the origin of the HeLa name: “He” from Henrietta, and “La” from Lacks. But that is all she was – a name. People knew the story of the cells, but what was </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">her </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">story? From that moment on, Rebecca felt compelled to discover more about Henrietta. She found that, contrary to assumption, Henrietta Lacks did not voluntarily donate her cells to science. Unearthing a huge ethical debate, this book follows Skloot on her journey to ascertain how Henrietta’s cells came to be in the hands of scientists, and whether her living family even knew the extent of her contribution to modern science. Over 10 years, the author built a relationship with Henrietta’s family, particularly with her daughter, Deborah, who was also in pursuit of information about her mother. Together, they spoke to the extended Lacks family, as well as friends, doctors and scientists to build a picture of Henrietta’s life. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman, born in 1920 to a family of tobacco farmers in Roanoke, Virginia. She married, had children, and then moved with her husband to Maryland in 1941. Shortly after the birth of her fifth child, she was hospitalised at Johns Hopkins – the only facility in the area that offered care for black patients – for an extremely aggressive form of cervical cancer. Despite several treatment attempts, the cancer was stubborn and Henrietta passed away in August of 1951, aged just 31. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">As her family grieved, they were unaware that scientists had taken some of Henrietta’s malignant cells without permission. They began to culture these cells in the lab and attempted to establish a cell line for experimental use. Without Henrietta’s knowledge or consent, several biopsies had been taken from her cervical tissue, both in life during treatments, and in death during autopsy. Her tissue was passed on to a cancer researcher, and her rapidly dividing cancer cells enabled him to create the, now world-renowned, HeLa cell line. Horrifyingly, her family did not discover this until decades later. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>

Taken by Ellie Pipe for Bristol 24/7"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">What had started as an inquisition for Skloot became a 10-year-long search, first for answers and then for justice, as she learned about the range of ethical concerns relating to Henrietta’s cells. Not only had the cells been taken without consent, but they had subsequently been commercialised – bought and sold across the world, while the Lacks family struggled to afford healthcare. In addition, Skloot found that the family’s medical records had been published without their knowledge, as metadata, to help scientists understand more about the HeLa line and its origin. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Within the book, Skloot also discusses the absence of communication with the Lacks family, and finally gives them the tools to understand the science behind </span></span><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">why </span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Henrietta’s cells are so important and how, and why, they are still alive today. In addition to the discussions surrounding concerns directly relating to Henrietta’s case, the book highlights wider issues experienced by other members of the Lacks family, such as racism and abuse within the healthcare system. At times the accounts are difficult to hear, but are extremely important even today, years later, to understand the hardship experienced by Henrietta and her family over the years and contextualise the cell line’s continued use.</span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<figure><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2192bd_55f67e1abaf744bbae9d63747f61b128~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_193,h_293,al_c,q_80/file.png"></figure>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Overall, the book tells the truly compelling story of Henrietta Lacks, humanising her from a mere name in a science textbook to a real person, with a family looking for justice. Packed with information, it completely rewrote my understanding of how cell culture began. Like many people, I had previously assumed that most cell lines were derived from tissue donations, by voluntary donors after giving informed consent, and that their anonymity and privacy would be ensured. This book questioned these idealistic thoughts and raised topics I had never considered, such as the past and present ethical and legal guidelines surrounding patient tissue donation. Aside from the scientific explanations, it tactfully and empathetically told the story from the Lacks family’s viewpoint, allowing me to understand and appreciate what the family went through and how they are still impacted, to this day, by reverberations from the creation of the HeLa cell line. </span></span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Thanks, in part, to this book, people are finally beginning to acknowledge and recognise the role of Henrietta in the development of cell culture. I would highly recommend reading, or listening, to this book, and I urge anybody that works with cell lines to take the time to hear Henrietta’s story, about the contribution she unknowingly made to the biological technique we use every day.</span></span></p>

<p>Numbers are everywhere in retraction land lately: A record <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8">10,000-plus retractions in 2023</a>. 19 journals <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/academic-studies-research-paper-mills-journals-publishing-f5a3d4bc">shut down at Wiley</a>. Now here’s another.</p>



<p>Readers who have checked the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">Retraction Watch leaderboard</a> lately may have picked up on something notable: One researcher, Joachim Boldt, has now been credited with 210 retractions – making him the first author (to our knowledge) with more than 200 retractions to his name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boldt’s new tally – representing about half of his roughly <a href="https://typeset.io/authors/joachim-boldt-4jt8xm9emj">400 publications</a> – admittedly is an accounting change rather than new problems being identified. Some journals have only now come around to acting on the corrupt articles. In that sense, it reflects both progress and a frustrating lack of concern-slash-urgency on the part of the journals that have taken more than a decade to resolve the case.</p>



<span id="more-129263"></span>



<p>As we and others <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2010/10/28/top-german-anesthesiologists-cardiac-surgery-paper-retracted-over-very-serious-misrepresentations/">have reported</a>, the Boldt saga began about 14 years ago with emails to Steve Shafer, then the editor-in-chief of <em>Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia</em>, pointing out suspicious data in a study the German anesthesiologist had published in the journal in late 2009. (<em>The BMJ</em> has a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/187846?path=/bmj/346/7900/Feature.full.pdf">helpful timeline</a> about the case, including a bright line linking Boldt’s fraudulent research to potential harm to patients.)</p>



<p>Shafer, who is now a member of the board of directors of the Center For Scientific Integrity, our parent non-profit organizaztion, eventually became dissatisfied with Boldt’s responses, and then lack of responses, to his questions about the data, and helped trigger an initial institutional investigation into the researcher’s work. Anesthesiology’s recognition that there were problems in the literature – which came earlier for the field than for the vast majority of others – is likely responsible for the fact that so many anesthesiology researchers are among the authors with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">the most retractions in the world</a>.</p>
