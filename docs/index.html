              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-dart-artemis-space-news-2022">The James Webb Space Telescope wasn’t the only big space news in 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>While the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">stunning images</a> from the James Webb Space Telescope captured space fans’ attention this year, other telescopes and spacecraft were busy on Earth and around the solar system (<em>SN Online: 12/7/22</em>). Here are some of the coolest space highlights that had nothing to do with JWST.</p>



<h4>Back to the moon</h4>



<p>After several aborted attempts, NASA launched the Artemis I mission on November 16. That was a big step toward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">the goal of landing people on the moon</a> as early as 2025 (<em>SN: 12/3/22, p. 14</em>). No human has set foot there since 1972. Artemis I included a new rocket, the Space Launch System, which had previously suffered a series of hydrogen fuel leaks, and the new Orion spacecraft. No astronauts were aboard the test flight, but Orion carried a manikin in the commander’s seat and two manikin torsos to test radiation protection and life-support systems, plus a cargo hold full of small satellites that went off on their own missions. On December 11, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-orion-moon-spacecraft-capsule">the Orion capsule successfully returned to Earth</a>, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Mexico (<em>SN Online: 12/12/22</em>).</p>





<h4>DART shoves an asteroid</h4>



<p>NASA’s DART spacecraft successfully nudged an asteroid into a new orbit this year. On September 26, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test slammed into asteroid Dimorphos, about 11 million kilometers from Earth at the time of impact. In October, NASA announced that the impact <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">shortened Dimorphos’ roughly 12-hour orbit</a> around its sibling asteroid, Didymos, by 32 minutes (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 14</em>). Dimorphos posed no threat to Earth, but the test will help inform future missions to divert any asteroids on a potentially dangerous collision course with our home planet, researchers say.</p>

<h4>Massive Marsquakes</h4>



<p>The InSight Mars lander is going out on a high note. After scientists reported in May that InSight had recorded the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-mars-marsquake">largest known Marsquake</a>, roughly a magnitude 5, news came in October that the lander’s seismometer had also detected the rumblings of the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq7704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two biggest meteorite impacts</a> ever observed on Mars. Those impacts created gaping craters and sent <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq7157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic waves rippling along the top of the planet’s crust</a>.</p>



<p>The details of how those waves and others moved through the Red Planet gave researchers new intel on the structure of Mars’ crust, which is hard to study any other way. The data also suggest that some Marsquakes are caused by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-volcanic-activity-planet-nasa-insight">magma moving beneath the surface</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/22, p. 12</em>). The solar panels that power the lander are now covered in dust after four years on Mars, a death knell for the mission.</p>

<h4>Chemistry of life turns up in meteorites</h4>



<p>All five bases in DNA and RNA have been found in rocks that fell to Earth. Three of the nucleobases, which combine with sugars and phosphates to make up the genetic material of all known life, had previously been found in meteorites. But the last two — cytosine and thymine — were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">reported from space rocks only this year</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/22, p. 7</em>). The find supports the idea that life’s precursors could have come to Earth from space, researchers say.</p>

<h4>Sagittarius A* snapshot</h4>



<p>The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way became the second black hole to get its close-up. After releasing a picture of the behemoth at the heart of galaxy M87 in 2019, astronomers used data from the Event Horizon Telescope, a network of radio telescopes around the world, to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">assemble an image of Sagittarius A*</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/22, p. 6</em>). The image, released in May, shows a faint fuzzy shadow nestled in the glowing ring of the accretion disk. That may not sound impressive on its own, but the result provides new details about the turbulence roiling near our black hole’s edge.</p>

                <p>From spiders that catapult their way to safety to sea sponges that sneeze themselves clean, here are the creature features that most impressed us in 2022.</p>



<h4>Fishing fox</h4>



<p>Pics or it didn’t happen. In the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-fox-fish-food-first-video-spain">first recorded instance of a fox fishing</a>, a team from Spain filmed a red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) catching 10 carp over a couple hours (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 4</em>). This makes foxes only the second type of canid — wolves can do it too — that are known to fish for a feast.</p>

<h4>Skydiving salamander</h4>





<p>Flying squirrels, yes, but a skydiving salamander? This bold amphibian, native to northwestern California, can jump and glide among the tops of towering redwood trees. By extending its front and hind legs like a skydiver, the wandering salamander (<em>Aneides vagrans</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wandering-salamanders-glide-trees">can control and adjust its speed and direction while in the air</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 12</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Scientists put salamanders in a vertical wind tunnel to simulate falling from a tree and filmed the animals. While falling, the wandering salamander (<em>Aneides vagrans</em>) can move horizontally (glide) in the air and slow its descent (parachute). It, like its close relative&nbsp;<em>A. lugubris</em>&nbsp;(shown in the third clip), can also move its limbs to change direction midair.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Crafty cockatoos</h4>



<p>In an interspecies battle for the ages, people in Sydney have had to up their defenses to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cockatoo-open-trash-cans">stop cockatoos from rifling through outdoor trash bins</a> (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 10</em>). The birds have learned to push bricks off the bin covers using brute force, while sneakers jammed through a bin’s handles are a better deterrent. But these trash thieves may eventually find a way around that blockade too.</p>

<h4>Spring-to-safety spiders</h4>





<p><em>Philoponella prominens</em> males perform a death-defying stunt to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orb-spiders-mating-male-catapult-female-sex-cannibalism">keep from being eaten by a mate after sex</a>. The orb weaver uses hydraulic pressure within its leg joints to launch nearly 90 centimeters per s­econd to safety (<em>SN Online: 4/25/22</em>).</p>

<h4>Joyriding goldfish</h4>



<p>Teach a fish to drive a motorized fish tank and it will drive wherever it wants. Goldfish taught to drive <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/goldfish-car-drive-navigation-biology">showed they could navigate outside their natural environment</a> and reach a target (<em>SN: 2/12/22, p. 4</em>). Maybe one day these cruising fish will boldly go where no fish has gone before.</p>

<h4>Snotty, sneezy sea sponges</h4>



<p>These creatures take self-care to the next level. Sponges are filter feeders, sucking up water through their pores to get nutrients. But when unwanted junk comes in, an <em>Aplysina archeri</em> tube sponge traps the particles in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-sponge-snot-rocket-mucus-pore">mucus, then expels it in one slow-motion sneeze</a> (<em>SN: 9/10/22, p. 4</em>). The Caribbean sponges are constantly oozing mucus like a child with a runny nose. Looks like someone could use a tissue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Caribbean tube sponge (<em>Aplysina archeri</em>) uses contractions — called “sneezes” — to help eject mucus from its pores, or ostia. As the time-lapse video zooms in closer, it’s possible to see tiny specks of debris floating out of these pores and traveling along a “mucus highway” where they collect into stringy clumps of goo floating above the surface of the sponge. In real time, this sponge takes between 20 and 50 minutes to complete a sneeze.</figcaption></figure>

                The authors of a 2021 paper on a method of male enhancement have been forced to retract the paper after losing a legal battle over the technology.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tuskegee-syphilis-study-medical-racism">Medical racism didn’t begin or end with the syphilis study at Tuskegee</a></h4>

              
                <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>“We were all hard-working men … and citizens of the United States.”</em></p>
<cite>Herman Shaw, 1997</cite></blockquote>



<p>Born in Alabama in 1902, Herman Shaw was a farmer and a cotton mill worker. He and his wife, Fannie Mae, were married for 62 years and had two children and six grandchildren.</p>



<p>Shaw was also a survivor of a 40-year medical experiment.</p>



<p>From 1932 until the Associated Press broke the story in 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service conducted a study of more than 600 Black men in Macon County, Ala., without their informed consent. The men were told they were being tested and receiving free therapies for “bad blood,” a local term for several ailments. Instead, it was a study of untreated syphilis. Roughly two-thirds of the men had the transmissible disease. The Public Health Service did not disclose to the men their diagnoses and withheld available treatments.</p>





<p>The experiment tracked the damage the disease inflicted on the men. The endpoint was death.</p>



<p>In the 50 years since its end, the U.S. Public Health Service Study of Untreated Syphilis at Tuskegee in Alabama has often been held up as a primary driver of distrust of the U.S. health care system in Black communities. Yet medical abuse of Black people has occurred throughout U.S. history.</p>



<p>White people have long justified abuse and mistreatment of Black people by describing them, explicitly and implicitly, as inferior. There have been “four hundred years of active decisions to dehumanize Black people and Black bodies,” says Rachel Hardeman, a reproductive health equity researcher at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis.</p>



<p>As John Heller, chief of the Division of Venereal Diseases at the U.S. Public Health Service from 1943 to 1948, did. Heller said in an interview with historian James Jones for his book on the syphilis study, “Bad Blood,” that “the men’s status did not warrant ethical debate. They were subjects, not patients; clinical material, not sick people.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half a century later, this racist experiment can look like a product of a long-gone era, even as it gets outsize credit for distrust today. In reality, the racism that fueled the syphilis study has existed for centuries and still permeates the U.S. health care system, causing racial disparities in access to medical care and measures of health. While there are a variety of efforts to address these disparities, including medical training to bring awareness of racial biases, there is far to go.</p>





<p>“It is never too late to work to restore faith and trust,” Herman Shaw said in 1997 when the United States apologized for the study. &nbsp;U.S. President Joe Biden echoed these words during a November 30 event acknowledging the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/tuskegee-remembrance/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;50th anniversary of the end of the study</a>: “Restoring faith and trust is the work of our time.”</p>



<h4>Experimentation during slavery</h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>“A slave is not a human being in the eye of the law, and the slaveholder looks upon him just as what the law makes him; nothing more, and perhaps even something less.” </em></p>
<cite><em> </em>John Brown, 1855</cite></blockquote>



<p>In his 1855 memoir, John Brown wrote about his enslavement in Georgia and his escape to England. He described being experimented on to <a href="https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/jbrown/jbrown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test therapies for heat stroke</a>. Brown was forced to sit in a fire-heated pit with only his head exposed.</p>



<p>“In about half an hour I fainted. I was then lifted out and revived, the doctor taking a note of the degree of heat when I left the pit,” Brown wrote. The experiments continued as the doctor investigated which medicine “enabled me to withstand the greatest degree of heat.”</p>



<p>The enslavement and abuse of Black Americans were sanctioned by prevailing medical theories. Antebellum doctors claimed that Black people “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0749-3797(18)30664-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possessed peculiar physiological and anatomical features that justified their enslavement</a>,” Vanessa Northington Gamble wrote in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em> in 1993. “This medical distinctiveness, [the physicians] argued, made Africans not only inferior but inherently suited for slavery.” And for medical experimentation.</p>



<p>That included excruciatingly painful gynecological surgeries performed on enslaved Black women by white doctors, experiments that advanced the field. Thought of as biologically inferior to white women, while also deemed to have a high tolerance for pain, enslaved women were <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pwt69x.1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered “perfect medical subjects” </a>for experimentation, Deirdre Cooper Owens, a historian at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, wrote in her 2017 book <em>Medical Bondage: Race, Gender, and the Origins of American Gynecology</em>.</p>

Marion Sims, who became known as the “Father of Gynecology.”</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120383">Steven Zucker/Flickr (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Anarcha, Betsy and Lucy were among about a dozen enslaved women who surgeon J. Marion Sims experimented on. He performed surgeries on the women, without anesthesia, to develop a repair for an abnormal opening between the bladder and the vagina. Held on Sims’ property from 1844 to 1849, the women were trained by Sims to assist with the procedure and became his surgical nurses, Cooper Owens wrote.</p>



<p>The work brought Sims renown as a gynecological surgeon. But, she wrote, “the central role that enslaved women played in these advances — by providing doctors the bodies and sometimes labor needed for experimentation, treatment, and repair — went unacknowledged.”</p>



<h4>Embedded racism</h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>“The Alabama community offered an unparalleled opportunity for the study of the effect of untreated syphilis.” </em></p>
<cite>Taliaferro Clark, Public Health Service, 1932</cite></blockquote>



<p>In the early 20th century, white physicians attributed the high rates of syphilis among Black people to their supposed immorality and excessive sexual desire. White doctors alleged that the disease was difficult to treat in Black people, because they wouldn’t <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0749-3797(18)30664-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliably seek out or follow a therapeutic regimen</a>, Northington Gamble wrote in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Another prevailing theory that motivated the experiment was “the belief that syphilis was a different disease in African Americans than it was in white people,” says Northington Gamble, a medical historian and physician at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. “This whole theory of Black bodies being fundamentally different was a foundation not only of the syphilis study, but also the foundation of medical practice.”</p>



<p>The idea persists today. Race is <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/new-ama-policies-recognize-race-social-not-biological-construct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a social concept</a>, but using race as though it designates biological differences informs <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms2004740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment decisions about the kidneys, the lungs, pregnancy and more</a>.</p>



<p>For example, an equation that estimates kidney function long included a race-based adjustment, despite a lack of evidence for its use. The adjustment could mask the kidneys’ true condition in Black people.</p>



<p>Without the adjustment, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00478-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.3 million more Black Americans met a threshold for stage 3 chronic kidney disease</a>, researchers reported in <em>eClinicalMedicine</em> in 2021. At this stage, complications from kidney disease start to occur, meaning Black Americans could be missing out on needed care, the researchers wrote. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2798758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new equation to estimate kidney function</a> without a race adjustment is starting to be used in clinical practice.</p>



<p>In contrast, the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1516047113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">belief that Black people experience less pain than white people</a> hasn’t been extinguished. Today, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMpv2024759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black people often report their pain is not taken seriously</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/22/1/75/6046167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence shows their pain is undertreated</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Racism has been baked into health care,” Hardeman says. It’s <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1609535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embedded in the system</a>: in therapeutic protocols, in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-022-07562-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distribution of health care resources</a>, in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racial-bias-race-us-patient-medical-notes-chart-records">how a physician treats a patient</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/22</em>).</p>



<p>Black people are nearly twice as likely as white people to have <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/birt.12641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">procedures during perinatal care and birth done without their consent</a>, researchers reported in <em>Birth </em>in June. Hardeman has talked to Black people whose doctors sent their urine samples for toxicological screens in prenatal visits without their consent. “There’s this underlying assumption that there is likely drug use and that a tox screen is necessary,” she says.</p>

<p>The maternal mortality rate for Black women is about three times the rate for white women and for Hispanic women, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest data, from 2020, reports 55 deaths per 100,000 live births for Black women, compared with 19 per 100,000 for white women and 18 per 100,000 for Hispanic women.</p>

<p>This embedded, structural racism is <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2789583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a risk to health</a>, and underlies health disparities at birth and throughout life in the United States. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-newborn-baby-survival-doctor-race-mortality-rate-disparity">Black newborns are more likely to die</a> than white newborns (<em>SN: 8/25/20</em>). The rate of <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jwh.2020.8882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal mortality for Black women</a> is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly three times</a> that of white women.

<p>Singling out the syphilis study when discussing African Americans’ attitudes towards the medical system is “overly simplistic and historically inaccurate,” Northington Gamble says. The view that “the medical profession did not always have the best interest of African Americans at heart predated the syphilis study.” And the burden shouldn’t be on African Americans to change their attitudes, she says. “Trust should be earned.”</p>



<p>Along with past examples, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMpv2035827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern-day instances of medical racism that contribute to distrust</a>, says Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “Every single day it’s still going on,” she says.</p>



<h4>Beyond the syphilis study</h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>“What the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.”  </em></p>
<cite>President Bill Clinton, 1997</cite></blockquote>



<p>Twenty-five years after the end of the syphilis study, the U.S. government apologized. Northington Gamble was part of the <a href="https://www.tuskegee.edu/about-us/centers-of-excellence/bioethics-center/syphilis-study-legacy-committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committee that helped to make the apology happen</a>. She spoke about the event during the November 30 remembrance of the syphilis study, hosted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>



<p>“When President Clinton said, ‘and I am sorry,’ … there were sobs around the room,” Northington Gamble said. “And it wasn’t sobs just about the syphilis study, but it was sobs about how Black people have been treated in this country.”</p>

<p>Addressing and dismantling the racism behind that unequal treatment “will require <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changing systems, laws, policies and practices</a>,” researchers wrote in <em>Health Affairs</em> in February. Those changes should include mandating standards for health care systems to achieve equitable results for patients, and medical <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp2021072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">training in the health effects of structural racism</a>, knowledge that would be required for professional licensing, Hardeman and colleagues wrote in 2020.</p>



<p>Some medical schools are bolstering their curriculum with <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/medical-schools-overhaul-curricula-fight-inequities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more extensive instruction on racism and health inequities</a>.</p>



<p>Doriane Miller, a primary care physician at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and director of the institution’s Center for Community Health and Vitality, leads doctors in training on tours of the surrounding area, in the south side of Chicago. People often see the area as defined by poverty and violence, Miller says. The tour offers a different story.</p>



<p>Miller talks about “how people came to this city looking for opportunities from the Deep South, in order to escape racism and segregation, and formed thriving businesses and communities.” She takes the new doctors by Provident Hospital, founded by the <a href="https://provfound.org/index.php/history/history-dr-daniel-hale-williams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black surgeon Daniel Hale Williams</a> in 1891. The first Black-owned and -operated hospital in the nation, it also provided training for Black doctors and nurses. Williams performed the first successful open-heart surgery in the United States in 1893 and helped establish the National Medical Association, the first national organization of medical professionals open to African Americans.</p>



<p>The historical tour is a way to give new doctors “a sense of, not just physical place, but the people they will be serving,” Miller says. People “want to have you understand their circumstances, so that you can respond to them as individuals,” she says, “rather than making presumptions about who they are and where they come from.”</p>



<p>Like the presumptions many made about the men included in the syphilis study. “What happens is that the humanity and the individuality and the life experiences and history of the men themselves, and their families, are erased,” Northington Gamble says. “People forget the fact that these were men with lives and families and stories.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-small-far-planets-space">The James Webb telescope is getting glimpses of small, far-off planets</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>BALTIMORE</strong> — When the James Webb Space Telescope was first dreamed up, exoplanets hadn’t even been discovered yet. Now the observatory is showing astronomers what it can learn about planets orbiting other stars — including the small ones.</p>



<p>Since its launch in December 2021, JWST had already <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-carbon-dioxide-exoplanet-atmosphere">“sniffed” the atmospheres</a> of Jupiter-sized planets orbiting searingly close to their stars (<em>SN: 8/26/22</em>). Those intense worlds are interesting, but not the places where astronomers hope to look for signs of life. The telescope is now getting glimpses of atmospheres on known exoplanets of the more terrestrial persuasion, astronomers reported December 13 and 14 at the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/events/stsci/2022/december/first-science-results-from-jwst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Science Results from JWST</a> conference.</p>





<p>And JWST is starting to find new rocky worlds too.</p>



<p>These early peeks at far-off worlds don’t yet reveal a lot about these remote locales. But researchers are buoyed by what JWST’s sharp vision in infrared wavelengths could eventually unearth about the smaller planets beyond our solar system.</p>



<p>“The main message is, we’re in business,” said University of Montreal astronomer Björn Benneke. “We don’t even have all the observations yet, but they are already quite exciting.”</p>



<p>One of the smaller planets that JWST looked at is GJ 1214b, which has frustrated astronomers since its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/super-earth-found-close-may-host-water">discovery in 2009</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/09</em>). The planet is a sub-Neptune, meaning its size is somewhere between that of a rocky world like Earth and a gaseous one like Neptune.</p>



<p>“What the heck are sub-Neptunes?” asked astronomer Eliza Kempton of the University of Maryland in College Park. They could be balls of rock with thick hydrogen and helium atmospheres, or maybe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planet-exotic-water-world">water worlds</a> (<em>SN: 2/22/12</em>). “What we’d like to do with atmospheric characterization is measure their atmospheres and see which is which,” Kempton said.</p>



<p>Previously, astronomers tried to observe the makeup of GJ 1214b’s atmosphere by watching how starlight filtered through it. But the atmosphere is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/signs-cloudy-skies-seen-two-exoplanet-atmospheres">thick and hazy</a>, blocking astronomers’ ability to detect individual molecules in it.</p>



<p>Instead of watching the planet pass in front of its star, Kempton and colleagues used JWST to look for the glow of the planet right before it disappeared <em>behind</em> the star. And it worked: After 38 hours of observing, the researchers detected the planet’s infrared glow, Kempton said in a December 13 presentation.</p>





<p>There’s more work to do, but the initial data suggest the planet has a lot of chemical components, possibly including water and methane. It’s also enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.</p>



<p>As for knowing what kind of world GJ 1214b is, “I’d say we’re not quite there yet,” Kempton said. It could be a watery planet, she said, or a gassy planet that has lost a fair amount of its lighter elements.</p>



<p>The telescope also had its first look at the tantalizing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trappist-1-earth-sized-planets-top-science-stories-2017-yir">TRAPPIST-1 system</a>, Benneke said in a different December 13 presentation (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>). Discovered in 2017, the system contains seven Earth-sized worlds that are probably rocky. Three of those planets might have the right temperatures for liquid water to exist on their surface, making them particularly interesting targets for JWST and other telescopes to look for signs of life.</p>



<p>But TRAPPIST-1 is a small, red star called an M dwarf, a type of star that is notorious for violent flares and strong radiation. For years, astronomers have debated whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-might-have-shot-planets-orbiting-dim-red-stars">planets around these stars would be hospitable to life</a>, or if the stars would strip their planets’ atmospheres away (<em>SN: 6/14/17</em>).</p>



<p>“If the TRAPPIST planets don’t have atmospheres, then we need to move on” from M dwarfs in the search for extraterrestrial life, says astronomer Mercedes Lόpez-Morales of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., who was not involved in the new JWST observations.</p>



<p>JWST’s first look at one of those potentially habitable worlds, TRAPPIST-1g, did not reveal any clear signs of an atmosphere. But the telescope looked at the planet for only about five hours. With more observations, an atmosphere should be detectable if it’s there, Benneke said.</p>



<p>JWST is getting into the planet-hunting game too, said astronomer Kevin Stevenson on December 14. The telescope double-checked a potentially interesting observation from another telescope and confirmed that it had seen a rocky, Earth-sized world around a nearby M dwarf. This proves that JWST has the precision to find such worlds.</p>



<p><a></a>“It is an exciting result, perhaps the first discovery of an exoplanet by JWST,” said Stevenson, of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. The planet orbits its dim star every two days, so it’s probably around 225° Celsius on the surface — likely too hot to be habitable, he says. “It’s more like an exo-Venus than an exo-Earth.”</p>



<p>While it’s still early days, the researchers emphasized, the forecast for planet hunting using JWST is good.</p>



<p>The results are paving the way for future observatories too, said astrophysicist John Mather of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Astronomers’ <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/ocga/testimony-before-congress/a-review-of-the-decadal-survey-for-astronomy-and-astrophysics-in-the-2020s-kennicut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wish list for future missions</a> includes a telescope that can dig even further into the details of potentially habitable worlds.</p>



<p>“If it’s not impossible,” Mather said, “let’s do it.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/image-1-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques hold a great potential in solving complex world problems. They can facilitate clinical decision making by providing actionable insights through ‘learning’ from large volumes of patient data. Among others, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31645-3">deep learning algorithms were proved able to accurately identify head CT scan abnormalities</a> requiring urgent attention, significantly increasing the efficiency of health services</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Encouraged by such exciting developments, AI is increasingly expected to be a promising means to realise high-performing medicine in the near future and is widely hoped to be the rescue for the overstretched health systems across the world in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this promise comes with critical and alarming caveats for clinical decision making: there is a consensus that AI models, particularly those using data-driven technologies, are subject to, or themselves cause, bias and discrimination, exacerbating existing health inequalities. </span></p>
<p><b>Health inequities </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recent studies show that without proper mitigation on potential bias against underrepresented groups such as women and ethnic minorities, implementation of AI in healthcare can result in life or death consequences. A <a href="https://informatics.bmj.com/content/29/1/e100457.full">study by Straw and Wu</a> showed that AI models built to identify people at high risk of liver disease from blood tests are twice as likely to miss the disease in women as in men</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is because data-driven AI models make inferences by finding ‘patterns’ from the data they analyse, but disparities such as those on racial and ethnic basis <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25032386/">have long existed in health and care</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Without effective mitigation approaches, </span>inferences learnt from such biased data are inevitably channeling embedded inequities into the decisions they make.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from data-embedded structural health inequities, under-representation of minorities in health datasets creates a real technical challenge for machine learning to come up with sensible conclusions for such groups, creating another potential source of inequities exacerbated by AI. </span>An insufficient number of samples of a minority group will cause computational models to draw inaccurate predictions for them<span style="font-weight: 400">. Unfortunately, such situations are pervasive for ethnic minority groups in healthcare datasets, which might not</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> always reflect the actual population diversity:</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> machine learning models trained on such data would draw inaccurate conclusions regarding the incidence or the risk of a disease within a specific population subset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to those embedded in data, biases could also arise from methodological choices for AI development and deployment. Obermeyer and colleagues</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342">analysed an algorithm widely employed in the US</a> that uses health costs as a proxy for health needs and they demonstrated that it falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Technically speaking,</span> bias might be unintentionally and easily induced in the feature selections (the choice of the input variables) and label determinations (the choice of target variables) of AI model developments.</p>

<p><b>Patient care</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides potential bias and inequalities, already well-established as ethical concerns associated with the use of AI in health care, there are also numerous other challenges that may have significant impact on patient care. AI has the potential to impact not only diagnosis but also prevention, treatment, and disease management on systems-scale, thus raising broader questions about its role in public health, for example in anticipating epidemics and providing patient support. AI is data-driven and health care data are often difficult (or even impossible) to anonymise, raising worries about privacy and data protection for patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Questions of legal accountability and moral responsibility in AI-driven decision-making have been raised, drawing attention to the potential changes in doctor-patient relationships. A <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-022-00842-4">study by Hallowell et al.</a> recently published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em> explores under what conditions trust could be placed in AI medical tools, highlighting that relational and epistemic trust is crucial, as clinician’s positive experience is directly correlated to future patient’s trust in AI tools. This study emphasises the need for deliberate and meticulous steps in designing trustworthy, confidence-worthy AI processes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Increasingly data-heavy medical practice might require novel skills from the next generation of medical professionals with consequences for the future of medical education. In order to address these issues, implementation of critical frameworks such as <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-022-00746-3">embedded ethics in the development of medical AI</a> is required.</span></p>
<p><b>The need for tools to mitigate or overcome ethical issues</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All in all, the use of AI in medicine, although it may bear high reward, is currently associated with high risk, as its consequences and implications are high-stakes including widening the social gap in health services and further fragmenting an already-divided society. Some tools are already available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05577">for general bias audit</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> or particularly <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/721">designed for healthcare application</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and focused research communities are emerging, such as the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/health-equity">Health Equity group</a> at the Alan Turing Institute </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and the independent community of <a href="https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/">Data Science for Health Equity</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Metrics such as fairness, accountability, methods for bias mitigation, and explainability or interpretability are major aspects that impact the perception and use of AI in ethically-sensitive fields such as medicine, and methods endowed with these features might play a significant role in overcoming mistrust, although they could not guarantee trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we still do not have a clear picture about data-embedded and AI-induced bias in healthcare and their implications in our society: the biases of AI models are not quantified and reported with the same enthusiastic attention as accuracies, let alone apply effective mitigation approaches before deployments. Similarly, studies about the impact the use of AI has in healthcare, from multiple practical and theoretical perspectives, are still relatively limited compared to the impressive expansion of this field: more discussion is needed for a fair and critical consideration of these new technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For these reasons, a cross-journal collection, <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/eaihm"><em>Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Health and Medicine</em></a>, has been launched in collaboration with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Medical Ethics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The collection welcomes studies focused on technical assessment and evaluation of AI-based medical decision making methods with regards to these ethics-relevant features, as well as more theoretical considerations on the medical use of AI-based methods. This includes but is not limited to the presentation of novel AI-based methods able to fulfil such ethical requirements and tools able to mitigate issues like bias, the elaboration of novel ethics-relevant metrics, research on attitudes and perceptions of physicians and the public on AI implementation, ethics surrounding AI-associated privacy and surveillance, and ethical challenges surrounding implementation of medical AI.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-ichthyosaur-graveyard-breeding-ground">Mysterious ichthyosaur graveyard may have been a breeding ground</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some 230 million years ago, massive dolphinlike reptiles called ichthyosaurs gathered to breed in safe waters — just like many modern whales do. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the conclusion that researchers arrived at after studying a mysterious ichthyosaur graveyard in Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park in Nevada. The park is home to the world’s richest assemblage of fossils of <em>Shonisaurus popularis</em>, one of the largest <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-dragons">ichthyosaurs</a> ever discovered (<em>SN: 8/19/02</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is something we see in modern marine vertebrates — gray whales make [the] trek to Baja California every year” to breed, says Randall Irmis, a paleontologist at the National History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City. The sheltered, warm water offers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-aaas-3">safety for the whales</a> (<em>SN: 1/19/80</em>).</p>





<p>The <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01761-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982222017614%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new finding</a>, described December 19 in <em>Current Biology</em>, shows that this behavior “goes back at least 230 million years,” Irmis says. “It really connects the past to the present in a big way.”</p>



<p>The idea of birthing areas for ichthyosaurs has been proposed previously, and is even well-known enough to often be incorporated into artists’ renderings of the creatures, says Erin Maxwell, a paleontologist at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany, who wasn’t involved in the new research. But, she says, this study “is the first to support these speculations with data.”</p>



<p>Nevada’s ichthyosaur fossil trove has been a puzzle to paleontologists for decades. One curiosity is the many ichthyosaur fossils clustered in what’s now the park, but about 230 million years ago, was part of a tropical sea. Another oddity is that the site seems as if it were almost entirely populated by giant, 14-meter-long adult <em>S.</em> <em>popularis</em>. And then there’s the tantalizing question of what caused the deaths.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously suggested that the reptiles, which could be roughly the length of a school bus when grown, had congregated together for some unknown reason before something caused their mortality en masse.</p>



<p>Several pockets, or quarries, of specimens are scattered across the park. All told, Irmis and colleagues identified at least 112 ichthyosaur individuals in these quarries, including at one site where park officials had left previously discovered bones half-encased in the rock for public viewing.</p>



<p>That death snapshot meant that scientists could examine how the fossils were arranged relative to one another, perhaps offering insight into the reptiles’ behavior, says Neil Kelley, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.</p>



<p>Kelley, Irmis and colleagues used digital cameras and a laser scanner to collect hundreds of measurements of the bone bed with the half-buried reptiles, combining the data into a 3-D model of the site. The team also studied the sizes and shapes of bones from across the park, including some now in museum collections. And the researchers analyzed the chemical makeup of the surrounding rocks and pored over older photographs and field notes.</p>

<p>These scraps of evidence helped the researchers begin to understand what they were looking at — and potentially solve at least one long-standing mystery: what brought these creatures together.</p>



<p>Though almost all of the park&#8217;s <em>Shonisaurus</em> skeletons are fully-grown adults, the site does have a few very tiny ichthyosaur remains, the scientists found. Using micro-computed tomography, a 3-D imaging technique that uses X-rays to see inside the fossils, the researchers discovered that some tiny bones were those of embryonic and newborn <em>Shonisaurus</em>.</p>





<p>The finding led the team to conclude that the site was a birthing ground. That could explain why there were so many of the same creatures in the same place alongside newborns, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The site also seems to have been a birthing ground for <em>Shonisaurus</em> for a long time. Rather than all the quarries dating to roughly the same time, different ones are separated by at least hundreds of thousands of years, the researchers found.</p>



<p>As for what killed the reptiles, “we don’t know,” Irmis says.</p>



<p>Among the hypotheses for a mass mortality event were harmful algal blooms or large-scale volcanic activity. But the new rock chemistry data eliminated those events as culprits.</p>



<p>Some of the animals in each quarry could have still died en masse. Having the creatures grouped in one place to breed may have left the reptiles vulnerable to a sudden catastrophic event that buried them in sediment, such as an undersea landslide.</p>



<p>But the fossil finds might also represent “just normal mortality over time,” Irmis says, given how the creatures seem to have come to the site again and again.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-long-genital-spines-male-defense-survival">Long genital spines on male wasps can save their lives</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fending off an attacker by swordplay with two genital spines turns out to be a moderately useful form of self-defense for male wasps, an unusual study shows. A mason wasp’s rear spikes may be useless when it comes to delivering sperm, but they could save his life.</p>



<p>Male wasps (and bees) don’t grow venom-injecting stingers. That’s female weaponry that evolved with the equipment for laying eggs. Instead, males of a mason wasp species fight against gulping tree frogs (and collecting entomologists) by deploying a pair of spines that evolved with male reproductive genital equipment at the wasp’s rear.</p>





<p>The spines are just pseudo-stings. There’s no venom, but a male wasp can stab an attacking frog in the face and mouth.</p>



<p>“Our study is the&nbsp;first to demonstrate the defensive roles of pseudo-stings as counterattack&nbsp;devices in wasps,” says ecologist Shinji Sugiura of Kobe University in Japan. Biologists have long known the spines exist, but the new study, published December 19 in <em>Current Biology</em>, tests how well they work.</p>



<p>The inspiration came from Sugiura’s student and coauthor, Misaki Tsujii, who got jabbed while collecting a male <em>Anterhynchium gibbifrons </em>mason wasp.</p>



<p>Female mason wasps use their real stinging equipment to paralyze multiple caterpillars as still-alive and fresh baby food. A mom seals zombified caterpillars into the private nursery chamber she builds for each offspring.</p>



<p>Males, without true stinging power, can still deliver “a pricking pain,” says Sugiura. &nbsp;To see just how much protection that pricking offered, the researchers put the wasps near various hungry frogs in the lab.</p>



<p>Each of 17 male wasps trapped with a pond frog (<em>Pelophylax nigromaculatus</em>) got eaten despite the pricking. Confrontations with the tree frog <em>Dryophytes japonica</em>, however, were a different story.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Male <em>Anterhynchium gibbifrons</em> mason wasps don’t have stingers, but they do have genital spikes on their rears. So when a tree frog gulps the male, lunch doesn’t always go well. &nbsp;Here, the wasp stabs its spines into the frog’s face and mouth — prompting the frog to vigorously spit out the wasp.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>Male wasps resisted, and this time with some success. Their genital spines “were frequently observed to pierce the frog mouth,” the researchers report. Lab video shows a tree frog batting its skinny-toed feet against a wasp it was vigorously spitting out of its wide frog mouth. Frogs ultimately rejected six of 17 wasps. &nbsp;When offered wasps with the spines removed, however, the tree frogs ate them all.</p>





<p>Judging by Tsujii’s own reaction to being pseudo-stung by one of these male wasps, they don’t sound like pleasant snacks. She ranks the pain as a 1 on the 0–4 Schmidt pain scale <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-books-deliver-double-dose-venomous-animal-facts">used to categorize sting agony</a> increasing from none to, non-technically, chained in hot lava (<em>SN: 7/24/16</em>). A honeybee delivers a 2 of stinging pain.</p>



<p>“I can attest from personal experience that male pseudo-stings … are used in defense,” says James Carpenter, a wasp specialist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “I’ve been jabbed by them several&nbsp;times, and they can be painful enough that they elicit a startle response and you drop the wasp.”</p>



<p>Despite the rear position, though, “the spines don&#8217;t appear to be used in copulation,” Carpenter says. On such occasions, “they&#8217;re moved out of the way.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121522_sm_wasp-rear-spikes_inline.jpg" alt="photo of the rear of a Anterhynchium gibbifrons wasp with a red arrow pointing to the sperm delivery system and a two blue arrows pointing to two spines next to it" class="wp-image-3120402" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121522_sm_wasp-rear-spikes_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121522_sm_wasp-rear-spikes_inline-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120402">Slim little spines (blue arrows) on the rear of this <em>Anterhynchium gibbifrons </em>wasp, one on either side of his sperm-delivery organ (red arrow), don’t have the defensive power of the female stinger. But a new test pitting the wasps against tree frogs finds spines are better than nothing.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120402">Shinji Sugiura</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Sugiura and Tsujii even checked to see if a male that a female had rejected in courtship would use his spines in some way to overcome her objection. No, the researchers say after watching 10 matings and seven rejections: The spines in this species appear merely defensive.</p>



<p>The male spikes, called parameral spines, show up in other kinds of wasps too but have not been tested in those species for defensive power. And the possibility that the spines still have some sexual function should be considered, says Menno Schilthuizen, an evolutionary ecologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center and Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>“The male genitalia of many insects have such accessory spines, whip or drumstick-like structures,” he says.&nbsp; Remaining “outside of the female&#8217;s body during copulation … does not mean that they do not play a role in reproduction. In many species they tap or stroke the female&#8217;s abdomen in what&#8217;s known as ‘copulatory courtship,’ enhancing the male&#8217;s chances that the female will actually use his sperm for fertilizing her eggs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Few studies, even in nonwasps, have documented genital action for self-defense. The other example Sugiura and Tsujii cite comes from hawkmoths. These big, night-flying foragers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hawkmoths-squeak-their-genitals-threatening-bats">use a genital structure to create scratchy static</a> that jams the echolocation frequencies of moth-hunting bats (<em>SN: 7/3/13</em>).</p>



<p>Studying genital structures in terms of defense instead of just sexual allure is important, the researchers argue, in large part because it’s not common. Looking for death-dodging aspects of genital evolution could encourage “a new perspective,” the researchers propose. And there’s astonishing variety to account for in the evolution of genital forms. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-planet-exoplanet-dying-kepler-space-telescope">The first planet found by the Kepler space telescope is doomed</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first planet ever spotted by the Kepler space telescope is falling into its star.</p>



<p>Kepler launched in 2009 on a mission to find exoplanets by watching them cross in front of their stars. The first potential planet the telescope spotted was initially dismissed as a false alarm, but in 2019 astronomer Ashley Chontos and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-planet-kepler-finally-confirmed-10-years-later">proved it was real</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/19</em>). The planet was officially named Kepler 1658b.</p>



<p><a></a>Now, Chontos and others have determined Kepler 1658b’s fate. “It is tragically spiraling into its host star,” says Chontos, now at Princeton University. The planet has roughly 2.5 million years left before it faces a fiery death. “It will ultimately end up being engulfed. Death by star.”</p>





<p>The roughly Jupiter-sized planet is searingly hot, orbiting its star once every three days. In follow-up observations from 2019 to 2022, the planet kept transiting the star earlier than expected.</p>



<p>Combined data from Kepler and other telescopes show that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aca47e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the planet is inching closer to the star</a>, Chontos and colleagues report December 19 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“You can see the interval between the transits is shrinking, really slowly but really consistently, at a rate of 131 milliseconds per year,” says astrophysicist Shreyas Vissapragada of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>



<p>That doesn’t sound like much. But if this trend continues, the planet has only 2 million or 3 million years left to live. “For something that’s been around for 2 to 3 <em>billion</em> years, that’s pretty short,” Vissapragada says. If the planet’s lifetime was a more human 100 years, it would have a little more than a month left.</p>



<p>Studying Kepler 1658b as it dies will help explain the life cycles of similar planets. “Learning something about the actual physics of how orbits shrink over time, we can get a better handle on the fates of all of these planets,” Vissapragada says.</p>

                <p>These reported discoveries from 2022 could be game changers, if only we were sure of the findings. News reports this year left us wondering …</p>



<h4>Is new physics around the corner?</h4>



<p>A measurement of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-particle-mass-standard-model-physics">the mass of an elementary particle called the W boson</a> has physicists holding their breath. Data from the Collider Detector at Fermilab, or CDF, suggest the particle is heftier than expected (<em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 12</em>). If so, the finding would be just the kind of crack that researchers have been looking for in the standard model of particle physics. That theory successfully describes the basic constituents of our world but doesn’t explain how gravity fits in. Whether the discovery dissolves with further measurements or points the way to a new and better understanding of matter remains to be seen.</p>

<h4>Was Old MacDonald a gopher?</h4>



<p>Root-munching southeastern pocket gophers (<em>Geomys pinetis</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pocket-gophers-farm-soil-roots-fertilize">tend their tunnels like farmers tend their fields</a>, scientists claimed (<em>SN Online: 7/14/22</em>). The gophers, which live in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, spread their feces in the tunnels, churn the soil and nibble existing roots. All of that encourages new roots to grow, and so secures future lunch. But some researchers say the gophers’ inadvertent environmental changes don’t count as agriculture. For now, it’s an open question whether any mammals but people cultivate crops.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="382" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_big-if_gopher.jpg" alt="A photo of a southeastern pocket gopher emerging from a hole" class="wp-image-3120315" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_big-if_gopher.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_big-if_gopher-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120315">A controversial claim suggests that southeastern pocket gophers “farm” roots as they dig their dig tunnels.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120315">Veronica Selden/Eurekalert CC BY-SA 2.0</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>Do limb bones reveal our roots?</h4>



<p>There’s no doubt that fossils of a part of a leg and two forearms unearthed in 2001 in Chad are a window into the past. But what they can tell us about our own evolution has been hotly debated. The bones, which date to around 7 million years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-hominid-limb-fossils-sahelanthropus-tchadensis">belong to <em>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em></a> and confirm that the species walked upright, scientists reported (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 7</em>). That conclusion cements the species’ status as the earliest known hominid, those scientists argue. Other proposed early hominids are much younger, dating from about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-ancestor-gets-leg-walking">5 million to 6 million years ago</a>. But some scientists say the 7-million-year-old bones don’t clearly point to a two-legged gait and belonged instead to an ancient ape. With all the uncertainty, these findings may yet be walked back.</p>

<h4>Do tetraneutrons exist?</h4>



<p>Scientists have been on the hunt for six decades. Now for the first time they may have spotted an elusive quartet: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tetraneutron-four-neutron-cluster-physics-nuclear-forces">a cluster of four neutrons called a tetraneutron</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/22/22</em>). These clumps seem to last for a fleeting instant, less than a billionth of a trillionth of a second in an experiment reported this year. Studying the clusters could be a boon to researchers who want to know how neutrons behave within atomic nuclei. But disagreements among various theoretical calculations leave some experts unconvinced that tetraneutrons even exist.</p>

<h4>Is a mystery monkey a hybrid?</h4>



<p>An odd-looking primate spotted some six years ago <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-monkey-hybrid-borneo-habitat">in Borneo might be a rare hybrid</a>. But researchers won’t be sure until they can collect animal droppings for genetic analysis (<em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 11</em>). Photographs suggest that the primate’s mother is a silvered leaf monkey (<em>Trachypithecus cristatus</em>), its father a proboscis monkey (<em>Nasalis larvatu</em>s). If true, it’s a concerning coupling. Mating across genera suggests the two species are under extreme pressure, probably from the deforestation for oil palm plantations that’s fragmenting the habitat the monkeys share along the Kinabatangan River.</p>

<h4>Did humans arrive early in Europe?</h4>



<p>Humans may have migrated to Europe as early as 56,800 years ago, scientists reported based on discoveries at a rock-shelter in southern France. Those finds would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-humans-europe-migration-earlier-france-rock-shelter">put <em>Homo sapiens</em> on the continent about 10,000 years earlier</a> than previously thought and long before Neandertals died out (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 9</em>). The disappearance of the Neandertals, the work suggests, may have been a more complex and drawn-out process than had been realized. The researchers suggest that <em>H. sapiens</em> not only traded off occupation of the site with Neandertals, but also took survival tips. Still, the evidence rests on a single human tooth and tools that other researchers say could have been made by Neandertals.</p>

<h4>Has a &#8216;photon ring&#8217; been detected?</h4>



<p>Remember that stunning first picture of a black hole, unveiled in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope team? It showed the shadow of galaxy M87’s black hole on its swirling ring of hot matter. Well, astrophysicists announced this year that they had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disputed-photon-ring-supermassive-black-hole-image-eht">teased out a ring within a ring</a> in M87, identifying the thin circle of light created by the orbiting photons that are flung around the black hole before they fly toward Earth (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 8</em>). This “photon ring” would offer a new way to test what we think we know about gravity, but some researchers are critical of the methods used to identify the ring. A clear detection of the photon ring might have to wait for space telescopes to join the black hole–imaging effort.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/722342460/0/oupblogpsychology/">Domestic violence: deconstructing the “gender paradigm”</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/12/domestic-violence-deconstructing-the-gender-paradigm/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/police-car-480x185.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Until well into the 1980s, the problem of domestic violence, often referred to as intimate partner violence, or IPV, was considered a private matter, rarely talked about in public spaces, and under-prosecuted by law enforcement. Since then, laws have been enacted to protect victims and hold perpetrators accountable, and society has taken the problem more seriously, as evidenced by the proliferation of news stories on the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, it was the trial of the actor Johnny Depp that caught our attention. This time, surprisingly, we learned about violence perpetrated by the female partner in the relationship. Violence within their relationship appeared to be bilateral (wherein both disputants participate in abusive behavior). Despite all the conflicting evidence of&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.thecut.com/2022/12/amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-defamation-suit-what-to-know.html">abuse</a>&nbsp;and a judicial finding of culpability, Depp’s partner, Amber Heard continues to portray herself as the primary victim. In some quarters, the court’s findings were seen as a miscarriage of justice, a step backward in our common efforts to end domestic violence. Among others, it was proof that allegations of domestic violence cannot be trusted, especially by women, who are inclined to lie. So, which side is right?</p><p>The only reason for such polarization in a case that otherwise should never have gotten such scrutiny, is because most people—and not just the average citizen but, sadly, most policy makers and other stakeholders—hold mistaken and distorted beliefs about IPV. This is what some call the “gender paradigm,” which the Depp-Heard case put into question. This set of assumptions views IPV as a gendered problem, of men using physical and psychological aggression to dominate their female partners, either to maintain “male privilege” or due to jealousy or unresolved mental health issues. It also regards IPV as a unitary phenomenon of chronic, usually life-threatening assaults rather than the complex, heterogenous problem that it is. Most people don’t realize that the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs/NISVSReportonIPV_2022.pdf">lifetime prevalence of IPV</a> is 47.3% for women and 44.2%. Moreover, lifetime rates of IPV among <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/21961">gender minorities</a> are similar or higher to that of heterosexual couples. Bisexual men and women experience the highest rates of IPV, and almost 44% of lesbians and 26-50% of gay males experience IPV. Moreover, while data on transgender individuals is scant, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305774">current research</a> finds transgender and gender nonconforming individuals are 1.7 times more likely to experience any form of IPV compared to cisgendered and over two and a half times more likely to experience physical and sexual IPV over <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260518775148?casa_token=ywcMRn46CNQAAAAA:Pgpd8sSA9BQ9NuVjtjHK6R8olMXB_WBfqZxrykPHFyLnad6zERWWExiJo2qJLrilFWx65iqAFzJe">50%</a> have experienced IPV. Sexual minority youth have rates of physical and sexual IPV victimization higher than cisgender, heterosexual youth. </p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;The most accurate, up-to-date, statistics available indicate that in the United States, the UK, and Canada, women and men perpetrate physical and psychological IPV at similar rates.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>How is this an issue of male privilege or a gendered problem when rates of IPV are similar across gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity? Given the pervasiveness of the gender paradigm, it should be of no surprise that the reflexive response to the Amber Heard verdict among many who have dedicated their lives to protect female survivors of domestic abuse was to say, “They don’t get it.” Or: “victims should always be believed.” &nbsp;</p><p>Around the time that football player Ray Rice assaulted his wife in an elevator, an assault that was televised to millions, another NFL football player was stabbed in the neck with a screwdriver by his girlfriend, and almost no one heard about this incident. Most of us know some man, maybe even a family member, who has secretly been the target of abuse from a partner, who would be reluctant to share their experiences with anyone, much less initiate a call to the police. No surprise, therefore, that in some quarters the response to the Heard verdict has been to dismiss domestic violence as simply rich people arguing, and to regard all accusations as suspect and motivated by deceit. In other words,&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;believe women. Polarized reactions around domestic violence may now be akin to how our society has become politically divided in the broader sense.</p><p><em>Neither</em>&nbsp;response is correct. The case of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard merely demonstrates that, indeed, women are capable of abusing their partners, and that like many men in denial, they often lie about it and attempt to portray themselves as victims. Although women are arrested at rates far less than men, the most accurate, up-to-date,&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1891/1946-6560.3.2.e1">statistics</a>&nbsp;available indicate that in the United States, the UK, and Canada, women and men perpetrate physical and psychological IPV at similar rates, and that they are motivated for the same reasons—to control, out of frustration, to get revenge, and sometimes in self-defense. The research also finds that women and sexual minorities are far more likely to be sexually assaulted and, importantly, to incur the large majority of life-threatening injuries. It is also true that men, on the whole, due to cultural messaging requiring them to present a brave façade, are reluctant to identify as victims. It doesn’t help that when they do seek help, their concerns are typically dismissed or questioned. Similarly, sexual minorities face even greater obstacles such as heterosexist discrimination and are less likely to report IPV.</p><p>One may wonder, why is it such a big deal if a 6’2” guy is slapped by his 5’2” wife during a marital spat? Can’t he defend himself? If you put an average man in a boxing ring with an average woman, doesn’t the man “win” every time? The obvious problem with this analogy is that the settings and context in which couples argue, and sometimes come to blows, is far different. Most men are loathe to hit women, much less seriously injure them, due to codes of chivalry and the repercussions that would follow—not just the legal ones, but their diminished standing at home and in the community. While abusive men can instill greater fear of physical harm in their female victims, abusive women can, and do, instill in their male victims fear of being incarcerated, publicly humiliated, losing the children, and most of their assets in a divorce action. Furthermore, an abusive woman has the advantage of knowing that society is far more accepting of her behavior, and that she is far less likely to be arrested than a man for the same level of crime. Moreover, sexual minorities face additional fears. For example, gay couples involved in an IPV incident are often the same size and gender. Without the size and status differences, this often leaves law enforcement at a loss when trying to identify the primary or dominant aggressor, and unsurprisingly leads to more dual arrests. Sexual minorities also face a double dose of discrimination in terms of their sexual minority status and often fear reporting abuse will lead to their abusers “out” their sexuality or be treated poorly by law enforcement who rarely trained to respond effectively in such IPV incidents.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, if some domestic violence victims don’t get as seriously injured as their female counterparts, and often choose not to report assaults perpetrated against them, why should we care? Get to know the facts and you will know why. Without the same access to the peer-reviewed journals as university professors, the average person can look up the&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~/C%3A/Users/hensonm/Downloads/Partner%20Abuse%20State%20of%20Knowledge%20Project%20(PASK)">Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project (PASK)</a>. In&nbsp;<em>Gender and domestic violence: Contemporary legal practice and intervention reforms</em>, the authors draw on the PASK findings, and other contemporary research sources, to explain why IPV is a human problem, not a gender problem, and why we should indeed care very much about male victims and female perpetrators. Here are some of the reasons:</p><ul><li>Men, too, feel pain. A punch to the face may not hurt as much, but it still hurts, and an aggressive abuser can make up for their lesser size and strength by using weapons or assaulting their partners when they are vulnerable (e.g., intoxicated, asleep). About 20-25% of IPV homicide victims are male.</li><li>All victims are citizens with legal rights, and those rights are violated when law enforcement officers make an arrest in cases involving exaggerated or fabricated charges. Even victims with the financial means with which to fight these cases face a legal system and juries predisposed to find them guilty, often because they do not fit our stereotype of what an IPV victim is. The average heterosexual male or sexual minority defendant is usually advised to take a plea deal, with or without jail time, and a conviction on their record that may prevent them from obtaining further employment or securing custody time with their children. A disproportionate percentage of these individuals are people of color.</li><li>All victims, despite gender or sexual minority status, say that they are more impacted by psychological abuse, particularly when it is chronic and severe. The research indicates that women perpetrate serious, chronic psychological abuse as often as do men. Being called a “loser” in front of your children, or having your sexual performance ridiculed in front of your friends, is for male victims the equivalent of a woman being called a “slut,” and just as humiliating. Similarly, sexual minorities experience the stigma and share of not fitting into our heterosexist society, and often experience humiliation associated with internalized homophobia.</li><li>Children who witness their mother physically or emotionally abuse their father are just as likely to perpetrate similar acts in their dating and adult intimate relationships as if they witnessed dad’s abuse towards mom.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-war-invasion-ukraine-reshaping-science-climate">Here’s how Russia’s war in Ukraine is still reshaping global science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February horrified the world. Images of civilians fleeing their homes, broken bodies strewn across city streets, smoldering apartment complexes and mass graves have permeated the news and social media platforms ever since. This war has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced 14 million more.</p>



<p>Wars aren’t fought in a vacuum. The ripple effects of the war in Ukraine, from skyrocketing energy and food costs to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-soil-agriculture-crops">environmental damage</a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-nuclear-power-weapons-risk-physics">threat of nuclear disaster</a> (<em>SN: 7/2/22, p. 6</em>; <em>SN Online: 3/7/22</em>), have been felt around the globe — especially amid two other crises, the on­going coronavirus pandemic and climate change.</p>





<p>“A convergence of all these crises at the same time is very, very dangerous for the world,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in May.</p>



<p>We often look to science for solutions to the world’s problems. But this tectonic shift in the geopolitical landscape has upended global science collaboration, leaving many researchers scrambling to find solid footing. While the outcome of this change — like the outcome of the war itself — is uncertain, here are some examples of how the conflict has affected scientists and their research.</p>



<h4>Science in a war zone</h4>



<p>Ukraine’s infrastructure has sustained massive damage since the invasion began. Hospitals, universities and research institutions have not been spared.</p>



<p>Some scientists have sought refuge in other countries while roughly half remain in Ukraine, with male researchers between the ages of 18 and 60 expected to serve in the military, says George Gamota, a U.S.-based physicist who advises the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Gamota was born in Ukraine and moved to the United States as a child. He maintains close ties with his country of birth. When Ukraine became an independent country in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union, he helped advise Ukraine as it built its scientific infrastructure.</p>



<p>“When Russia attacked Ukraine, all hell broke loose. This situation really has not stabilized,” Gamota says.</p>



<p>Research funding in Ukraine has declined by 50 percent, he says. Scientific bodies across the globe have stepped up to offer aid through grants, job opportunities and resettlement programs. But monetary support, whether it’s from Ukraine’s government or independent organizations, still takes too long to reach scientists’ pockets, Gamota says. “Some are not getting anything.”</p>





<p>The National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine is already looking ahead to how to rebuild. In September, the organization met with its counterparts in Europe and the United States. Latvia, Poland and other places described how they restructured after the end of the Soviet Union, Gamota says. “It was an exercise that I think is important to have. But probably what the Ukrainians were looking for is how can the world help us right now.”</p>



<p>In March, the Breakthrough Prize Foundation donated $1 million to directly support Ukrainian researchers. The organization donated an additional $2 million in October for rebuilding efforts, a move that Gamota calls “fantastic.”</p>



<h4>Slowdowns for physics and space</h4>



<p>While science in Ukraine has struggled as the war drags on, Russian science has become more and more isolated. Sanctions from Western countries have directly and indirectly targeted Russia’s scientific enterprise.</p>



<p>In June, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced that the United States will <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/06/11/guidance-on-scientific-and-technological-cooperation-with-the-russian-federation-for-u-s-government-and-u-s-government-affiliated-organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“wind down” collaborations with Russia</a>, following an earlier ban on exports of U.S. technology there. The policy applies to national labs, as well as projects that receive federal funding and involve Russian government–affiliated universities and research institutions. Many research organizations in the West have also cut ties with collaborators in Russia.</p>



<p>These steps have particularly affected some large-scale collaborations in space and physics research.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-ukraine-war-space-science-nasa">mission delays</a> and the temporary shutdown of at least one space telescope (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 6</em>). The International Space Station, which is run jointly by NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, however, continues to operate normally for now.</p>



<p>In the world of high-energy physics research, the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva announced that it will not be renewing its <a href="https://www.home.cern/news/news/cern/cern-council-cooperation-agreements-russia-belarus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international cooperation agreements</a> with Russia and Belarus, which is aiding Russia’s invasion, when the contracts expire in 2024.</p>



<p>When that happens, the roughly 8 percent of CERN staff affiliated with Russian institutions, equaling about 1,000 researchers, will be unable to use CERN facilities. And Russia will stop contributing resources to experiments.</p>



<p>These measures strongly condemn the invasion “while leaving the door ajar for continued scientific collaboration should conditions allow in the future,” CERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti wrote in a memo to staff about the decision. Until 2024, Russian and Belarusian scientists can continue working on current collaborations, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-www-event-particle-physics-large-hadron-collider">ATLAS</a> — one of the detectors that spotted the Higgs boson in 2012 and is part of ongoing searches for theoretical particles, including dark matter (<em>SN: 7/2/22, p. 18</em>). But new efforts are prohibited.</p>

In the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, CERN said it would cut ties with Russia.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120298">Padi Prints/Troy TV Stock/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Science outside of Ukraine and Russia has not escaped the geopolitical maelstrom’s economic fallout. Rising energy costs — spurred by Russia cutting off exports of natural gas — are causing European research labs to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03257-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reassess their energy use</a>, the journal <em>Nature</em> reported in October. CERN is a major consumer, using the equivalent of about a third of Geneva’s annual average energy consumption.</p>



<p>The lab ended the run of its largest accelerator on November 28, two weeks ahead of schedule, to decrease its load on the electrical grid and prepare for surging prices and potential winter shortages. CERN officials announced that the number of particle collisions in 2023 will decrease, tightening competition among researchers for accelerator time, <em>Nature</em> reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The war also has put pressure on an already faltering global supply chain, which has led to shortages and shipping delays. The delays have created snags in the construction of ITER, the world’s largest nuclear fusion experiment that’s slated to open in 2025, in France. “We have been through thick and thin with this project, and we will manage,” says ITER spokesperson Sabina Griffith. ITER had been expecting a ring magnet and other equipment from Russia, one of seven partners along with the European Union and the United States. Due to intergovernmental contracts, Russia is still part of the project. But for now, “everything is put on ice,” Griffith says.</p>



<h4>A chilling effect on Arctic research</h4>



<p>Northern Russia is home to about two-thirds of Earth’s frozen soil, or permafrost. Collectively, the world’s permafrost contains almost twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere. With temperatures in the Arctic rising almost four times as fast as the global average, the region’s permafrost is thawing. </p>



<p>By the end of this century, the defrosted soil could exhale hundreds of billions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">tons of carbon dioxide and methane</a>, according to some estimates (<em>SN Online: 9/25/19</em>). To better understand how climate change is reshaping the Arctic and vice versa, researchers need detailed measurements of permafrost carbon, temperature, microbial communities and more.</p>



<p>But the deteriorating relationship between the West and Russia is “throwing a major wrench into bringing the data together so that we can get the clearest picture of the Arctic as a whole,” says Ted Schuur, an ecologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff and the principal investigator of the <a href="http://www.permafrostcarbon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Permafrost Carbon Network</a>. Now that much of the Arctic’s permafrost is inaccessible, Schuur and colleagues are looking for sites in North America and Europe that could serve as a proxy for Russian permafrost, he says.</p>



<p>Terminated collaborations, “while intended to ‘punish’ Russia, are realistically affecting the global Arctic community by limiting the researchers’ access to scientific information and undermining the resilience of Arctic (including notably Indigenous) communities,” Nikolay Korchunov, Russia’s ambassador-at-large for Arctic affairs, wrote in an e-mail to <em>Science New</em>s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_ukraine_permafrost.jpg" alt="A photo of thawing permafrost created a crater." class="wp-image-3120297" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_ukraine_permafrost.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_ukraine_permafrost-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3120297">The war in Ukraine has made it difficult to study climate change in the Russian Arctic, where thawing permafrost can create craters (one shown) and release greenhouse gases.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3120297">R. Gonzalez Suarez/CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Korchunov chairs the Arctic Council, an eight-member intergovernmental body that acts as a steward for the region, forging agreements on oil spill cleanup, commerce, wildlife conservation, climate change research and more. In March, the council’s other seven member nations — Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Norway and the United States — announced they would pause collaboration with Russia.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-limited-resumption-of-arctic-council-cooperation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work among the so-called “Arctic 7” continues</a>. But the freeze-out has derailed Russia’s planned <a href="https://www.caff.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biodiversity</a>&#8211; and <a href="https://www.amap.no/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pollution</a>-monitoring projects, Korchunov says. “A cold scientific environment only increases uncertainty and risks of an ineffective response to the warming Arctic.”</p>



<p>But some cooperation in the Arctic has continued, for now. Vladimir Romanovsky is a geophysicist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who studies permafrost temperature and relies on data provided by scientists in Russia. This year, his team got results, but whether his Russian collaborators will be able to take measurements in 2023 is unclear, Romanovsky says. “It is changing so quick, so fast that we don’t know what the situation will be by then.”</p>



<p>Most of the researchers in Russia that Romanovsky knows are struggling with funding. At the moment, there is enough money to keep his collaborators employed but not enough to do fieldwork. Cutting off Russian scientists from communication and data sharing is a “big, big problem,” Romanovsky says. They now are almost completely excluded from international meetings and collaborations, he notes. </p>



<p>In the long term, Romanovsky thinks that Russian science could lose many young researchers, like what happened in the 1990s when the Soviet Union collapsed. “They just went to go somewhere else,” he says, leaving to find work in other fields to continue to support their families. He and many others hope it won’t happen again.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-phosphorus-life-building-block-saturn-moon">The last vital ingredient for life has been discovered on Enceladus</a></h4>

              
                <p>CHICAGO — The last key ingredient for life has been discovered on Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus.</p>



<p>Phosphorus is a vital building block of life, used to construct DNA and RNA. Now, an analysis of data from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft reveals that <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1100137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enceladus’ underground ocean contains the crucial nutrient</a>. Not only that, its concentrations there may be thousands of times greater than in Earth’s ocean, planetary scientist Yasuhito Sekine reported December 14 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting.</p>





<p>The essential element may abound on many other icy worlds too, holding promise for the search for alien life, said Sekine, of the Tokyo Institute of Technology.</p>



<p>“We knew that Enceladus had most of the elements that are essential for life as we know it — carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur,” says Morgan Cable, an astrobiologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who was not involved in the research. “Now that [phosphorus] has been confirmed … Enceladus now appears to meet all of the criteria for a habitable ocean.”</p>



<p>Many researchers consider Enceladus to be among the most likely places to house extraterrestrial life. It’s a world encased in ice, with an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-core-water-ocean-saturn">ocean of salty water</a> hidden beneath (<em>SN: 11/6/17</em>). What’s more, in 2005 the Cassini spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-small-feisty">observed geysers</a> blasting vapor and ice grains out of Enceladus’ icy shell (<em>SN: 8/23/05</em>). And in that space-faring spray, scientists have detected <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0246-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organic molecules</a>.</p>



<p>But until now, researchers weren’t sure if phosphorus also existed on Enceladus. On Earth’s surface, the element is relatively scarce. Much of the phosphorus is locked away in minerals, and its availability often controls the pace at which life can proliferate.</p>



<p>So Sekine and colleagues analyzed chemical data, collected by the now-defunct Cassini, of particles in Saturn’s E ring, a halo of material ejected from Enceladus’ jets that wraps around Saturn.</p>



<p>Some ice grains in the E ring are enriched in a phosphorus compound called sodium phosphate, the researchers found. They estimate that a kilogram of water from Enceladus’ ocean contains roughly 1 to 20 millimoles of phosphate, a concentration thousands of times greater than in Earth’s big blue ocean.</p>



<p>At the floor of Enceladus’ subsurface ocean, phosphate may arise from reactions between seawater and a phosphate-bearing mineral called apatite, Sekine said, before being ejected through geysers into space. Apatite is often found in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-mud-balls-roamed-early-solar-system">carbonaceous chondrites</a>, a primitive, planet-building material (<em>SN: 7/14/17</em>).</p>





<p>But that’s not all. Many other icy ocean worlds may contain apatite as well, Sekine said. Similarly, they too could also carry high levels of phosphate in their oceans. That richness could be a boon for any potential alien organisms.</p>



<p>Though the findings are promising, they give rise to a glaring conundrum, Sekine said. “If life exists [on] Enceladus, why [does] such [an] abundance of chemical energy and nutrients remain?” After all, here on Earth, any available phosphorus is rapidly scavenged by life.</p>



<p>It’s possible that the moon is simply barren of life, Sekine said. But there’s another more hopeful explanation too. Life on frigid Enceladus, he said, may simply consume the nutrient at a sluggish pace.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/adult-mouse-brains-silent-synapses-memories">Adult mouse brains are teeming with ‘silent synapses’</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learning lots of new information as a baby requires a pool of ready-to-go, immature connections between nerve cells to form memories quickly. Called silent synapses, these connections are inactive until summoned to help create memories, and were thought to be present mainly in the developing brain and die off with time. But a new study reveals that there are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05483-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many silent synapses in the adult mouse brain</a>, researchers report November 30 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Neuroscientists have long puzzled over how the adult human brain can have stable, long-term memories, while at the same time maintaining a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-set-free">certain flexibility to be able to make new memories</a>, a concept known as plasticity (<em>SN: 7/27/12</em>). These silent synapses may be part of the answer, says Jesper Sjöström, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal who was not involved with the study.</p>





<p>“The silent synapses are ready to hook up,” he says, possibly making it easier to store new memories as an adult by using these connections instead of having to override or destabilize mature synapses already connected to memories. “That means that there’s much more room for plasticity in the mature brain than we previously thought.”</p>



<p>In a previous study, neuroscientist Mark Harnett of MIT and his colleagues had <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00064-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted many long, rod-shaped structures called filopodia</a> in adult mouse brains. That surprised Harnett because these protrusions are mostly found on nerve cells in the developing brain.</p>



<p>“Here they were in adult animals, and we could see them crystal clearly,” Harnett says. So he and his team decided to examine the filopodia to see what role they play, and if they were possibly silent synapses.</p>



<p>The researchers used a technique to expand the brains of adult mice combined with high-resolution microscopy. Since nerve cell connections and the molecules called receptors that allow for communication between connected cells are so small, these methods revealed synapses that past research missed.</p>



<p>The team looked for the typical signs of a silent synapse: the presence of a type of receptor called NMDA and the absence of others, known as AMPA receptors. Both of these types of receptors respond to the chemical messenger glutamate, but both typically need to be present for a synapse to be active. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the more than 2,000 synapses that the team looked at, about 30 percent were filopodia and, of those, nearly all had characteristics suggesting that they could be silent synapses.</p>



<p>To test whether the connections were truly silent, the researchers turned to glutamate. Artificially adding the chemical messenger was not enough to activate the synapses, the team found, suggesting that the connections were actually silent ones.</p>





<p>Adding an electrical current in addition to glutamate turned these connections from immature into mature synapses. That’s also what happens in the developing brain when a new memory is formed from a silent synapse.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether silent synapses are also prevalent in the adult human brain, though Harnett and other scientists like Sjöström think it’s likely. The researchers are now using the same techniques on human brains to find out.</p>



<p>Finding silent synapses in adult human brains could have implications for treating conditions such as drug addiction. Research on developing rats given cocaine suggests that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2721479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drug use generates more silent synapses</a>, which may then play a role in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24077564/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">withdrawal</a> symptoms. If scientists could develop a way to control the number of silent synapses, they could possibly target conditions that show abnormal levels of silent synapses.</p>



<p>What is clear is that silent synapses probably answer how the adult brain balances keeping old memories while making new ones, Harnett says. With this finding, “all of a sudden, solving that trade-off gets much easier.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-time-galaxy">How the James Webb telescope’s glances back in time are reshaping cosmology</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>BALTIMORE </strong>— The James Webb Space Telescope is living up to its promise as a wayback machine. The spectacularly sensitive observatory is finding and confirming galaxies more distant, and therefore existing earlier in the universe’s history, than any seen before.</p>



<p>The telescope, also known as JWST, has confirmed extreme distances to four galaxies, one of which sets a record for cosmic remoteness by shining about 13.475 billion years ago, astronomers reported December 12 at the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/events/stsci/2022/december/first-science-results-from-jwst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Science Results from JWST</a> conference. Dozens of other galaxies may have been spotted as they were just 550 million years or less after the Big Bang, meaning the light from those galaxies traveled at least 13.1 billion years before reaching the telescope.</p>





<p>Taken together, the new observations suggest galaxies formed earlier and faster than previously thought. “We’re entering a new era,” says astronomer Swara Ravindranath of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.</p>



<p>That new era is thanks in part to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">JWST’s ability to see very faint infrared light</a> (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>). For the most distant objects, like the first stars and galaxies, their visible light is stretched by the relentless expansion of the universe into longer infrared wavelengths that are invisible to human eyes and some previous space telescopes. But now, measurements that were recently impossible are suddenly easy with JWST, researchers say.</p>



<p>“JWST is the most powerful infrared telescope that has ever been built,” astrophysicist Jane Rigby said at the conference. Rigby, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is the JWST operations project scientist. “Almost across the board, the science performance is better than expected.”</p>



<p>Even in the very first image, released in July, astronomers spotted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">galaxies whose light originated 13 billion years ago</a> or more (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). But those distances were estimates. To measure the distances precisely, astronomers need spectra, measurements of how much light the galaxies emit across many wavelengths. Those measurements are slower and more difficult to make than pictures.</p>



<p>“Thanks to this glorious telescope, we’re now getting spectra … for hundreds of galaxies at once,” said astronomer Emma Curtis-Lake of the University of Hertfordshire in England.</p>



<p>Among those are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four of the earliest galaxies ever seen</a>, some of which existed less than 400 million years after the Big Bang, Curtis-Lake and colleagues reported at the meeting and in a paper submitted December 8 to arXiv.org. The team spotted these record holders in a patch of sky that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-found-galaxies-may-be-farthest-back-time-and-space-yet">the Hubble Space Telescope once scoured for ultra-remote galaxies</a> (<em>SN: 1/3/10</em>).</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-spitzer-telescope-mission-ends-look-back-discoveries">previous distance record holder</a> existed between 13.3 billion and 13.4 billion years ago, or about 400 million years after the Big Bang (<em>SN: 1/28/20</em>). JWST confirmed the distance to that galaxy and came back with three more whose light comes from as early as 325 million years after the Big Bang.</p>





<p>The galaxies are also surprisingly pristine, chemically speaking, lacking in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.</p>



<p>“We don’t see that in the present-day universe,” says Ravindranath, who was not involved in the new discovery. It could mean that not many of the galaxies’ stars have died in supernova explosions that spread heavy elements around the universe, which suggests the galaxies’ original stars were not extremely massive.</p>



<p>In another part of the sky, JWST has spotted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 galaxies</a> that may have existed about 550 million years or earlier after the Big Bang, astronomer Steven Finkelstein and colleagues reported at the meeting and in a paper submitted November 10 to arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“On an emotional, visceral level, looking at these images is amazing,” said Finkelstein, of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>



<p>The first of these to be discovered, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac966e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dubbed Maisie’s Galaxy</a> after Finkelstein’s daughter, appears to be just 380 million years after the Big Bang, the researchers reported December 1 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. The most distant galaxy in the team’s survey might lie as much as 130 million years earlier than Maisie. Those galaxies’ distances still need to be confirmed with spectra, but the team expect to get those data in the next few weeks.</p>

Finkelstein, M. Bagley, Z. Levay</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And distant galaxies that lie behind a massive galaxy cluster called Abell 2744 are also more numerous and distant than expected, astrophysicist Guido Roberts-Borsani of UCLA said at the meeting.</p>



<p>Before JWST observed the cluster, astronomers predicted it should find effectively zero galaxies from 13.2 billion years ago. “But we found two,” said Roberts-Borsani, who reported the results at the meeting. “So something’s a little bit weird.” It could mean that galaxies form earlier and faster than thought, he said, although it could also mean that JWST was just looking at a particularly galaxy-rich patch of the sky.</p>



<p>All these new galaxies are exciting because they could be responsible for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-evolution-supercomputer-animation-stars-galaxies">making the universe transparent to visible light</a>, a process astronomers call reionization (<em>SN: 12/2/22</em>). Before the first stars ignited, the universe was filled with a hot dense soup of particles. The first stars and galaxies bathed the universe in ultraviolet light, splitting electrons off hydrogen atoms and allowing light to zip through until it reached JWST.</p>



<p>The new data, Roberts-Borsani said, “give us constraints on when this process started, ended, and which galaxies were the culprits for this process.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-juno-jupiter-moons-mission">NASA’s Juno spacecraft’s mission has lasted longer than expected</a></h4>

              
                <p>Juno’s unprecedented views of Jupiter and its moons are a gift that keeps on giving.</p>



<p>The NASA spacecraft was originally slated to end its mission in 2018 after completing 34 orbits of the giant planet. It&#8217;s now on orbit 47. How long scientists will get this front-row view of these worlds isn’t clear, particularly as the spacecraft zooms ever closer to the gas giant and the powerful, destructive radiation of its magnetosphere.</p>



<p>But Juno is tough, said space physicist Scott Bolton, principal investigator for the Juno mission, at a December 14 news conference in Chicago at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. The spacecraft “is built like an armored tank, and its shields are holding,” said Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute, which has headquarters in San Antonio. &nbsp;</p>





<p>After entering a wide orbit around Jupiter in 2016, Juno’s images quickly began to help scientists peer into the planet’s mysteries, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-polar-cyclones-planet">a geometric array of cyclones around its poles</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-magnetic-field-surprisingly-weird">the strange, convoluted shape of its magnetic field</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/18; SN: 9/5/18</em>). Juno spied <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exotic-lightning-jupiter-clouds-nasa-juno-images">lightning storms zipping across the tops</a> of the planet’s clouds, and revealed that Jupiter is the only planet other than Earth known to host ephemeral, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-atmospheric-lights-sprites-elves-earth">lightning-generated atmospheric glows</a> known as sprites and elves (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>; <em>SN: 11/2/20</em>).</p>



<p>Juno has also passed by some of the planet’s moons, flying by Ganymede in 2021. Ganymede “is bathed by Jupiter’s magnetic field,” and Juno was able to observe, among other things, a tug of war of magnetic field lines between the planet and its moon, said space physicist Thomas Greathouse, also of the Southwest Research Institute.</p>



<p>In September, Juno flew by Jupiter’s moon Europa, capturing in new detail the chaotic crisscrosses of cracks, ridges and bands in the moon’s icy surface. Now the spacecraft is on its way toward Io, the innermost moon.</p>



<p>While Juno seems to be going strong, “the end could come in two different ways,” Bolton said. Juno could become too degraded by the intense radiation to function — or it could simply run out of propellant, which is needed to keep its antennas pointed toward Earth. If that happens, “it could be collecting data, but can’t send it back.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-volcano-erupt-more-magma-found">No, Yellowstone isn’t about to erupt, even after more magma was found</a></h4>

              
                <p>More liquid magma lurks beneath the Yellowstone supervolcano than scientists once thought. But don’t panic: That amount of magma, researchers say, is still nowhere near enough to portend an eruption any time soon.</p>



<p>That reassurance comes courtesy of new state-of-the-art seismic images that give the sharpest picture yet of what lies beneath Yellowstone.</p>



<p>“It’s like getting a better lens for your camera. Things are coming into more focus,” says Michael Poland, a geophysicist who was not involved in the research. “We’re even less worried about an eruption now — and I wasn’t worried before,” adds Poland, who is the scientist-in-charge at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Yellowstone Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.</p>





<p>The volcano beneath Yellowstone National Park has garnered interest — and worry — because it has had some of the most explosive, dramatic eruptions in the geologic record, he says. In the last 2.1 million years alone, Yellowstone has had three catastrophic eruptions, generating continent-wide ashfalls and disrupting the global climate. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sinking-melting-ancient-tectonic-plate-may-fuel-yellowstones-supervolcano">most recent of those catastrophic outbursts</a> was about 631,000 years ago, forming a crater about 70 kilometers across (<em>SN: 1/2/18</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Yellowstone’s subterranean magma chambers mostly contain hardened, cooled crystals that are mixed in with some amount of molten material. How much magma there is relative to crystals can determine how ready a volcano is to erupt. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The average amount of liquid magma in the volcano’s underbelly</a> is between 16 and 20 percent, Ross Maguire, a geophysicist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and colleagues report in the Dec. 2 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The “critical melt fraction” at which the volcano might be prepared to erupt is more like between 35 and 50 percent, the team notes.</p>



<p>Previously, researchers had estimated Yellowstone’s melt fraction as between 5 and 15 percent. The new estimates don’t represent an actual change — they’re based on a reanalysis of existing seismic data that required far more computational power than was possible in the past.</p>



<p>“We’re not absolutely pushing the limit in terms of what we can do,” Maguire says, “but we’re getting kind of close.”</p>





<h4>Peering beneath Yellowstone</h4>



<p>To “see” beneath the surface, scientists use information gleaned from the speeds of different types of seismic waves as they travel through the ground. Seismic waves known as “S waves” are particularly useful when looking for melt because these waves slow down considerably when they encounter any liquid, such as water or molten magma. </p>



<p>Researchers use the time it takes for an S wave to travel from a transmitting source to a receiver, compared with the time it takes for other types of seismic waves that don’t slow down in liquids, to estimate how much melted magma there is.</p>



<p>Before the rise of supercomputers, scientists would imagine the seismic waves as moving along a simple line from point A to point B. Then they would convert the travel time for the wave to a velocity and from there estimate some amount of liquid present.</p>



<p>But waves don’t really move in a line; they radiate outward. They diffract. When encountering a subsurface feature that could slow them down, they might bend around it rather than barrel through it. Those additional wave movements add a lot of fine detail to the picture — but they also require a lot of computational power.</p>



<p>Today, such calculations are possible. So Maguire and colleagues used this more modern way of looking at seismic waves — called full waveform tomography — to reanalyze existing seismic data from Yellowstone.</p>



<p>Peering between three and eight kilometers underground, the team recorded S waves as slow as about 2.1 kilometers per second, occurring near the center of Yellowstone’s caldera. That’s appreciably slower than previous estimates of 2.7 km/s, Maguire says, pointing to more melt.</p>



<p>It’s not certain how the melted part of the magma is distributed. But the most likely scenario is that most of the liquid is isolated, tiny amounts of melt locked away in the spaces between the hardened crystals. Still, the team notes, it can’t rule out the possibility that there are larger pockets of molten magma scattered about.</p>



<h4>Yellowstone set to simmer?</h4>



<p>One interesting implication, Maguire says, is that “Yellowstone may spend large portions of its life cycle with higher melt fractions than thought.” That contradicts the classic view that the volcano’s magma chambers are usually filled with cooled crystals, punctuated by rapid injections of magma before an eruption. Instead, Yellowstone may just be in a long-standing simmering state.</p>



<p>But a bit of simmering is a far cry from about to erupt, Poland says, and these new findings “help to drive home the point that this system is mostly solid.” That’s probably why it hasn’t erupted even small amounts of magma in nearly 70,000 years. </p>



<p>That doesn’t mean Yellowstone is quiescent: It’s still a hot, active volcanic system with hazards, Poland notes. For example, in recent decades there have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-steamboat-geyser-reawakened-no-eruption">deadly steam explosions</a> and landslide-triggering earthquakes (<em>SN: 1/11/21</em>).</p>



<p>Those more likely hazards don’t get as much attention as fears of a catastrophic eruption. “It’s kind of a bogeyman for people and a clickbait topic, and it’s sad,” Poland says. “It’s an interesting place that has so much to offer, and people are focused on the thing that won’t happen in our lifetime.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-long-covid-lingering-symptoms-treatments">2022 was the year long COVID couldn’t be ignored</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year, the world had to face the growing burden of long COVID. A tidal wave of people with lingering symptoms — some mild, some profoundly disabling — commanded attention.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-patients-symptoms-doctors-research-clinics-brain-fog-fatigue">We are in the middle of a mass disabling event</a>,” physician Talya Fleming of the JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute in Edison, N.J., told <em>Science News </em>(<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 22</em>). A recent estimate suggests that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.12.22279862v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 18 million people in the United States have long COVID</a>. Yet researchers know little about the disease and how to treat those who are suffering.</p>





<p>One key question is: Who is at risk? The search for risk factors has yielded few clear answers. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-epstein-barr-link-risk">Women may be slightly more likely than men to get long COVID</a>, as are people who had more than five symptoms during their initial week of COVID-19 (<em>SN: 10/8/22 &amp; 10/22/22, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Part of what confounds simple answers is that long COVID can hit multiple body systems, leading to fatigue, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-smell-sense-loss-olfactory-training-treatment">smell loss</a>, memory trouble, blood clots and even sensations of internal tremors that feel like earthquakes (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 14</em>).</p>



<p>Symptoms could be due to persistent virus hiding out in the body, as well as the body’s responses to the intruder. Micro blood clots, antibodies that turn against the body, inflammation and even disturbances of helpful bacteria are all being scrutinized for their roles in the disease.</p>



<p>The lack of clarity is what makes finding treatments so hard. Doctors at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-clinics-map-locations-prevalence">long COVID clinics, which are few and far between</a>, are scrambling to ease people’s symptoms, often borrowing therapies from other disorders that cause similar problems, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 25</em>).</p>

<p>The long list of unanswered questions has taken on new urgency given the swell of people experiencing long COVID. Epidemiologist Priya Duggal of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and colleagues suspect that between 10 and 30 percent of people who get COVID-19 may go on to get long COVID. That fits with federal data suggesting that about 30 percent of U.S. adults who have had COVID-19 have experienced long COVID. But surveys, medical records and other data all come with flaws, so exact numbers are impossible to come by, she says.</p>



<p>What’s perhaps most useful, Duggal says, is to consider how many people are severely constrained by their illness. “These are the people [who] were living happy, healthy lives and now they’re not,” she says. About 1 to 5 percent of people who had COVID-19 may fall into this category, she estimates. That sounds like a tiny number, she says, but “even if it’s 1 percent, it’s 1 percent of all people who have had COVID. And that’s just a really, really large number.” An estimated 100 million people in the United States have had COVID-19. That’s probably an undercount, Duggal says.</p>





<p>In the first days of the pandemic, Duggal and colleagues wanted to collect as much biological data on people as they could, before COVID-19 tore through the world. But logistics and a lack of funding prevented those baseline studies. “Had we had some of that in place, we could now be asking better questions and getting better answers,” she says. “I would hope that some of what this has taught us is that the next time this happens — and let’s hope it is no time soon — we have a bit more thought about what’s to come.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran will talk about a paper &quot;Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Battling against Covid-19: A Literature Review&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Colloquially known as coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
has become a matter of grave concern for every country around the world. The
rapid growth of the pandemic has wreaked havoc and prompted the need for
immediate reactions to curb the effects. To manage the problems, many research
in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial
Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in
tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the
applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease
via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying
severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology,
pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a
comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the
difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI
approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing
of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is
comprehensible. Such a picture, although full of details, is very helpful in
understand where AI sits in current pandemonium. We also tried to conclude the
paper with ideas on how the problems can be tackled in a better way and provide
some suggestions for future works.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medical-terms-jargon-meaning-doctor-patient-confusion">Some common medical terms may be more confusing than doctors think</a></h4>

              
                <p>Medical language can sometimes stump patients. And some common sayings are straight-up head-scratchers.</p>



<p>Calling a patient’s neurological exam “grossly intact,” for example, might not sound so great, says Michael Pitt, a pediatrician at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis. But it actually means that everything is normal and working as expected.</p>



<p>In 2021, Pitt and his colleagues asked 215 adults at the Minnesota State Fair to decipher that language and 12 other medical sayings a patient might hear from a doctor or read in their notes. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2799079?resultClick=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People can trip up on familiar words and phrases</a> that have one meaning in everyday English and an entirely different meaning in medicine, the researchers report November 30 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>





<p>Only about 20 percent of people surveyed, for example, understood what it meant when their doctor said, “The findings on the X-ray were quite impressive.” In plain language, that means the doctor is giving you bad news, Pitt says — the opposite of what some patients might expect.</p>



<p>When surveyed, doctors overwhelmingly agree that they should avoid medical jargon when speaking with patients, Pitt says. But many don’t even know they’re doing it. There’s a technical term for this too, Pitt adds: “jargon oblivion.”</p>



<p>He’s hoping his team’s results give doctors an “aha moment” and some awareness about phrases that might be puzzling patients. If a doctor says something that’s unclear, Pitt says, he wants patients to feel empowered to speak up.</p>



<p>He’s coached his family for years on this. When they go to the doctor, there’s one question in particular he wants them to ask. Before they leave an appointment, they’ll summarize what the doctor has said and ask, “Am I getting this right?”</p>



<p>“That type of phrase is amazing to have in your back pocket,” Pitt says.</p>

                "Later today, the House of Commons will vote to approve Bill C-18, the Online News Act, sending it to the Senate just prior to breaking for the holidays. While Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez and media lobbyists will no doubt celebrate the milestone, it should not go unremarked that the legislative process for this bill has been an utter embarrassment with an already bad bill made far worse. The government cut off debate at second reading, actively excluded dozens of potential witnesses, expanded the bill to hundreds of broadcasters that may not even produce news, denigrated online news services as “not real news”, and shrugged off violations of international copyright law. All the while, it acknowledged that mandated payments for links are the foundation of the bill with officials stating that individual Facebook posts accompanied by a link to a news story would be caught by the law. As for the purported financial benefits, the government’s own estimates are less than half those of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who also concluded that more than 75% of the revenues will go to broadcasters such as Bell, Rogers, and the CBC. The end result is a bill that will undermine competition and pose a threat to freedom of expression, while potentially leading Facebook to block news sharing in Canada and Google to cancel dozens of existing agreements with Canadian news outlets...."

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-climate-change-bill-legislation-clean-energy">2022’s biggest climate change bill pushes clean energy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The world needed bold climate action this year, and we got it.</p>



<p>California and other states announced plans to phase out gas-powered cars after 2035. The United States ratified an international treaty to slash production of the climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons used in cooling and refrigeration. The European Union is finalizing its plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent relative to 1990s levels by 2030. The list of legislative victories goes on. </p>



<p>But the biggest win came August 16, when President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>





<p>The historic legislation marks the first major move by the United States, which has emitted more carbon dioxide than any other country, toward neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions. It gets the ball rolling by investing $369 billion into accelerating the adoption of wind, solar and other renewable energy sources and decarbonizing the economy. By the end of the decade, the act will help cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/publication/updated-inflation-reduction-act-modeling-using-the-energy-policy-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 40 percent of the levels in 2005</a>, when U.S. emissions nearly peaked, scientists project, bringing the nation within reach of fulfilling <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its pledge</a> to halve emissions by 2030.</p>



<p>The legislation is no panacea for the climate emergency, but researchers and activists are optimistic that it will be the helping hand that clean energy needs to flourish. “There would be no way to really mitigate the climate crisis without the investments in this bill,” says Raul Garcia, a legislative director at Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law organization.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at some of the law’s major provisions and a few of its limitations.</p>



<h4>Cheaper clean energy</h4>



<p>The law aims to ease and incentivize the transition away from fossil fuels by creating tax credits that reduce the cost for companies to adopt clean energy. For instance, small businesses can qualify for credits that support up to 30 percent of the cost of transitioning to solar power.</p>



<p>The act also aims to help consumers, with $9 billion for rebates that help people ditch gas and buy appliances powered by electricity, such as electric induction cooktops and heat pump water heaters. Households can also get up to $7,500 in tax credits for electric vehicle purchases.</p>





<p>“It’s huge,” Denise Mauzerall, an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University, says of the law’s potential to advance clean energy. But if the United States is to take full advantage of the increased clean energy capacity, it will be crucial to also construct sufficient infrastructure to deliver that energy, she notes. The bill offers only some support to build overhead power lines and other ways to transmit energy. “Without transmission,” she says, “we will really slow ourselves down.”</p>



<h4>Clean energy jobs and goods</h4>



<p>A major goal is to build up a clean energy economy by promoting high-quality jobs in industries such as solar and wind. To maximize tax credits, companies must pay workers a “prevailing wage” and employ apprentices to work a minimum number of hours on clean energy projects.</p>



<p>The legislation also invests in the domestic manufacturing of clean energy goods. Tax credits of up to 30 percent are available to companies that build or recycle wind turbine blades, solar panels, energy storage equipment and other clean energy products, and funds grants to retool factories to make electric vehicles.</p>

<h4>Reducing pollution</h4>



<p>Methane — a greenhouse gas that can trap more than 25 times as much heat as CO<sub>2</sub> — is another target. The legislation devotes $850 million to the monitoring and mitigation of methane emissions from fossil fuel operations. It also establishes a fine for operations that annually release amounts of methane that exceed 25,000 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent.</p>



<p>And CO<sub>2</sub> is legally defined as an “air pollutant,” cementing the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate its production under the Clean Air Act.</p>



<p>But there’s more to the climate problem than decarbonizing today’s pollutive energy industry, Mauzerall says. “Going forward, we need to pay more attention to reducing emissions from the agricultural sector,” she says. About <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions</a> and about a third of global emissions <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">come from agriculture</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 22</em>).</p>



<h4>Climate justice</h4>



<p>Billions of dollars are slated to go toward climate justice, a movement that confronts the disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities. Funding includes $2.8 billion in grants for community-based projects, such as those that increase energy efficiency in affordable housing developments or monitor air quality in marginalized communities.</p>



<p>“But there are some troubling provisions,” Garcia says. The law authorizes new offshore oil and gas leases and provides fossil fuel companies with carbon capture and sequestration tax credits. These could prolong the life of pollutive oil and gas operations, which are often located near marginalized communities. </p>



<p>It will be crucial to follow these investments with laws that enforce both climate justice and the clean energy transition, Garcia says. “We need rules and regulations that hold industries’ feet to the fire, to make sure that those investments are going where they need to.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-snakes-clitorises-evolution">Scientists thought snakes didn’t have clitorises. They were wrong</a></h4>

              
                <p>Female snakes have clitorises too, a new study finds.</p>



<p>The research raises the possibility that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sex lives of snakes are more complicated and diverse</a> than previously understood, researchers report December 14 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Clitorises are found in a wide range of vertebrate life, from crocodiles to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphin-female-clitoris-sexual-anatomy">dolphins</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 1/10/22</em>). One exception is birds, which lost their clitorises over the course of their evolution. Female snakes appeared to have lost the sex organ too, which was puzzling, since their close lizard relatives possess paired clitorises, called hemiclitorises. Male lizards and snakes have accompanying paired phalli, or hemipenises.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This element of female snakes’ sexual anatomy went unexamined in detail for so long partly because hemiclitorises can be fragile and easy to miss, but also because female genitalia have historically been considered “quite taboo,” says evolutionary biologist Megan Folwell of the University of Adelaide in Australia.</p>



<p>“Even in humans, the proper function and significance of the human clitoris was still being discussed in 2006,” she says.</p>



<p>Conflicting accounts of snake hemiclitorises in some scientific papers led Folwell to take a detailed look.&nbsp;She first examined a euthanized female common death adder (<em>Acanthophis antarcticus</em>). “I just started with dissecting the tail and going into it with a really open mind of what I might find,” she says.</p>



<p>She was “pleasantly surprised” to find dual organs within that were completely different from the hemipenises found in male snakes. Also, unlike lizard hemiclitorises, the snake’s couldn’t turn out externally.</p>



<p>To confirm she wasn’t looking at a lump of some other tissue, Folwell and her colleagues carefully examined sections of the organs under a microscope. The team also soaked the tail in iodine, which allowed the soft tissues in the genital region to be seen with greater resolution using X-rays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These analyses showed that the tissues were fundamentally different from the male snake’s hemipenises. The female organs were full of primarily collagen rather than muscle fibers running through the structure. Another analysis showed the organs had “heaps of nerves” throughout them, Folwell says, suggesting they probably have substantial tactile sensitivity. Like other species’ clitorises, the snake’s showed a robust blood supply. </p>





<p>The team expanded its study to eight more snake species across four families, revealing a dizzying array of clitoral diversity. For instance, Folwell says, the hemiclitorises of the Mexican cantil viper (<em>Agkistrodon bilineatus</em>) are huge, filling the space of the tail. “Then you see the Ingram&#8217;s brown snake, which was so teeny tiny. If you didn&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re looking for, it definitely could have been missed,” Folwell says.</p>



<p>Some hemiclitorises are thin and lay atop the scent glands, while others are sandwiched between or even a combination of on top and between, she adds.</p>

Folwell <em>et al</em>/<em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Snakes are thought to have evolved from lizard ancestors. The findings show that, evolutionarily speaking, the snake clitoris “wasn’t lost; it was just changed,” says Diane Kelly, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who wasn’t involved with this study.</p>



<p>Folwell and her colleagues think the hemiclitorises may be stimulated during courtship and mating behaviors, such as the twisting together of tails. This may make the female more receptive, encouraging longer and more frequent mating and enhancing the chances of fertilization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s been often believed that, in snakes, it&#8217;s been all about coercion, and all about the male driving mating,” Folwell says. “It may be a little bit closer toward seduction in some species.”</p>



<p>Going forward, Folwell wants to look further into how nerves in hemiclitorises are involved in any touch sensitivity and function during mating.</p>



<p>Kelly notes that comparing hemipenises and hemiclitorises of the same species could help get an idea of the organs’ function in snakes, and potentially reveal any back-and-forth evolution between males and females.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s 2022, and here&#8217;s a brand-new anatomical finding in a really common animal,” Kelly says. “There&#8217;s a lot of anatomy that we still don&#8217;t know yet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunga-tonga-volcano-eruption-touched-space-lightning">The Hunga Tonga volcano eruption touched space and spawned a lightning blitz</a></h4>

              
                <p>When the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano in the Pacific Ocean erupted earlier this year, the event was one for the record books — in several surprising ways.</p>



<p>The January 15 eruption was so explosive that it injected water vapor so high that it touched space, a first-of-its-kind observation for an earthly volcano. And the event produced the greatest concentration of lightning ever detected — making it far flashier than the 2018 eruption of Krakatau in Indonesia or the 2021 tornado outbreak across the U.S. South.</p>





<p>The eruption also released so much energy that its disturbance of a charged layer of Earth’s atmosphere, called the ionosphere, rivaled that of a solar geomagnetic storm.</p>



<p>Seismologists, geophysicists and oceanographers described these and other eruption superlatives at a news conference on December 12 and in several presentations in Chicago at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting.</p>



<p>“These are once in a lifetime … observations,” said Larry Paxton, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.</p>



<p>He and colleagues examined data from NASA’s Global Ultraviolet Imager, on a spacecraft in orbit around the Earth. On the day of the eruption, Paxton said, the instrument revealed “something unusual” in the far-ultraviolet light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum: a roundish spot in the satellite data coinciding with the volcano’s location where there was a temporary decrease in those UV emissions.</p>



<p>The instrument doesn’t see anything in the atmosphere below about 100 kilometers above sea level, what’s typically thought of as the boundary of space. That means that some sort of emitted material — most likely water vapor from the undersea volcano — had <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1092781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached high enough into space to briefly absorb those particles of light</a>, the researchers reported. Scientists had previously estimated that the eruption extended past the stratosphere and into the mesosphere. The new finding suggests the explosion reached even higher.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-history-south-pacific">volcano woke up in December 2021</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/22</em>). By early January, the ongoing eruption was already “one of the most prolific lightning producers” on the planet, said Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist with Vaisala Inc., an environmental instruments company headquartered in Vantaa, Finland.</p>



<p>Using Vaisala’s Global Lightning Detection Network, Vagasky and colleagues estimate that on the day of the big blast on January 15 alone, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1157048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were at least 400,000 lightning strikes at and around the volcano</a> — an order of magnitude higher than generally observed in Earth’s most powerful supercell thunderstorms, Vagasky said. “This was the most extreme lightning event ever detected by the global network.”</p>





<p>Some of the volcano’s explosive energy made it to the ionosphere, the layer of Earth’s atmosphere where charged plasma coexists with other atmospheric particles. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-tsunami-shock-wave">Atmospheric pressure waves from the eruption propagated into space</a>, shifting the plasma around (<em>SN: 8/29/22</em>).</p>



<p>Those plasma shifts then rippled along Earth’s magnetic field lines, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1160627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resonating through the ionosphere to disturb plasma thousands of kilometers away</a>. “It’s like plucking a guitar string,” said Claire Gasque, a space physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. (<em>Gasque is the daughter of </em>Science News<em>’ news director, Macon Morehouse, who wasn’t involved in this article.)</em></p>



<p>In the vicinity of the volcano, that effect on the ionosphere from the January 15 eruption rivaled, and even surpassed, the impact of a minor solar geomagnetic storm that began on January 14, Gasque added. “Despite a simultaneous geomagnetic storm, the volcano dominated changes in ionospheric dynamics.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Most people think of space weather as caused by solar influences,” Gasque said. But these data suggest a volcano can have just as much power.</p>



<p>The volcano may yet break other records, the researchers said, as scientists continue studying data from the powerful explosion.</p>

                <p>Thanks to a bit of good luck, the Mars rover Perseverance has captured the first-ever sound of a Martian dust devil.</p>



<p>The NASA rover has witnessed dusty whirlwinds before. But when this one swept right over Perseverance, the rover’s microphone happened to be turned on. So the first-of-its-kind data include <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35100-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sounds of dust grains</a> either pinging off the microphone or being transmitted to the mic through the rover’s structure, researchers report December 13 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>Because the rover’s microphone is turned on only occasionally, the team estimates that such events, when they occur, might be recorded just around 0.5 percent of the time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On September 27, 2021, Perseverance’s navigation camera spotted a dust devil (purplish cloud in the images at top, which were processed to reveal the dust) whirling toward it from 50 to 60 meters away. As the whirlwind swept across the rover, Perseverance’s microphone recorded the sound it made, capturing the first-ever audio of a Martian dust devil (middle), and the rover’s instruments detected a slight drop in atmospheric pressure (bottom). These data may someday help researchers better understand dust dynamics on Mars.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wind speeds in the walls of the dust devil reached nearly 40 kilometers per hour, planetary scientist Naomi Murdoch of the Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace in Toulouse, France, and colleagues report. As with previous whirlwinds detected by other instruments, this late-morning dust devil caused a slight drop in atmospheric pressure and rise in temperature as it swept over the rover on September 27, 2021. It was 25 meters in diameter, at least 118 meters tall and ambled by at about 20 kilometers per hour.</p>



<p>One big surprise, Murdoch says, is that a prodigious amount of dust was airborne in the calm center of the whirlwind as well as in the brisk winds that formed its walls. Data from this event, as well as from other whirlwinds measured by the rover’s instruments, will help researchers better understand <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satanic-winds">how dust gets lifted off the Martian surface</a> (<em>SN: 10/24/06</em>).
