<p>The publisher Wiley has fired the chief editor of the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> after he <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">resigned</a> over conflicts with the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/michael-n-dawson">Michael Dawson</a>, a professor at the University of California, Merced, submitted his resignation on June 21, <a href="https://twitter.com/MNDlab/status/1671563513268158464?s=20">tweeting</a> that he made the decision “because journal management declined to explore productive solutions to a suite of challenges facing the journal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also tweeted: </p>



<span id="more-127647"></span>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://journalofbiogeographynews.org/2023/06/21/chiefeditor-resign-jbiogeography/">blog post</a>, Dawson listed several concerns from his resignation letter, including proposed growth targets for the journal, equity issues in adopting an open access model in which authors pay fees to publish their work, and compensation for the editors. He <a href="https://twitter.com/MNDlab/status/1671563512064389122?s=20">tweeted</a> that the journal’s December issue would be his last.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley, however, confirmed through a spokesperson that “we are working through him to a contractual termination date of August 27th.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawson told Retraction Watch that he was not available to speak before the end of the week.</p>



<p>Besides Dawson’s resignation and now firing, the journal has lost a deputy editor in chief, and the majority of its associate editors have been refusing to handle new submissions for the past month, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/20/journal-editors-resign-strike-in-dispute-with-wiley-over-business-model-that-maximises-profit/">we’ve previously reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The associate editors cited opposition to switching the journal to a full open access model, a proposed increase to the journal’s output, and automatic referral of rejected manuscripts to other Wiley journals as the issues that triggered their work stoppage, set to end yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dispute between the editors of the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em> and Wiley is the latest in which journal editors have recently <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/05/editors-of-public-health-journal-resign-over-differences-with-publisher/">resigned</a><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/26/editors-in-chief-of-aging-journal-resign-en-masse-after-impasse-with-the-anatomical-society-and-wiley/"> en masse</a>, or <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/second-elsevier-journal-board-threatens-mass-resignations">threatened to resign</a>, due to similar conflicts with for-profit publishers.</p>



<p>Update, 8/2/23, 0230 UTC: Following the publication of this post, a Wiley spokesperson tells us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Wiley informed journal editors on July 14 that there are no plans to flip the Journal of Biogeography to open access but that we continually evaluate our journals to ensure they stay aligned with subject areas and funding trends. We also informed editors at that time that the Journal of Biogeography is no longer enrolled in the referral program.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-los-angeles-thread-millipede">The newfound Los Angeles thread millipede is ready for its close-up</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite living in the entertainment capital of the world, the Los Angeles thread millipede has avoided the limelight. But when researchers spotted it, they knew they’d found a creature worthy of center stage.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/102537/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newfound species (<em>Illacme socal)</em></a> is small, pale and lives at least 10 centimeters under the soil, researchers report June 21 in <em>ZooKeys</em>. It’s just the third known species in this genus, a group of millipedes that stands out for their subterranean lifestyles and isolation from relatives.</p>





<p><em>I. socal</em> “looks like somebody plucked a thread out of their shirt,” says Paul Marek, a millipede biologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>



<p>Naturalists Cedric Lee, of the University of California, Berkeley, and James Bailey discovered the millipede on a slug-finding expedition in Lake Forest, Calif., in 2018. While hunting for gelatinous gastropods, they stumbled upon a millipede unlike any they’d seen before. The duo uploaded a record of their find to iNaturalist, an app that lets users share photos of organisms they find with others, and identified the specimen as a member of the Siphonophoridae family.</p>



<p>Marek, also an iNaturalist aficionado, has alerts set up for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/millipede-most-legs-eumillipes-persephone">these kinds of critters</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). The discovery piqued his interest because the only other places he knows this family from in California are hundreds of kilometers north of Los Angeles. Lake Forest is roughly 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of the city. So Marek teamed up with Lee and Bailey to solve the myriapod mystery.</p>



<p>During a visit to California over Christmas, Marek went to Lake Forest to look for more millipedes. “We collected around 10 individuals to get a good understanding of the variation” in what the critter looks like, he says. He then studied the males’ gonopods — sperm transfer organs that evolved from leg segments — to see if they matched any known species. “They were distinct,” Marek says. Genome sequencing confirmed that the Los Angeles millipedes are a newfound species.</p>

Marek <em>et al</em>/<em>ZooKeys</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Marek dubbed the species <em>I. socal </em>on the suggestion of Lee, but the team also wanted to be sure to give the millipede an easily recognizable stage name: the Los Angeles thread millipede. “If species are known by their common names,” Marek says, “it&#8217;s helpful for subsequent conservation action.”</p>



<p>While many other millipedes can be found close to the surface, those in the <em>Illacme</em> genus like to dig deep. “They live this almost completely subterranean lifestyle,” says Derek Hennen, a myriapod biologist at the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville who was not involved in the study but who has worked with Marek. So it’s not too surprising that the newfound species went undiscovered for so long. The closest relatives of <em>Illacme</em> are “either in South Africa or maybe Chile,” Hennen says.</p>



<p>Marek says <em>I. socal </em>is proof of the startling amount of hidden diversity in the soil beneath us. “This is really a frontier of biodiversity. There&#8217;s a lot more stuff under our feet.”</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/miyazaki.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/miyazaki.jpeg?resize=150%2C150" alt="" class="wp-image-124134" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Toshiaki Miyazaki</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The president of Aizu University in Japan has resigned after two investigations found he had self-plagiarized or double-submitted a dozen papers.</p>



<p>Toshiaki Miyazaki was also found to have “filed an application for a project subsidized by the national government without going through the university official procedures,” which “caused confusion,” <a href="https://u-aizu.ac.jp/en/information/20230727Resignation.html">according to Aizu</a>. He resigned effective today [July 31].</p>



<p>The move comes more than a year after the first investigation, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/03/university-president-in-japan-self-plagiarized-and-will-forfeit-some-pay/">we reported</a>, which concluded in February 2022 and found that Miyazaki had self-plagiarized four papers. At that time, he had to forfeit 20% of one month’s salary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A month later, according to a <a href="https://u-aizu.ac.jp/files/bd9068b00200f3ef518c913848267fdf4c4311c3.pdf">report issued last week by the university</a>, Miyazaki “self-reported that there were 12 papers suspected of self-plagiarism.” A preliminary investigation then began, with a full investigation starting in April and lasting until February of this year.</p>



<span id="more-127644"></span>



<p>The university’s committee reviewed 54 papers, finding&nbsp; Miyazaki guilty of self-plagiarism in three and double submission in five. The committee defined the former as new papers that failed to cite previous overlapping work by Miyazaki, and the latter as papers that cited the previous work but did not advance it.</p>



<p>The papers were published between 2008 and 2016, and were studies of sensor networks. The committee determined that none of Miyazaki’s co-authors was at fault.</p>



<p>Miyazaki appealed the findings in February 2023. The committee reinvestigated, changing one of the double submissions to a case of self-plagiarism but keeping the other findings the same. They recommended retraction of the double submission papers, and correction of the self-plagiarism cases.</p>



<p>The report found that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In regard to the papers written on the development of systems, Professor Miyazaki thought that it did not constitute self &#8211; plagiarism to re &#8211; use the same sentences and figures used in his own papers previously published without citations to explain the common parts of the system in his new papers . He also thought that to some extent addition of contents different from previous papers to new papers without citations did not constitute double submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Such practices are, some argue, a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/leap.1550">gray area</a>.</p>



<p>Miyazaki also believed that after patenting his work, “he should publicize the technology repeatedly by using the opportunity as means to publish papers,” the report said. He also “failed to check the paper submission rules including the manuals and policies of the publishers to which he submitted the papers,” and “did not pay attention to the changes in the concept of research misconduct, such as the establishment of the Guidelines for the Prevention of Research Misconduct by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in 2006 and the revision of the same guidelines in 2014.”</p>



<p>The committee concluded Miyazaki “significantly neglected the basic duty of care expected of a researcher,” and “thought that data and research results of his students enrolled at the university belonged to him as they were under his supervision and not able to discuss with him on an equal footing.” He also included a student in the acknowledgements of a paper rather than as an author “due to the situation that it was difficult to contact them after their graduation.”</p>



<p>The university said it would make several changes in response to the episode, including “Providing provisions to categorize misconduct other than fabrication, falsification and plagiarism, such as self &#8211; plagiarism and double submission in concrete terms, and adding the provisions to ensure the effectiveness of research ethics education.”</p>

<p><strong><strong>Oldest rocks</strong> </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/natural-sciences-0"><em>Science News</em></a>, July 21, 1973</p>



<p>Until recently, Greenland possessed the oldest known rocks in the world. They <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/greenland-rocks-younger-still-old">date back 3.7 billion years</a> (<em>SN: 12/9/72, p. 374</em>). Now granite and crystalline schist specimens … suggest that the Antarctic Continent is older. These specimens date back 4 billion years.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Update:</h4>



<p>At about 4.3 billion years old, bedrock in northeastern Canada currently holds the title of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/remnants-earths-original-crust-preserve-time-plate-tectonics">oldest known rock on Earth</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/17, p. 8</em>). In Western Australia, scientists have found zircon crystals in bedrock that are even older, dating to about 4.4 billion years ago. For comparison, Earth is only about 4.5 billion years old. </p>



<p>Since these ancient materials preserve information about early Earth, they have fueled ongoing debates about when and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/age-earths-crust-confirmed">how Earth’s crust formed</a>, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">plate tectonics started</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/41-billion-year-old-crystal-may-hold-earliest-signs-life">when life on the planet first arose</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/14; SN: 5/2/22; SN: 10/19/15</em>). Additional clues that could help resolve the debates might lie on the moon. Lunar samples collected by Apollo 14 astronauts contain <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X19300202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4-billion-year-old zircons</a> that may have been delivered via an Earth meteor, scientists reported in 2019.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/russell-taichman.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="233" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/russell-taichman-233x300.jpeg?resize=233%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-125707" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/russell-taichman.jpeg?resize=233%2C300&amp;ssl=1 233w, https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/russell-taichman.jpeg?w=465&amp;ssl=1 465w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Russell Taichman</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Less than a year after he became dean of the University of Alabama Birmingham School of Dentistry, an uncomfortable email landed in <a href="https://www.uab.edu/dentistry/home/people/faculty/russell-taichman">Russell Taichman’s</a> inbox. </p>



<p>Overlapping and duplicated panels in one of Taichman’s 2005 papers were among a list of complaints relayed by the publisher of <em>Cellular Signalling </em>in the April 2020 correspondence – complaints which were <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/15BDB9EC8B2E38E8A42D012280864A">publicly posted on PubPeer</a> by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">Elisabeth Bik</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The substance of the complaint is image manipulation, which if true, would violate our publishing policies,” the email stated. “Please note that if we do not have an adequate and timely response, we may be forced to conclude that the allegations are truthful.”</p>



<p>The paper, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656805000677">“Diverse signaling pathways through the SDF-1/CXCR4 chemokine axis in prostate cancer cell lines leads to altered patterns of cytokine secretion and angiogenesis”</a>, eventually became the first of five of Taichman’s papers to be retracted. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/26/dental-school-dean-up-to-five-retractions-for-cancer-research-papers/">first reported</a> on the retractions last September.&nbsp; Since then, following a public records request, we’ve obtained <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Responsive-Documents_Redacted.pdf">20 pages of redacted emails</a> that reveal the story behind the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127633"></span>



<p>As it turns out, Taichman himself pushed for one retraction, although the journal editor deemed an investigation unnecessary, and he initiated at least another two of the five of the retractions in an apparent bid to correct the scientific record. The emails reveal the now-former dean – who remains a professor at UAB after stepping down from his leadership post in July “to focus on teaching and scholarship” –&nbsp; began to suspect that his postdoctoral student at the time, Jianhua Wang, was to blame for the problematic data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All five of the retracted papers were published when Taichman was a <a href="https://dent.umich.edu/directory/rtaich">professor of periodontics and associate dean for research</a> at the University of Michigan. He took on the role of dean in Alabama in July 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exchanges between Taichman, Wang and several journal publishers offer a rare look behind the scenes of the process of scientific correction.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Just two hours after receiving the first email from the publisher, Taichman forwarded it to Wang.&nbsp;Taichman wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Hope all is well. I received this below. I am not sure how to handle it but on the surface there looks as if there are issues which I did not know. Can you please help explain these or I am going to have little choice but to address this which could mean withdrawing the paper.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wang, who did not respond to our request for comment, replied:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I agree that this is a very serious charge. I double check my copy of notebook kept in my office and found the raw data is limited. Most of data were kept in UM lab. I will answer the concerns point to point as shown below in bold black. However, based on current situation of USA, the best way is that you make a final decision to withdraw the paper. Sorry for bringing this trouble to you AND I am also self-blamed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given the date – April 2020 – Wang may have been referring to the COVID outbreak in the US at the time as the “current situation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wang was a postdoctoral fellow in Taichman’s lab at the University of Michigan from 2005 to 2010. He was the first author of the five retracted papers, and was responsible for the primary generation of data and assembly of figures, according to the University of Alabama’s Open Records office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wang returned to China in 2010.</p>



<p>In June 2020, the journal publisher contacted Taichman again, writing that the editor-in-chief would not take the investigation of the paper further. But that wasn’t good enough for Taichman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September the same year, Taichman wrote back saying he had been “mulling the issue”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I appreciate that the Editor in Chief has concluded their investigation into our work. Never the less, I would like to request retraction of the paper. Letting the record stand as incorrect, just does not sit right with me. I have corresponded with all the authors, they have suggested multiple fixes but in the end, I am not in a position to repeat the experiments, and I am still not able to travel during the pandemic to obtain the primary data.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He goes on to suggest two versions of a retraction notice, the first of which placed the blame squarely on Jianhua Wang.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The corresponding author of the paper Wang et al, Cellular Signalling, Volume 17, Pages 1578-1592, 2005 would like to retract the above paper as he has become aware that the some of the figures including Figure 1B, and Figure 6A were duplicated by the first author. The corresponding author wishes to convey sincere regret to the editor and readers of the journal of Cellular Signaling.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109909">retraction notice</a> that was eventually published in January 2021 does not blame Wang, instead crediting Bik for discovering the image duplications.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Inspired by the initial complaints from <em>Cellular Signalling, </em>Taichman combed through papers from his lab in search of other anomalies in the work that Wang had contributed to, according to the FOIA emails. He spotted an image from the <em>Cellular Signalling </em>paper that was replicated in a later <em>Cancer Research </em>paper, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2971">A Glycolytic Mechanism Regulating an Angiogenic Switch in Prostate Cancer”</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2020, Taichman sent an email to the editors at <em>Cancer Research</em> describing his findings and attaching other complaints about the paper <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F812B34F81256487E17917D064C584">made on PubPeer</a>, again by Bik.</p>



<p>“I am intent on correcting the scientific record,” he wrote. “Many of the images were duplicated and while I might not agree with all the issues, there are enough which are indisputable from my perspective.</p>



<p>The next sentence revealed the incident was apparently not isolated to Taichman:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Further, this AM I reached out to one of my major collaborators [redacted] who published a paper with Dr. Wang independent of my involvement. Sadly, this issue with Dr. Wang was not unique to me, and apparently the issue was flagged some time ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, I am embarrassed and not clear how I missed these issues.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The paper was eventually <a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-0464">retracted in March 2021</a>. Wang and two other authors did not respond to the journal’s correspondence about the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two more of Taichman and Wang’s papers in the journal were later retracted in September 2022, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-2398">“Characterization of Phosphoglycerate Kinase-1 Expression of Stromal Cells Derived from Tumor Microenvironment in Prostate Cancer Progression”</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-2399">“CXCR6 Induces Prostate Cancer Progression by the AKT/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signaling Pathway”</a>, for similar issues with duplicated images. Wang and several other authors did not respond about those retractions, either. It is not clear from the emails we obtained whether these retractions were prompted by Taichman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2021, Taichman again alerted staff at the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> to several problems in the paper <a href="https://doi-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/10.1074/jbc.M707465200">“The Role of CXCR7/RDC1 as a Chemokine Receptor for CXCL12/SDF-1 in Prostate Cancer</a>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As it turns out Dr. Jianhua Wang (1st Author) who was a post-doc in my laboratory when I was at U/ Michigan in the early 2000s, duplicated several pieces of the data,” he wrote. “Clearly I am embarrassed. But I am committed to doing the right thing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102126">notice</a> published in the journal in July 2022 stated that the authors had opted to withdraw the paper “to correct the scientific record,” except for Wang who could not be contacted. The paper was the most highly cited out of the five retractions, with 454 citations since its publication in 2008, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Taichman says that the emails obtained through a Alabama Open Records Act request “speak for themselves” in showing that Wang admitted guilt and that he worked diligently to correct the scientific record as soon as he became aware of the issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dr. Wang took advantage of trust, and it is safe to say the team and our collaborators certainly wish we had identified the issues in real time,” he wrote in an email in response to our questions. “We remain committed to proactively correcting the scientific record wherever necessary.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another seven of Taichman’s papers on PubPeer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=taichman">have been flagged</a> for potential image anomalies, Wang is listed as a co-author on one of them. So far, two of the seven have been corrected.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324007012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blight</a><br><em>Emily Monosson</em><br><em>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $28.95</em></p>



<p>In the summer of 1904, American chestnut trees in the Bronx were in trouble. Leaves, normally slender and brilliantly green, were curling at the edges and turning yellow. Some tree limbs and trunks sported rust-colored splotches. By the next summer, almost every chestnut tree in the New York Zoological Park, now the Bronx Zoo, was dead or dying. By around 1940, almost every American chestnut across its native range, the eastern United States, was gone. The trees had been felled by a microscopic fiend: <em>Cryphonectria parasitica</em>, a fungus that causes chestnut blight.</p>





<p>That fungus had been imported on Japanese chestnut trees. Once it arrived on U.S. soil, it spread like wildfire, driving the American chestnut (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) to functional extinction. </p>



<p>Today, some still grow, though only as immature trees popping up from the still-living roots of long-gone trees. But these shoots have no hope of towering over the forest as chestnut trees once did, standing as tall as a nine-story building. Because <em>C. parasitica </em>persists in the environment, the saplings are doomed to die from the moment they sprout.</p>



<p>The fate of the American chestnut is only one example of the devastation fungi can spawn. In her new book, <em>Blight:</em> <em>Fungi and the Coming Pandemic</em>, author Emily Monosson presents an eye-opening, and at times grisly, account of fungal diseases that threaten pine trees, bananas, frogs, bats and, increasingly, people.</p>



<p>Not all fungi are bad. In fact, “most fungi give life,” Monosson explains. By helping to decompose dead organisms, fungi recycle essential nutrients. But as people travel or trade plants and animals around the globe, foreign fungi hitch a ride to places they don’t belong and come into contact with organisms not accustomed to living with them — sometimes with deadly consequences.</p>



<p>Those consequences are the focus of the first half of the book. Monosson kicks off with the topic that might seem most pressing: Do fungi pose a threat to people? Fortunately, humans — and other mammals — run too hot for most fungi. “Our bodies are like Death Valley,” Monosson writes. An internal temperature of 98.6° Fahrenheit (37° Celsius) is white-hot for organisms that prefer 54° to 86° F (12° to 30° C). </p>



<p>What’s more, our immune systems are quite adept at fending off potential fungal foes. So while people who are immunocompromised are at higher risk for fungal infections, serious cases are relatively uncommon compared with other infectious diseases.</p>



<p>But climate change could push fungi to adapt to higher temperatures. Monosson highlights <em>Candida auris</em>, which evolved in the last decade or so to infect people and is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-deadly-fungus-drug-resistance">spreading fast in health care facilities</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/23, p. 5</em>). Other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">fungal infections in people</a>, such as valley fever, might also spread to new places alongside higher temperatures (<em>SN: 12/4/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<p>Fungal pandemics in other species offer lessons for how devastating fungal diseases can be. Monosson describes these outbreaks in morbid detail.</p>

<p>Fusarium wilt strangles the plants that provide the world with yellow bananas. Carcasses of bats, starved to death by <em>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</em>, the cause of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/probiotic-bacteria-spray-bats-deadly-white-nose-syndrome">white nose syndrome</a>, litter caves across the United States (<em>SN Online: 7/15/19</em>). Researchers studying frogs in Central America and elsewhere watch in horror as populations dwindle and disappear, suffocated by <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, or chytrid.</p>



<p>At this point in the book, I felt hopeless. Perhaps <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-humans-zombies-last-of-us-science">HBO’s hit series <em>The Last of Us</em></a><em> </em>is a real glimpse into the future (<em>SN Online: /21/23</em>). But never fear, evolution can step in and provide “glimmers of hope,” Monosson writes. Affected plants and animals can adapt to better handle fungal foes. (Contrary to what Monosson says, however, pathogens don’t evolve for their own good in ways that make them more benevolent to their hosts. They change in ways that ensure spread.)</p>





<p>A handful of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/harlequin-frogs-lazarus-species-extinction-comeback">frog populations flattened by chytrid are appearing again</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/22, p. 6</em>). In Yosemite National Park, frogs infected with the fungus show no sign of disease. Trees may be building resistance too. Some whitebark pine trees (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>) in the western United States have genes that render them resistant to white pine blister rust, a disease that has been afflicting the trees for more than a century.</p>



<p>People are also stepping in to help. And given our role in spreading fungal diseases, maybe we have an obligation to, Monosson argues. Fattening up bats in the fall, for example, could help them survive white nose syndrome, which robs the animals of fat stores during winter hibernation. Some researchers are even looking to natural resistance to find solutions, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/any-hope-old-chestnuts">efforts to resurrect American chestnuts</a> (<em>SN: 5/3/03, p. 282</em>). Botanists hope that by genetically altering the trees, “someday the chestnut may rise again, taking its place among the oak and hemlock,” Monosson writes.</p>



<p>For now, the best hope may be preventing fungal diseases in the first place. “When humans first began moving animals and plants, cut forests, expanded agricultural lands, there was no thought to planetary protection,” Monosson writes. “Now we know better.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/playful-behavior-rats-area-brain">Playful behavior in rats is controlled by a specific area of their brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rats are extremely playful creatures. They love playing chase, and they literally jump for joy when tickled. Central to this playfulness, a new study finds, are cells in a specific region of rats’ brains.</p>



<p>Neurons in the periaqueductal gray, or PAG, are <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(23)00477-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active in rats during different kinds of play</a>, scientists report July 28 in <em>Neuron</em>. And blocking the activity of those neurons makes the rodents much less playful.</p>



<p>The results give insight into a poorly understood behavior, particularly in terms of how play is controlled in the brain. “There are prejudices that it&#8217;s childish and not important, but play is an underrated behavior,” says Michael Brecht, a neuroscientist at Humboldt University in Berlin.</p>





<p>Scientists think play helps animals develop resilience. Some even relate it to optimal functioning. “When you&#8217;re playing, you’re being your most creative, thoughtful, interactive self,” says Jeffrey Burgdorf, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the new study. This is the opposite of depressive states, and Burgdorf’s own research aims to turn understanding the neuroscience of play into new therapies for mood disorders.</p>



<p>For the new study, Brecht and colleagues got rats used to lab life and being tickled and played with in a game of chase-the-hand. When rats play, they squeal with glee at a frequency of 50 kilohertz, which humans can’t hear. The researchers recorded these ultrasonic giggles as a way of measuring when the rats were having fun.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Watch rats engage in play behavior with researchers and each other | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azeBn5CRWxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">To explore how a specific brain region in rats might relate to their well-documented play behavior, researchers tickled rats on their bellies and backs and played chase-the-hand. Rats also played together, chasing and play-fighting. Ultrasonic giggles, processed to make them audible to humans, coordinate social play and show that the rats are having fun.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Brecht and colleagues suspected the PAG — a deep, midbrain region connecting the forebrain to the lower brainstem that’s involved in many automatic functions and instinctual responses — might be involved in play behavior, partly because it controls these vocalizations. If your playmate stops laughing, it is time to stop play-fighting.</p>



<p>The team recorded activity from individual cells in rats’ PAGs while they played chase-the-hand or were tickled. Cells located in two columns down the sides of the PAG were active during play, the researchers found. “These cells really go crazy, especially in response to tickling,” Brecht says. Importantly, the same cells were active during both chasing and tickling. “This was where we thought: These are the cells,” Brecht says. “They’re not about moving, or touch. They’re about fun.”</p>



<p>Making the rats anxious by putting them on an elevated, brightly lit platform suppressed playfulness and giggles, and reduced activity in these “fun” cells.</p>



<p>The researchers then genetically altered the cells so they could be turned off using light. Blocking activity in just these cells caused the rats to play much less and become less ticklish, as shown by an absence of giggles, the team found.</p>



<p>These results suggest that the PAG is required for play, probably as part of a circuit. Brecht and colleagues have previously found play-responsive neurons <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giggling-rats-help-reveal-how-brain-creates-joy">in the somatosensory cortex</a>, a brain region responsible for perceiving touch (<em>SN: 11/10/16</em>). However, other research has shown that animals without a cortex still play. Brecht doesn’t think the same will be true for animals lacking the play-associated part of the PAG. “We think it&#8217;s a control structure for playfulness.”</p>



<p>Understanding this circuitry better may help researchers improve <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemical-imbalance-explain-depression">their knowledge of depression in people</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/23</em>). “The people that really, really need help are the ones that can&#8217;t play,” Burgdorf says. The new study is a step toward understanding what that looks like in the brain, which could one day help clinicians choose the best treatments for different patients, Burgdorf says.</p>



<p>The team plans to study this region in other animals to see how it might differ across species and to see if it helps explain why some animals are more playful than others, Brecht says. One of the first things Brecht did after realizing its importance in rats was look at the region in humans. “And guess what? It’s very large,” he says. “That&#8217;s not a coincidence: No animal plays as many games as we do.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-poop-climate-warming-methane-red-algae">Cow poop emits climate-warming methane. Adding red algae may help</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth has a cow problem. Cow agriculture is one of the largest emitters of climate-warming methane to the atmosphere.</p>



<p>But adding a type of red algae known for its methane-inhibiting properties to cow feces might help. Doing so <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1187838/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces the production of methane within feces</a> by about 44 percent, researchers report July 13 in <em>Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems</em>. That offers a promising new avenue to reduce overall methane emissions from cattle, the scientists say.</p>





<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-creative-cut-methane-cows">Cow agriculture</a> is responsible for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">nearly a quarter of the world’s emissions of methane</a>, a potent greenhouse gas (<em>SN: 11/18/15; SN: 5/5/22</em>). Bacteria in the cows&#8217; guts make methane during digestion that is then released to the world, mostly via burps. A smaller — but not insignificant — amount of methane is also emitted directly from the cows’ feces during decomposition.</p>



<p>Researchers have been actively seeking solutions to the gut-produced methane. Adding just a pinch — 0.5 percent of the dry feed — of the red algae <em>Asparagopsis taxiformis </em>to the cows’ food can prevent <a href="https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(21)00092-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 65 percent of that methane production</a>.</p>



<p>Ubiquitous in tropical ocean waters, <em>A. taxiformis</em> contains an organic compound called bromoform, which inactivates an enzyme that normally helps the methane reaction along. This research has raised concerns that the milk of dairy cows fed the algae may contain toxic levels of bromoform as well as iodine in their milk and meat. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has assessed bromoform as a probable human carcinogen, and too much iodine can cause thyroid malfunction.</p>

<p>Mohammad Ramin, an animal scientist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Umeå, and colleagues wondered whether it might be possible to cut out the middleman — by adding the algae directly to the cows’ poop. That wouldn’t reduce the gut-produced methane, but it might reduce overall cattle emissions without impacting meat or milk.</p>



<p>Methane emitted from feces is primarily a problem when it comes to dairy cows, says Sara Place, an animal scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who was not involved in the study. Dairy cows tend to be raised in environments with more oxygen-poor soils, and methane-producing bacteria thrive in such anaerobic environments. Cows raised for beef tend to live out their lives and defecate in open pasturelands or in an enclosed, but dry, feedlot, which is less conducive ground for methane production.</p>



<p>In the new study, Ramin and colleagues added algae to four dairy cows’ feces. Two had been fed the algae, and two hadn’t. Each fecal sample was divided further, with one subsample given additional algae and the other left alone. Then, all the fecal samples were allowed to incubate, slowly decomposing in the laboratory. After nine weeks, the team analyzed the subsamples to see how much methane they contained.</p>



<p>As expected, adding algae to the cows’ food did initially reduce methane in their poop. But once the poop began to decompose, the production of new methane wasn’t affected by whether the cows had eaten the algae or not. The team also examined the microbial communities living in the different types of poop, and they found that there wasn’t much difference between the algae-fed cows and the control cows. That suggests that algae food supplements aren’t that effective at inhibiting methane production outside the stomach.</p>



<p>But adding the algae directly to the feces did make a noticeable difference to methane coming from decomposition. That, the team says, suggests that this would be an effective part of the solution to the larger cow-methane problem.</p>



<p>The major strength of this new work is that it focuses on providing a solution to an understudied part of the cow-methane problem, says Christopher Glasson, a chemist at the University of Waikato in Tauranga, New Zealand, who studies agrichemicals derived from seaweed. But ultimately, he says, it may just not be cost-effective to produce <em>A. taxiformis</em> for this particular purpose. “I think [this strategy] is likely to be nonviable due to the cost of the production of the seaweed.”</p>





<p><em>A. taxiformis</em> may still be most effective at suppressing fermentation in a cow’s guts rather than in its manure. The good news, Glasson says, is that state-of-the-art feed additive technologies that use specific extracts from the algae rather than the whole biomass greatly mitigate the risk of iodine or bromoform toxicity.</p>



<p>And the study’s conclusion that algae in the cows’ feed doesn’t affect methane production in their feces might also be good news, in a way, Place says. One proposed avenue for mitigating emissions from cow feces is to harness the methane to make biogas. “If you feed [algae] to cattle for methane mitigation [and] if you don’t see any results [in the manure], that could be good for biogas production,” she adds — a possible two-fer for the industry.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geometry-architectural-problem-bee-wasp">How geometry solves architectural problems for bees and wasps</a></h4>

              
                <p>Honeybees and yellow jackets don’t look much like mathematicians — for one thing, they’re smaller. But collectively, the insects can solve a common architectural conundrum using a geometric solution that they evolved independently of each other.</p>



<p>As their colonies grow, these bees and wasps eventually need to increase the size of the hexagonal cells that make up their nests. But nest material is expensive, and it’s hard to efficiently combine hexagons of different sizes into a single continuous array. Both the honeybees and wasps have solved this problem <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by mixing in some pairs of five-sided and seven-sided cells</a>, which bridge the gap between different sizes of the six-sided hexagons, researchers report July 27 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>. This fix is close to the optimal solution to this problem, the team says.</p>





<p>“We’ve known for a long time that the hexagonal comb bees and wasps use is the most efficient, stable shape,” says Lewis Bartlett, a honeybee biologist at the University of Georgia in Athens who was not involved with the study. “But mixing different-sized hexagons is tricky.”</p>



<p>Social insect colonies, like those of honeybees and some wasps, are run by female workers who raise the offspring of their mother, the queen. They do this in hexagonal cells that honeybees build out of wax and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-glow-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescence">wasps construct from paper</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/21</em>). At a certain point in its life cycle, the colony needs to switch from raising workers to raising reproductives, like males and new queens. These reproductives are often bigger than the workers, which means the hexagonal cells need to get bigger too.</p>

<p>“Think of someone tiling your bathroom floor,” says Michael Smith, a biologist at Auburn University in Alabama. “If you have two different sizes of hexagons, and you&#8217;re going to group the small ones on one side and the big ones on the other side, you&#8217;re inherently going to have some kind of an issue when you try to fit them together.”</p>



<p>To figure out how bees and wasps solve this tiling puzzle, Smith and colleagues analyzed 115 images of colonies of five species of honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>, <em>A. cerana</em>, <em>A. dorsata</em>, <em>A. florea </em>and <em>A. andreniformis</em>), four species of <em>Vespula </em>wasp (<em>V. vulgaris</em>, <em>V. maculifrons</em>, <em>V. flavopilosa</em> and <em>V. shidai</em>), commonly known in North America as yellow jackets, and one species of paper wasp (<em>Metapolybia mesoamerica</em>). </p>



<p>Using an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2103605118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated image analysis tool</a> developed by team member Kirstin Petersen, a roboticist at Cornell University, the scientists extracted data from 22,745 cells such as lengths of cell walls and how many neighbors each cell has. (Smith also verified the data for each one of the cells by hand. “I was the unfortunate sap,” he says, “but I was also happy to do that.”)</p>



<p>The automated tool allowed the team to get data from irregular cells that aren’t perfect hexagons, which many scientists had ignored due to the difficulty of measuring them manually. These seemingly misshapen cells turned out to be anything but.</p>



<p>When transitioning from small worker cells to big reproductive cells, all the bees and wasps built pairs of adjoining five-sided and seven-sided cells to bridge the gap. A five-seven pairing has the same number of open sides as a pair of hexagons — both types of conjoined pairs have 10 sides available to connect to other cells — so it doesn’t disrupt the pattern. And the larger size of the seven-sided cell allows the bees and wasps to seamlessly start making larger hexagons on the other side of it. “They&#8217;re always building the five-sided cell first, and then the seven-sided cell,” Smith says.</p>



<p>Colleague Nils Napp, a computer scientist at Cornell University, designed a mathematical model of this strategy and found that what the bees and wasps are doing is close to the optimal geometric solution.</p>



<p>The most efficient way to build an array of shapes such that each cell is big enough to raise a baby bee or wasp can be represented by a Delaunay triangulation. Imagine a sheet of paper marked with dozens of dots. Then, fill the sheet with triangles by connecting only neighboring dots. Finally, around each triangle, draw a circle that touches each corner. In the layout of a Delaunay triangulation, no dot is inside any of those circles. Drawing additional lines that connect centers of neighboring circles produces a tiling of polygons, much like the latticework of hexagons found in the bee and wasp nests.</p>

<p>Napp’s model shows that adding bigger hexagons to the nest slowly inches the whole array away from perfection, such that gaps may form or the workers may need to build an unusable cell to keep the nest together. The optimal thing to do is to add a five-seven pair just as the Delaunay condition is about to be violated. Across the bee and wasp species, about 85 percent of all nonhexagonal cells are in five-seven pairs, just like the model predicts.</p>



<p>The bees and wasps used in this study are separated by 179 million years of evolution and build their nests out of different materials. “But both evolved to use this five-seven rule for transitioning between hexagon sizes,” Bartlett says. “Evolution has a tendency to solve challenges optimally.”</p>

<p><em>Science</em> has rescinded an expression of concern it issued one month ago after the authors provided data that “addressed concerns about the integrity of the paper.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal had published the expression of concern for the 2021 article “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abh2890">Light-induced mobile factors from shoots regulate rhizobium-triggered soybean root nodulation</a>” after two separate readers contacted the editorial team about an issue in the paper, as <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/29/science-paper-marked-with-expression-of-concern-after-readers-pointed-out-data-issue/">we reported</a> at the time. The expression of concern noted that &#8220;that data presented in Fig. 5 assessed GmNSP1 expression rather than GmNIN expression.&#8221;</p>



<p>The article has been cited 43 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal is publishing the newly submitted data as a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj7468">correction</a>, as well as an <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj7040">editor’s note</a> explaining the removal of the expression of concern. The new notice states: </p>



<span id="more-127605"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These changes have addressed concerns about the integrity of the paper. Therefore, <em>Science</em> has removed the Editorial Expression of Concern and posted this notification in its place to indicate the editors’ confidence in the Research Article’s data and conclusions. We thank the community for bringing these issues to our attention.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corrected version of the paper now includes GmNIN expression data in figure 5, and updates to the supplementary materials.</p>



<p>Neither of the two corresponding authors of the article, Shiyong Sun and Xuelu Wang of the State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Adaptation and Improvement at Henan University in Kaifeng, China, have responded to our request for comment. </p>



<p>Last week, <em>Science Advances </em>published an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj8941">expression of concern</a> after the authors of the article “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg3758">Unemployment and underemployment are causes of suicide</a>” notified the journal “of a quantitative error in their reporting of summary statistics” that they said did not affect their results or overall conclusions. The notice stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors regret this error and apologize to the community. <em>Science Advances</em> is examining the details of this issue and will proceed with a response as soon as sufficient information has been obtained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response from <em>Science</em> and its sister journal in these cases stands in stark contrast to the flagship publication’s failure to publish corrections to two of Marc Tessier-Lavigne’s articles that the neuroscientist and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/19/marc-tessier-lavigne-stanford-president-resignation/">former president of Stanford University</a> had submitted in 2015. “We regret this error,” Holden Thorp, editor in chief of <em>Science</em>, said in a <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/stanford-investigates-potential-misconduct-president-s-research">statement</a> to the journal’s editorially independent news division.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A journal spokesperson told us: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Science</em> has been consistently more aggressive about correcting the record, where needed, in recent years. We take related matters very seriously and communicate such updates to reporters via the embargoed <em>Science</em> Press Package, to readers in our print and online issues, and via social media, to spread the word as widely as possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog is derived from remarks that I gave earlier this year at the <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1k/k1kqbeixsy">UN Open Science Conference</a> (fast forward to minute 31 to begin watching). This is the final blog in a series of posts on how we can collectively change scholarly publishing for the benefit of all of us. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/the-pandemic-showed-scholarly-publishing-a-better-path-forward/">part one</a>, I outlined the challenges we need to overcome to affect change. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/open-science-takes-people-willing-to-disrupt-the-system-to-move-it-forward/">part two</a>, I highlighted how shifting to Open Science practices can have meaningful and long-lasting impact. In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/06/moving-beyond-the-apc-to-make-scholarly-publishing-more-equitable/">part three</a>, I discussed how institutional business models can also affect equitable change at scale.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>So where do we go from here? What&rsquo;s required of publishers to accelerate the transition to Open Science and change the landscape for the good of all of us?</p>



<p>Back in the early days of the pandemic&ndash; which now feels like a lifetime ago &ndash; I remember being deeply moved by Arundhati Roy&rsquo;s piece <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca">The Pandemic is a Portal</a> about the impact of the pandemic in India. Towards the end, she notes that &ldquo;&hellip;in the midst of this terrible despair, [this moment] offers us a chance to rethink the doomsday machine we have built for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>



<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that this same imperative applies to scientific publishing. I don&rsquo;t think that evolutionary change will get us to where we need to be fast enough. At the STM Conference in Frankfurt last October, even a panel of CEOs from the biggest publishers agreed that scholarly publishing hadn&rsquo;t changed that much.</p>



<p>While I&rsquo;m enormously proud of what PLOS has achieved in its first 23 years, our role is fundamentally that of a catalyst and so we&rsquo;re nowhere near done.</p>



<p>To inform our next leap forward, we&rsquo;ve been in deep conversation over recent months with four key groups: researchers, senior university administrators, librarians, and funders. While we&rsquo;ve heard support for much work done by publishers, we&rsquo;vealso heard convergence on what&rsquo;s failing and frustration at the lack of disruption.</p>



<p>One of our roles has always been to demonstrate what&rsquo;s possible and so that&rsquo;s again where our focus is now shifting. We have a vision for a radical reframing of research sharing, built on the principles of Open Science, based on rigor, openness, and equity.</p>



<p>That vision is something we&rsquo;re now making concrete as we create a new way of sharing research. This will shift us away from the final article being the sole center of attention to one of a series of research objects, shared and appropriately assessed at different points in the research lifecycle. One that demonstrates that the article doesn&rsquo;t have to be immutable but that conclusions may shift over time. And one in which peer review evolves into less of a binary accept/reject decision to a more nuanced assessment.</p>



<p>There are a growing number of other innovators alongside us. But not enough. Our industry must embrace more radical change and let go of its own distorting incentives, those of profits and prestige.</p>



<p><strong>Call to Action</strong></p>



<p>And so as with all good experiments, the one we&rsquo;ve lived these past few years will only be useful if we learn something and change as a result. We&rsquo;ve all seen what&rsquo;s possible. And we know what&rsquo;s at stake. Now is the time to capitalize on this progress, to deepen interconnection, to align infrastructure and policies. We know that Open Science is the most effective way to tackle our common global challenges.</p>



<p>And so, I&rsquo;d like to leave you with a question: as a publisher, funder, scientist, or policymaker, what steps can you each take to move us forward?</p>



<p>Publishers have both an opportunity and a responsibility to act now, but we all share that responsibility. Everyone is this ecosystem is a crucial partner in the ambitions that I&rsquo;ve outlined in this series of blogs posts. If each of us is willing to take one disruptive step, we can ensure the pandemic&rsquo;s legacy is a reminder not just of what science can do, but also of how science should be done.</p>

<p>The journal <em>BMC Public Health</em> plans to retract an article that found smoking rates fell faster than expected in the US as use of e-cigarettes increased, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p>The authors contend that they addressed the issues cited in the retraction notice during the peer review process and say they addressed them even more extensively when the journal said they intended to retract.</p>



<p>The paper, “<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z">Population-level counterfactual trend modelling to examine the relationship between smoking prevalence and e-cigarette use among US adults</a>,” was published last October. The authors are all employees of Pinney Associates, a consulting firm that they disclosed “provide[s] consulting services on tobacco harm reduction on an exclusive basis to Juul Labs Inc.” The article also disclosed that Juul Labs funded the research and reviewed and provided comments on a draft manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some journals, including several in the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5193">BMJ family</a> and the <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306916">American Journal of Public Health</a>, will not publish research funded by the tobacco industry, which has led to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/30/bmj-journal-retracts-e-cigarette-paper-after-authors-disclose-tobacco-industry-funding-late-in-the-process/">at least one retraction</a>. But the planned BMC Public Health retraction notice does not refer to that conflict of interest.</p>



<span id="more-127608"></span>



<p>An unpublished letter to the editor prompted the investigation that led to the journal’s retraction decision, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. The letter did not request retraction of the paper, but argued that its analyses “were flawed and therefore potentially produced misleading findings that would benefit tobacco industry profits and interests.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorena Verduci, an editor of <em>BMC Public Health</em>, shared the letter with the authors on May 24. She also included an assessment of the letter by an unnamed editorial board member who agreed with the critiques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among other critiques, the letter called out Juul’s support for the article, and that the analysis assumed the prevalence of e-cigarette use in the US was zero in 2010 and rose in a linear fashion until a CDC survey began gathering data on usage in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors’ filling in linear data points between 2010 and 2014 for their main analysis was “questionable,” the letter stated, and findings from an additional analysis that left out those filled-in values “are hidden in the manuscript.” Reading the paper’s supplementary materials, the letter said, revealed that “most estimated associations were no longer statistically significant” in that analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Floe Foxon, the original article’s corresponding author, sent the authors’ response on June 12.&nbsp;In their response, the authors highlight sensitivity tests they performed using 2009 and 2011 as alternative cutoff years, which they said “support the findings of the main analysis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper’s <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-14341-z/peer-review">peer review record</a>, which is available online, indicates that the authors added those sensitivity tests in a <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12889-022-14341-z/12889_2022_14341_AuthorComment_V3.pdf">revision</a> responding to reviewer feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors also wrote that the analysis leaving out the filled-in data:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>showed that the results of our main analyses were robust for the younger adult and male cohorts in these sensitivity tests. These are the cohorts with the highest e-cigarette use prevalence, and thus the most relevant to the research question. Contrary to the Letter, which claims that our results were not mentioned in text, the findings from this analysis are reported in the Results section of our manuscript under the subheading ‘Sensitivity test results.’ Thus, the allegation in the Letter that we “directed attention elsewhere” is simply untrue.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verduci, who has not responded to multiple requests for comment over the past week, informed Foxon on July 18 that the journal had decided to retract the article in light of the editorial board member’s assessment of the authors’ response. She included the assessment, which did not explicitly recommend retraction. However, the editorial board member wrote: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am not convinced that the authors’ response addresses the main issues and serious flaws raised by the authors of the Letter.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verduci proposed the following text for the retraction notice, and asked the authors if they agreed with it, giving them a deadline of July 25 to respond: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors have retracted this article after readers have raised concerns around the methodology. In particular, the paper&#8217;s conclusions are based on assumption of ‘0’ prevalence of e-cigarette use in 2010 which contradicts available data. Without this assumption, the results become non-significant.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Foxon replied on July 21 that the authors “object strenuously to the intention to retract our article.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reply included additional analyses using 2006, 2007, and 2008 as cutoff years when e-cigarette use was zero in the US, and offered to add them to the paper. The authors wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The fundamental finding remains: smoking is declining at a faster-than-expected rate, in a manner that correlates with the rise in e-cigarette prevalence. In fact, the correlation coefficients change little with these variations in cut-off years, which suggests that the findings are robust.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Foxon told us the email informing the authors of the retraction was “baffling.” He maintained that the authors had “thoroughly addressed” the criticisms, and said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It was not previously indicated that a retraction was on the table; the previous correspondence we received from the journal did not contain any accusation of fabrication, falsification, or anything else in the COPE guidelines that would warrant a retraction. We were asked to respond to concerns raised by an anonymous reader and an anonymous Editorial Board Member, but at that time there was no mention of an investigation into a retraction; we were never notified that such an investigation was taking place.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We asked what Foxon thought should happen instead of a retraction. He told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am a firm believer in open science, and that path would entail publishing both sides of the disagreement: the anonymous Letter to the Editor and the anonymous Editorial Board Member’s opinions, as well as our responses. That would allow interested readers to decide for themselves which conclusion best fits the available data. Retracting the paper does not afford readers this opportunity, and credits one side of a discussion while suppressing the other in a way that is incongruous with the pursuit of scientific knowledge. Readers may welcome seeing an analysis which the anonymous Letter-writer and Editorial Board Member believe is more correct. NHIS is a publicly-available dataset, and they have the same access to these data as we did.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-saddle-horseback-riding-china-grave">The oldest known horseback riding saddle was found in a grave in China</a></h4>

              
                <p>A woman buried more than 2,400 years ago in what’s now northwestern China has galloped into a scientific afterlife atop the earliest directly dated horseback riding saddle.</p>



<p>Researchers have radiocarbon dated the well-preserved, soft saddle to 727 B.C. to 396 B.C. Excavated at what’s known as the Yanghai cemetery, this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ara.2023.100451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertly crafted piece of riding equipment</a> is about as old as, or possibly older than, the previous record holders, archaeologist Patrick Wertmann of the University of Zurich and colleagues report in the September <em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>.</p>





<p>Soft saddles found in tombs of mobile herders and warriors from the Scythian Pazyryk culture of northern Asia date to 430 B.C. to 420 B.C. Those dates are inferred from analyses of tree rings in wood that was used to construct those chambers.</p>



<p>Despite its simple design, “the Yanghai saddle was manufactured by a specialist familiar not only with needle- and leatherwork but with horse riding and the anatomy of horse and rider,” Wertmann says. The finished product, which showed signs of extensive use, had been placed with the deceased woman’s body in a position for her to take another ride.</p>



<p>It shares basic features with present-day soft saddles, including two wing-shaped hides sewn together to form a seat, divided by a long, narrow strip of hide that was placed over a horse’s spine. Rounded pieces of hide attached to the front and back of the wing-shaped pieces would have helped riders to maintain an upright position and raise themselves up, say when shooting an arrow.</p>

Wertmann <em>et al</em>/<em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>, 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Different stitching techniques using either sinew or leather thread hold the Yanghai saddle together. Saddle stitching, a method still practiced today that creates two rows of interlocking threads using a single row of holes, connected front and back supports to the saddle seat. Simpler stitching methods were used to repair tears in the saddle and to close incisions in each main hide that could be opened to stuff animal hair and straw into the saddle seat for cushioning.</p>



<p>When and where people began to ride horses and use saddles remains uncertain. Yamnaya herders living in the area of modern Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yamnaya-worlds-earliest-horseback-riders">may have ridden horseback as early as around 5,000 years ago</a>,&nbsp;based on an analysis of the herders’ skeletal features (<em>SN: 3/3/23</em>). Ancient artwork from around 4,800 years ago in Mesopotamia shows horses being ridden without saddles, Wertmann says.</p>



<p>But only saddles provide clear evidence of horseback riding, says anthropological archaeologist Alicia Ventresca-Miller of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Subtle construction differences between the Yanghai saddle and others found at several regional sites, presumed to be of around the same age as the Yanghai find, “suggest that knowledge of saddle-making was being transferred between [communities] that then made variable types of saddles,” says Ventresca-Miller, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>At Yanghai, where 531 tombs have been excavated, researchers have recovered whips, bridles and other items associated with horseback riding that date to as early as around 3,300 years ago. Only one other grave aside from the woman’s tomb, thought to be of about the same age, has yielded a saddle. But that find is fragmentary and has not been radiocarbon dated.</p>



<p>Yanghai excavations have also produced the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pants-oldest-ancient-horseman-asia-culture-origin">oldest known pair of pants</a>, worn by a horseback rider around 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 2/18/22</em>).</p>



<p>Saddle-making emerged later, as riders became concerned with their own comfort and safety and the health of their horses, Wertmann suspects. Comfortable saddles would have enabled everyone in a community to ride horses and spurred increases in long-distance horseback trips, Ventresca-Miller says.</p>





<p>Wertmann’s team cannot say whether Yanghai people, who lived in year-round settlements, or a mounted herding community from elsewhere in Central and East Asia made the ancient woman’s saddle. She may have migrated to Yanghai from a herding group and brought the saddle along. Or Yanghai people may have acquired the saddle through trade. Or local experts in leather and needlework may have crafted the saddle.</p>

<p>An alumna of the lab of <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/?s=carlo+croce">Carlo Croce</a>, a high-profile cancer researcher at The Ohio State University with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dCroce%252c%2bCarlo%2bM">14 retractions</a>, has sued the institution over the results of its investigation that found she committed research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flavia Pichiorri is now a principal investigator with <a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research/beckman-research-institute/hematologic-malignancies-translational-science/pichiorri-lab">her own lab</a> researching potential therapies for multiple myeloma at City of Hope – a cancer center that also owns Cancer Treatment Centers of America –&nbsp; in Duarte, Calif.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She worked at Ohio State from 2004-16, first as a postdoctoral researcher in Croce’s lab, then as a research scientist, and finally as an assistant professor of hematology. She has been a PI on grants that garnered <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/UElPzu9dME-YG2jg4sv2EA/projects?PI=10290216">millions of dollars</a> in funding from the National Institutes of Health since switching jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127597"></span>



<p>After Pichiorri left Ohio State, the university received allegations that some of her work contained fake data in the form of manipulated and reused images. A subsequent investigation, finalized in 2020, found that Pichiorri was responsible for the faked data in four publications, one of which was a correction, spanning from her time in Croce’s lab through her establishing her own lab at Ohio State. <em>Nature</em> reported the university’s findings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02002-5">last year</a>, calling them one of “the first determinations of research misconduct relating to work done in Croce’s lab.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Pichiorri is suing her former employer, alleging in <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pichiorri-complaint.pdf">her complaint</a> that the investigation was “flawed,” the findings “invalid,” and the issues identified in her work the result of “honest error.” She further alleges that the university’s investigation and requests that journals retract her papers with fake data violated her rights to due process, and that the publication of the final report defamed her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Croce has filed several lawsuits unsuccessfully, and now owes his attorneys <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/judge-orders-cancer-researchers-art-collection-seized-to-pay-fees-from-failed-libel-suit/">well over $1 million</a>.</p>



<p>Among Pichiorri’s demands: that Ohio State retract its investigation report, no longer keep it on file, and revise its findings to be “consistent with federal research misconduct standards and evidence presented by Plaintiff.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Ohio State told us the university “cannot comment on pending litigation.” Ohio State&nbsp; in a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OSU-motion-to-dismiss.pdf">court filing</a> asking for the suit to be dismissed with prejudice has disputed Pichiorri’s allegations and argued that federal regulation of research misconduct investigations preempts her claims.</p>



<p>Pichiorri declined to be interviewed and referred questions to her lawyers. We asked the lawyers, Renny J. Tyson and William W. Patmon III, both of Columbus, Ohio, to comment on the university’s arguments in its motion to dismiss the case. Tyson responded that Pichiorri “stands by the allegations in her complaint.”</p>



<p>Pichiorri’s suit names each member of the university’s “College of Medicine Investigation Committee” – officially referred to as “COMIC” – as well as the Ohio State Board of Trustees and the university’s Vice President of Research. She claims the members of the investigation committee “lacked the requisite expertise to review and evaluate research misconduct investigations,” and that Ohio State’s “failure to properly select, train and provide sufficient oversight” to the committee “resulted in a flawed investigation.”</p>



<p>The findings, the suit alleges, were “premised upon improper standards of review; and unevenly applied to Dr. Pichiorri, especially with respect to male researchers.”</p>



<p>The complaint elaborates:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Carlo Croce was the principal senior lead researcher overseeing all the findings in which image falsifications were found and no research misconduct finding was made against him, even though all the work was produced in the OSU laboratory controlled by him and Plaintiff and other PhD students and post-doctoral researchers were supervised by him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pichiorri further describes the conditions in Croce’s lab:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Dr. Pichiorri and other OSU researchers at the time were not trained, were left unsupervised, without computers connected to OSU servers or standard of procedures to save or record the data, required to work long days and nights under strenuous conditions and treated as cheap labor to perform the bottom rung work related to the manuscripts in order that OSU and Dr. Croce, the party primarily responsible for the research, could continue to receive grants and grant monies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the problems in Dr. Croce&#8217;s laboratory, of which OSU and the COMIC were aware, the COMIC ignored those problems and assigned fault for the laboratory failings to Dr. Pichiorri.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In her complaint, Pichiorri maintains she “followed all procedures, protocols and standards of practice with regard to her work.” Other co-authors were responsible for the data and figures in question, she alleges, and “there was no evidence she was not diligent as a co-author.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast, the investigation committee’s report, <a href="https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-022-02002-5/23294232">published by <em>Nature</em></a>, had concluded that responsibility for the integrity of the images “should lie with the individual assembling the figures, which by her own admissions, is Dr. Pichiorri.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the course of the investigation, Pichiorri submitted what she said were original data from the experiments that formed the basis for the figures. The committee, she alleges, should have viewed this data and the formal corrections she had already made to some figures in the published papers “as evidence of honest error.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pichiorri also claims the number of questionable figures – eight, four of which were corrected before the investigation began – indicates the irregularities were the result of honest error. Her complaint states that the U.S. Office of Research Integrity, which oversees research misconduct investigations:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>has historically determined that research misconduct accusations are typically the result of honest error where, as in the instant case, only a few images and data are involved. Where ORI has found research misconduct, it has only found actual research misconduct in cases where the mean number of falsified or fabricated data involved an average sixty-two (62) images within a range of minimum twelve (12) to one hundred eighty-nine (189) images.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In its review of the data and explanations Pichiorri submitted, the investigation committee concluded:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>none of Dr. Pichiorri&#8217;s current arguments justify how an image would be altered by stretching, flipping or inverting.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pichiorri alleges that her “career and professional reputation have suffered irreparable, grave injury” because Ohio State’s “improper and errant findings of misconduct and the publication of such erroneous findings that have placed Dr. Pichiorri in a false light and irreparably damaged her reputation in the scientific community.”</p>



<p>She claims in her complaint that after <em>Nature</em>’s story publicized Ohio State’s finding, she was removed from an NIH panel she had served on for seven years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also alleges that Ohio State contacted City of Hope with its findings and requested the cancer center investigate all of her NIH-funded work. The second investigation found she had “not engaged in any research misconduct,” according to the complaint, “but the damage was already done.” Pichiorri was left feeling “diminished in her role as a senior leader,” and a member of her staff “allegedly resigned due to the accusations.”</p>



<p>The Ohio State investigation committee recommended that two of Pichiorri’s papers should be retracted and another corrected. Of the two articles recommended for retraction, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610822004974">one</a> has been pulled and the other marked with an <a href="https://rupress.org/jem/article/219/11/e2012095009272022e/213516/Expression-of-Concern-In-vivo-NCL-targeting">expression of concern</a>. The <a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/5290/text/">article</a> the committee wanted corrected does not appear to have been updated. Two other papers on which Pichiorri was a co-author have been <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dFlavia%2bPichiorri">retracted</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sport-supplements-ingredients-dietary">Many sports supplements have no trace of their key ingredients</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fat incinerator. Metabolism booster. Thermo activator. Some over-the-counter sports supplements advertise ingredients with purported performance-enhancing properties, but it’s anyone’s guess what’s really in that pill or powder.</p>



<p>Just <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 percent of nearly 60 tested dietary supplements</a> actually contain an accurate amount of key ingredients listed on the label, scientists report July 17 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>. Forty percent did not contain a detectable amount of the ingredients at all.</p>



<p>“I just had to shake my head,” says Pieter Cohen, a primary care doctor at Cambridge Health Alliance in Somerville, Mass. “It’s incredible that in 40 percent of the products, the manufacturer doesn’t even bother putting any [of the ingredient] in.”</p>





<p>Cohen and his colleagues chemically analyzed 57 sports supplements with labels that listed <em>R. vomitoria</em>, methylliberine, halostachine, octopamine or turkesterone — plants or plant compounds that could potentially serve as stimulants or muscle-builders. Only 34 contained the ingredient claimed. Six had about the right amount; 28 had inaccurate amounts that varied wildly, from 0.02 percent to 334 percent of the quantity indicated on the label.</p>



<p>“That’s alarming,” says Luis Rustveld, a dietician and epidemiologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who was not involved with the work. Some people may be very sensitive to these ingredients he says, and “they may be getting a whole lot more than they thought.”</p>



<p>Cohen’s team also found that seven of the products tested contained at least one compound prohibited by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In past years, scientists have identified hundreds of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hundreds-dietary-supplements-tainted-potentially-harmful-drugs">supplements tainted with potentially harmful drugs</a> <em>(SN: 10/12/18).</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike prescribed drugs, the FDA does not have the authority to approve dietary supplements before they hit grocery store shelves. But the agency requires that supplements do at least contain the ingredients they list on their label, Cohen says.</p>



<p>Just because a supplement is on the market does not mean it’s safe, effective or contains what it advertises, says Patricia Deuster, a nutrition specialist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md., who did not participate in the new research. “It is virtually impossible for the average person … to make informed decisions about purchasing supplements without outside assistance.”</p>



<p>Third-party organizations like NSF, BSCG and USP can be helpful, she says, because they analyze supplements and offer their stamp of approval. And an <a href="https://www.opss.org/opss-scorecard-check-your-dietary-supplement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online scorecard</a> developed by the U.S. Department of Defense can also help consumers evaluate their supplements, Deuster says.</p>



<p>When deciding what and whether to buy, Cohen cautions, “you should use the utmost skepticism.” Rustveld agrees. “Whenever you see claims like, ‘You’re going to burn fat’, or ‘You’re going to improve your performance,’” he says, “if it sounds too good to be true, it’s probably not true.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-intense-sunlight-earth-atacama-desert">The most intense sunlight on Earth can be found in the Atacama Desert</a></h4>

              
                <p>Forget Arizona or Florida — sun worshippers ought to head to the Atacama Desert in South America. It&#8217;s there that <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/104/6/BAMS-D-22-0215.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sun&#8217;s rays on Earth are most intense</a>, beating out places like Mount Everest and even, occasionally, rivaling the conditions on Venus, researchers report July 3 in the <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</em>.</p>



<p>Satellite data have suggested that the Altiplano — a high-altitude plateau in the Atacama that straddles parts of Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Argentina — experiences the most intense levels of sunlight on Earth. But since satellites look down on our planet’s surface from afar, it’s important to verify that claim with on-the-ground data, says Raúl Cordero, a physicist at the University of Santiago in Chile. “How good are these estimates?”</p>



<p>To answer that question, Cordero and colleagues set up a small atmospheric observatory, housed in two shipping containers, in the Chilean Altiplano. Since 2016, the researchers have been measuring solar radiation levels at the site using a pyranometer, a palm-sized instrument sensitive to ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared light.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072123_kk_solar_radiation_inline.jpg" alt="A photo of a researcher working high in the Andes Mountains of Chile sets up an instrument to measure solar radiation." class="wp-image-3129903" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072123_kk_solar_radiation_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072123_kk_solar_radiation_inline-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072123_kk_solar_radiation_inline-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/072123_kk_solar_radiation_inline-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129903">A researcher working high in the Andes Mountains of Chile sets up an instrument to measure solar radiation.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129903">R. Cordero</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on the first five years of data from the observatory, the average amount of solar power hitting each square meter of the landscape — 308 watts — is consistent with the earlier satellite observations and even higher than values <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/101/11/bamsD190198.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded by a pyranometer near the summit of Mount Everest</a>, the team reports.</p>



<p>The researchers also captured bursts of extremely intense solar radiation. One event, in January 2017, blasted the site with 2,177 watts per square meter — more than seven times the average. The intensity of that burst and others like it rivals <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-will-it-take-go-venus">solar radiation on Venus</a>, which is over 40 million kilometers closer to the sun than Earth is (<em>SN: 2/13/18</em>). Such events, which typically last just a few minutes, are caused by thin clouds scattering light toward the ground, the researchers suggest.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-driver-ants-africa-ecology">Some African birds follow nomadic ants to their next meal</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>COIMBATORE, India</strong> — To better understand Equatorial Guinea’s tropical birds, ornithologists Luke L. Powell and Patricia Rodrigues scan the ground rather than the trees. They are searching for nests of driver ants (<em>Dorylus</em> spp.). These voracious predators will march out of their underground nests and fan out into a meters-wide swarm, flushing out insects and worms from undergrowth. From the trees, birds swoop down to catch the fleeing insects. And where the ant swarms go, the birds follow.</p>



<p>Swarms make humming and “tick tick tick” sounds, says Powell, of the University of Porto in Portugal. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-ants-squeak">It is the sound of the ants</a> — and of animals scurrying in panic (<em>SN: 8/12/02</em>). “Then you hear the sounds of birds chirping at the edge [of the swarm], communicating.”</p>





<p>Ant-following birds are well studied in the neotropical Americas. In Africa, however, “people have seen birds follow ants, but nobody has really looked” to see whether the animals have a specialized relationship, says Rodrigues from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.</p>



<p>The first step to figuring that out is finding driver ant nests. Since 2020, Rodrigues has spent weeks at a time scrutinizing the ground for ants in a forest near Ciudad de la Paz. When she finds them, she knows to keep her distance. “They’re super-duper aggressive and they have giant mandibles that can pierce your skin,” Rodrigues says. Despite her caution, ant bites “inevitably happen”— sometimes the ants fall out of trees onto her and her colleagues.</p>



<p>Rodrigues follows the ants as they carry food back to their nests. Since driver ants are nomadic, often relocating their colonies, she checks every nest daily in case the colony starts to move. “We do a lot of walking around the block,” she says with a laugh.</p>



<p>For their latest study, Rodrigues, Powell and colleagues placed cameras at the entrances of seven&nbsp;driver ant nests and recorded about 80 hours of footage. “Birds come up to a nest entrance and check it out,” says Powell, leaning his body forward and turning his head left and right, imitating a bird, “and fly into the direction of where the ants are raiding that day.”</p>

Rodrigues</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When the team played calls of ant-following birds like the white-tailed ant thrush (<em>Neocossyphus poensis</em>) and fire-crested alethe (<em>Alethe castanea</em>), it attracted about 30 other bird species. Many of these birds eat insects and could be homing in on the calls of specialized ant-following birds for food, the researchers say.&nbsp; In contrast, only seven bird species responded to calls of the African green pigeon (<em>Treron calvus</em>), which does not follow ants.</p>



<p>What’s more, early results from a GPS monitoring experiment suggest that <a href="https://www.xcdsystem.com/atbc/program/PlxWxeL/index.cfm?pgid=2748&amp;sid=23991&amp;abid=121645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ant-following birds have larger home ranges</a> than the average understory bird. The scientists think this is because the birds have to fly farther to survey the moving ant colonies, Powell said July 6 at a meeting of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.</p>



<p>These newly documented behaviors in African tropical birds show they are more specialized on driver ants than researchers had expected, Rodrigues says. The team now wants to examine how this specialization affects the birds when forest degradation changes the numbers and distribution of driver ants. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous studies in <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cameroon</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.13014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equatorial Guinea</a> have shown that forest degradation drastically reduces the populations of insectivorous birds, especially the ones that follow ants. Because driver ants avoid hot, open spaces, Powell and Rodrigues wonder if that might explain why these birds are particularly vulnerable to forest loss.</p>



<p>The team’s work “is essential to inform decision makers and ideally have an impact on regulations for deforestation and land-use change in countries with growing agriculture, such as Equatorial Guinea,” says Carolina Ocampo-Ariza, an ecologist at the University of Göttingen in Germany who has reported on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S143917911830272X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact of forest loss on ant-following birds in Cameroon</a>. Forest degradation would remove the mix of trees and shrubs that the birds need to “stand on and effectively catch prey and follow the ants,” she says.</p>





<p>Because ant-following birds are relatively easy to find, not hunted, and sensitive to forest disturbance, Powell says they could indicate which forests to protect and how. Studying the birds and their relationship with driver ants is akin to “keeping your finger on the pulse of forest health,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-heat-wave-summer">Here’s how much climate change increases the odds of brutally hot summers</a></h4>

              
                <p>The recent, record-breaking heat waves that have scorched the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, China and southern Europe were made <a href="https://doi.org/10.25561/105549" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatically more likely</a> due to human-caused climate change, researchers report July 25 in a study from the World Weather Attribution network.</p>



<p>“This is absolutely not a surprise,” climate scientist Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said at a July 24 news briefing. But “while the weather is changing as expected, how much it hurts us is larger than expected.”</p>





<p>These intense and at times deadly heat waves are occurring as high-pressure systems stall across the Northern Hemisphere, creating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/summer-extreme-heat-waves-jet-stream">barely budging heat domes</a> (<em>SN: 7/19/23</em>). &nbsp;Phoenix, for example, has reached at least 43.3° C (110° Fahrenheit) every day for more than three weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Otto and her colleagues used computers to simulate Earth’s climate, with and without human-caused climate change, to assess how likely the recent heat waves would have been under different climate conditions.</p>



<p>In a world without climate change, they found, the recent extreme heat in China would be expected roughly once every 250 years. Now, it’s a once-in-five-years phenomenon, or 50 times more likely to occur. Meanwhile the extreme heat waves in southern Europe and North America, which would have been virtually impossible without climate change, are now likely to occur once every 10 years and 15 years, respectively.</p>



<p>Should climate warming reach 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, these events could occur every two to five years, the simulations showed. We’ve already warmed by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-weather-climate-change-2022">at least 1.1 degrees C</a> since then (<em>SN: 12/22/22</em>).</p>



<p>Though it’s still too early to pin down the human toll of these extreme events, hundreds of deaths have already been reported from regions around the world, and power shortage concerns grow as the demand for cooling surges.</p>



<p>“The risks are rising faster than we are adapting,” Otto said. “We are much more vulnerable than we might have liked to believe in the past.”</p>

<p>Hyperprolific authors have been drawing attention for some time. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/09/12/when-it-comes-to-authorship-how-prolific-is-too-prolific/">In 2018</a>, for example, a <em>Nature</em> article reported that “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06185-8">thousands of scientists have published a paper every five days</a>.” And earlier this year <em>El Pais</em> noted that a now-suspended scientist <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-04-02/one-of-the-worlds-most-cited-scientists-rafael-luque-suspended-without-pay-for-13-years.html">was publishing a paper every 37 hours</a>.</p>



<p>What about an author who publishes more than once a day, on average?</p>



<p>Viroj Wiwanitkit has published <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Wiwanitkit%20V&amp;filter=datesearch.y_1">543 items indexed in PubMed</a> in the last 12 months, the vast majority of them letters to the editor. Most of Wiwanitkit’s letters with colleagues appear to be only a single paragraph. Many concern <a href="http://dx.doi.org/0.1016/j.wneu.2022.12.059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 and vaccinations</a>, but the catalog includes letters about <a href="http://dx.doi.org/0.1007/5584_2022_741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monkeypox</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00590-021-03193-9">knee replacement surgery</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17712/nsj.2023.1.20220122">bipolar disorder</a>, even <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2023-003864">ChatGPT</a>.</p>



<span id="more-127585"></span>



<p>To be clear, most definitions of hyperprolific authors exclude such work. But the volume seemed noteworthy. We asked Wiwanitkit, now an adjunct professor at Joseph Ayobabalola University in Nigeria, some questions over the course of several emails. Below is an edited version; we have made the entire exchange available <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wiwanitkit-interview.pdf">here</a>. We have not made spelling or grammatical changes anywhere in either version. (And a researcher who flagged a May 2020 correction of a paper by Wiwanitkit reminds us of a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/05/22/what-it-takes-to-correct-the-record-autopsy-of-a-covid-19-corrigendum/">guest post he wrote for us about the episode</a>.)</p>



<p><strong>How do you explain your productivity?</strong></p>



<p>For the profilic work, I have collaboration with several other profilic authors and I take role in supervision in most cases. The type of article that our group work is usually on scientific letter to editor, which is a standard type of article in scientific journal. Our group focus to work and publish only in a standard non predatory (non-paid) journal with international indexing. For sure, the article has to pas the scientific peer review and checking for code of conduct by the academic publisher.</p>



<p>A way to produce the scientific work has to start with a good ideas, plan and work on the academic plan. As I am also journal editor for many journals, therefore, I usually get communicate by some academic practitioner for collaboration.</p>



<p>You are not the first one who ask how to produce many publications and I reply a simple concept that you have to create, idea, make a plan and practice to get experience that you can have experience in working and writing. Also, I usually teach my junior to follow the code of conduct and it is an important that if you do not follow the good code of conduct , you will not gain your own creative ideas and experience to do any work</p>



<p>I have work for more than 30 years, starting from a poor developing countries. At early stage, I wrote many article sand rejected (more than one thousand draft article that I submit during my early academic practice and was rejected).</p>



<p>If you have loss an attempt, you will not get to the target. Experience and succcess will be soon if you still walk. Without walking , you cannot reach the target. I take 4 hours every day for working and writing. Though there might be a lot of work, I use the time in the night to work. That&#8217;s all.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you focus on indexed journals?</strong></p>



<p>Indexed journal is a standard journal platform in academic society.</p>



<p>Gray journal and predatory journal is not good. I think you understand.</p>



<p><strong>Do you benefit financially or otherwise from publishing these letters?</strong></p>



<p>I have never receive any money from writing those works.</p>



<p>Academic work is by willingness. I also have ever advice some of my junior who try to make money from working in incorrect way such as ghost writing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Are you concerned that this volume of work leads to superficial letters?</strong></p>



<p>Superficial or not depends on the view of readers. Any work go on routine academic peer reviewing process and ethical code of conduct.</p>



<p>Small or large piece of work is not important in my though. Ideas is more important</p>



<p>Have you ever heard and remembered the story of one piece of paper of famous scientific rule written by Einstein. A long article with non sense and poor idea content is not uncommon and many authors use predatory (paid) journal to be their portal for publication, which I totally not agree for that idea.</p>



<p>in Asian, we have idiom &#8220;have a quater first then you will get the complete whole one&#8221;</p>



<p>If you rely on only large long thing and devalue of the short message, there will not be scientific progression.</p>



<p>Another point that I do not publish long work since I already notify that there is no money to support my team academic work.</p>



<p>At present, I usually act as supervisor to my junior colleage and most of them are from poor Asian countries and have no mney to pay for the expensive publication charge so they usually write a short piece of work to correspond and manage the problem of publication charge.</p>



<p>Publishing short scientific letter usually cost me and may team no charge. Perhaps, if there is any financial support externally, a longer article might be focused (maybe, in your setting, USA??, there might be funding to support those junior authors who have willingness to do the academic work).</p>



<p>One who publish few works might publish either good or non sense work or ethical or non ethical work. This is the same for the high profilic author as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last, as I told do not count on other work. Counting on number of other work can let you feel fatique and loss of hope to reach the target. In some cases, a bad person might feel jealous and thing bad when he/she see the other has more success. This is an important take home message that I usually teach my junior.</p>



<p><strong>Any summary thoughts?</strong></p>



<p>[I] would like to let take home message for any beginner that 1. If you do not walk, you will not reach the target.&nbsp; 2. Rome does not built in one day!&nbsp; 3. Do a good thing by your own first. God will not help anyone who do not help his/her own self. &nbsp; 4. Do not count on other success but look to improve your ownself. Don&#8217;t waste time, everything has to start from 0 before it reach the infinity.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/07/open-science-by-discipline/">How does Open Science practice differ between research disciplines?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Written by </em><a href="mailto:lcadwallader@plos.org"><em>Lauren Cadwallader</em></a><em> and </em><a href="mailto:linds.morton@gmail.com"><em>Lindsay Morton</em></a></p>



<p>Different research communities have different priorities, needs, norms, and challenges in communicating their research&mdash;it&rsquo;s no surprise, therefore, that adoption of Open Science practices also differs across topics and disciplines. Open Science Indicators (OSIs) illuminate patterns in Open Science adoption across disciplines in a way that hasn&rsquo;t been possible before. We&rsquo;re excited to share preliminary observations on disciplinary differences in the adoption of Open Science practices based on the most recent <a href="https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/PLOS_Open_Science_Indicators/21687686">OSI dataset</a>.</p>



<h2>About this analysis</h2>



<p>Open Science Indicators (OSIs) use Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence to identify and quantify Open Science practices. The most recent dataset encompasses all 74,130 PLOS research articles published between January 1 2019 and March 31 2023 and a comparator set of 8,186 Open Access articles drawn from PMC. The Open Science practices measured are data sharing, code sharing, and preprint posting.</p>



<p>The OSI dataset includes the DOI of every article analyzed, making it easy to match against the range of taxonomies in use at indexing and archiving services that capture disciplinary data. For this analysis, we&rsquo;ve chosen the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/classifications/australian-and-new-zealand-standard-research-classification-anzsrc/latest-release">Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC)</a> taxonomy, as applied to Dimensions data, because it is an Open classification system and so can be extracted and recreated easily.</p>



<p>A single paper may fit within more than one topic definition, and so may be counted more than once in the analysis that follows.</p>



<h2>Data repository use</h2>



<p><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">Data</a> shared in any format has value, but for maximum discoverability, access, and utility, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/10/data-repository/">data repositories are considered the gold standard</a>. We focus our analysis on repository use, but rates of data sharing broadly may be calculated from the OSI dataset as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data repository use varies widely, both across disciplines, and between PLOS and comparator articles within the same discipline. For PLOS articles, the disciplines with the lowest rates of data repository use are Health Sciences (19% for PLOS, 6% for comparators) and Biomedical &amp; Clinical Sciences (19% for PLOS, 10% for comparators)&mdash;both fields likely to be affected by privacy considerations. Among the other disciplines with below average rates of repository usage are Engineering, Agriculture, and Earth Sciences, where proprietary data is common. The comparator dataset shows similar but not identical results, with Engineering (5%) and Health Sciences (6%) having the lowest adoption rates.</p>



<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum are Information &amp; Computing Sciences, Psychology, and Biological Sciences. The high rate of adoption in the Biological Sciences, and the similarity between the PLOS and comparator rates in the field, suggests a combination of disciplinary norms and mandated data deposition requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we examine the types of repositories used most often by discipline, Biological Sciences, Agriculture, and Biomedical &amp; Clinical Sciences are most likely to use a specialist repository with a more narrow discipline-specific scope&mdash;again probably influenced by mandated deposition for sequencing, genetic, crystallography, and macromolecular data.</p>

<h2>Code sharing</h2>



<p>Augmenting a research article with publicly available <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-code/">code</a> enhances understanding, facilitates reproducibility and reanalysis, promotes trust, and saves other researchers time and effort.</p>



<p>Interestingly, code generation does not appear to have a strong relationship with code sharing. In topic areas with high rates of code generation, code-sharing rates were widely distributed. For example, Mathematics, Information and Computing Sciences, and the Physical Sciences exhibit higher rates of both code generation and sharing, while the Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences, and Chemical Sciences had equally high rates of code generation, but&nbsp; much lower rates of code sharing. </p>



<p>Instead, code-sharing behavior appears highly correlated with data shared in a repository, suggesting that established data-sharing norms (<em>not</em> the prevalence/relevance of code) are the deciding factor.</p>

<h2>Preprint posting</h2>



<p><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">Preprints</a> empower researchers to take more control over their scientific communications, sharing early in order to establish priority, broadcast results, seek community feedback, increase readership, and bolster grant, job or tenure applications.</p>



<p>We explored preprint posting patterns over time and by region as part of our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/open-science-indicators/#preprints">2022 year-end analysis</a>. Parsing the data by discipline shows that the Biological Sciences display the highest rates of preprint posting for both the PLOS and comparator cohorts. This makes sense, given that biology is one of the largest topic areas published at PLOS, and biology preprint server bioRxiv was our first official partner server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS has also established preprint server partnerships in the Biomedical and Clinical Sciences with medRxiv, and more recently the Earth and Environmental Sciences, with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/01/eartharxiv-live/">EarthArXiv</a>&mdash;both topic areas where PLOS publishes relatively high volumes of papers. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that in the Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, preprint rates across PLOS and comparator articles are very similar. This parity may indicate, for example, that the convenience of facilitated posting&nbsp; less strongly influences the decision to preprint in this discipline. In Earth and Environmental Sciences, rates are generally lower than portfolio average, and vary by subdiscipline relative to comparators. Other future avenues of exploration might include investigation into the most popular servers by discipline, as well as when preprints are posted relative to journal submission date.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-telescope-stars-dark-matter">The James Webb telescope may have spotted stars powered by dark matter</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has spotted objects in the early universe that might be a new kind of star — one powered by dark matter.</p>



<p>These “dark stars” are still hypothetical. Their identification in JWST images is far from certain. But if any of the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2305762120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three candidates</a> — reported in the July 25 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> — turn out to be this new type of star, they could offer a glimpse of star formation in the early universe, hint at the nature of dark matter and possibly explain the origins of supermassive black holes.</p>





<p>First proposed in 2007 by cosmologist Katherine Freese and colleagues, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twinkle-twinkle-dark-matter-may-have-lit-first-stars">dark stars might have been some of the first types of stars</a> to form in the universe (<em>SN: 1/1/08</em>). Though dark stars have yet to be observed, they’re thought to be powered by heat from dark matter interactions rather than by nuclear fusion reactions like in the sun.</p>



<p>Dark stars “would be very weird looking,” says Freese, of the University of Texas at Austin. The hypothetical stars would have formed from clouds of hydrogen and helium that drew in locally abundant dark matter as they coalesced. Though the true nature of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics">dark matter</a> isn’t known — its presence is inferred largely via its effect on how stars move within galaxies — it’s possible that dark matter particles can interact with themselves, annihilating each other when they collide and producing vast amounts of light and heat (<em>SN: 7/7/22</em>). That heat would keep the cloud of hydrogen and helium from condensing into a dense, hot core like the stars that exist today.</p>



<p>Because the heat from dark matter annihilations would keep the gas cloud from condensing, dark stars could grow to gargantuan size. Theoretically, dark stars could be 10 times as wide as Earth’s orbit around the sun. They could also be millions of times as massive as the sun and shine billions of times brighter — bright enough, potentially, to be spotted by JWST.</p>



<p>To see if any dark stars are lurking in data from the orbiting observatory, Freese and colleagues pored over images from a JWST survey of early galaxies. In such images, JWST has so far discovered over 700 objects that may have originated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-time-galaxy">in the first few hundred million years of the universe</a> — the epoch when dark stars would have emerged (<em>SN: 12/16/22</em>). Light from these remote objects is stretched, or redshifted, as the universe expands. So Freese and colleagues zeroed in on four objects already confirmed to be highly redshifted, making them some of the oldest objects seen to date.</p>



<p>Those objects are currently thought to be small galaxies from the universe’s relative infancy. But because they’re so far away, JWST can’t resolve them well enough to determine whether they’re actually galaxies or large, ultrabright stars, the researchers say.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="551" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline.jpg" alt="An image from the James Webb Space Telescope with an arrow pointing at JADES-GS-z13-0." class="wp-image-3129792" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline-473x383.jpg 473w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline-555x450.jpg 555w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071823_sw_dark-stars_inline-230x186.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129792">Three dark star candidates were identified from data collected by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. One of the candidates, JADES-GS-z13-0, is shown here (arrow).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129792">NASA, ESA, CSA, JADES Collaboration</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team ran computer simulations of how much light a hypothetical dark star might produce at various wavelengths. They compared those spectra to light from images collected by JWST at different wavelengths for each of the four objects. JWST data from three of those objects are consistent with the simulated dark star patterns, Freese and colleagues report.</p>



<p>Some scientists are skeptical. Known types of stars could also create the observed light from the three candidates, says Sandro Tacchella, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge. And identifying any of the objects as a dark star would require that the simulated patterns fit well to more detailed spectra, says Brant Robertson, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>



<p>If dark stars were to be found, though, “that would be revolutionary,” says study coauthor Cosmin Ilie, an astrophysicist at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y.</p>



<p>Detecting dark stars would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics">confirm the existence of a dark matter particle</a> and hint at how it works (<em>SN: 7/7/22</em>). “Just having the information that [dark matter] is something that could annihilate would be really, really powerful,” says Tracy Slatyer, a theoretical physicist at MIT who was not involved in the study. That knowledge could help scientists look for dark matter elsewhere in the universe, she says.</p>





<p>Dark stars could also help explain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-cant-figure-out-why-some-black-holes-got-so-big-so-fast">the formation of supermassive black holes</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/18</em>). Once the dark matter inside the star has annihilated itself, the remaining hydrogen and helium — millions of times the mass of the sun in a relatively compact space — would collapse in on itself and form a black hole. Those black holes could merge over time into black holes like the ones at the centers of most galaxies, millions or billions of times as massive as the sun.</p>



<p>Future experiments, like looking for brighter or dimmer light at certain wavelengths, could help confirm whether any of the three objects are dark stars. Freese also expects to find more dark star candidates in future JWST data, she says. But for now, whether dark stars truly exist remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-embryo-replica-complex-advanced">Human embryo replicas have gotten more complex. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some newly reported clumps of cells growing in lab dishes have been hailed as the closest things to human embryos that scientists have ever made in the lab.</p>



<p>These entities are human embryo models — masses of cells created from stem cells that mimic some properties of certain stages of embryo development. The achievement gives researchers a chance to look at human development beyond the first week or so, when an embryo must implant in the uterus to develop further. That post-implantation stage hadn’t been re-created in lab dishes — until now.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Six studies reported in June and July describe the embryo models, which have generated excitement and concern in equal measure.</p>



<p>For researchers working on these embryo models, the faux embryos are new tools to gain insight into the “black box” of human development, after embryos implant in the uterus. They are useful because donated human embryos are in short supply, and there are limits on the types of experiments researchers can perform on them.</p>



<p>About 60 percent of pregnancies fail just before, during or soon after implantation, developmental and stem cell biologist Magdalena Żernicka-Goetz of the University of Cambridge and Caltech said June 27 during a news briefing discussing an embryo model made in her lab. Insights gleaned from the embryo models may give new understanding of why many pregnancies fail to take hold and lead to better fertility treatments, Żernicka-Goetz said.</p>



<p>But others worry that the models — along with eggs and sperm made from stem cells — raise the specter of researchers using the mimics to create babies. Scientists developing the models say reproduction is not their aim or intention, and that implantation in a uterus is impossible with these embryo models.</p>



<p>Still, the research raises issues of how to — and whether to — regulate what scientists can do with embryo-like entities made from stem cells. Questions surround whether embryo models could or should be grown past the equivalent of 14 days of normal human development after fertilization. And critics warn that overstating what the models are or can do could risks damaging trust in science.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> talked to scientists and ethicists to learn more about these human embryo models.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What are human embryo models?</h4>



<p>Before answering that question, Amander Clark, president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, says we first need to understand that a human embryo is the product of fertilization of an egg and sperm.</p>



<p>Embryo models, on the other hand, self-assemble from pluripotent stem cells — ones that have the power to make nearly any type of cell in the body. “Therefore, embryo models do not meet the clinical, medical or scientific definition of an embryo because they do not originate from the product of fertilization by two gametes,” says Clark, a stem cell scientist, developmental biologist and geneticist at UCLA.</p>



<p>For years, scientists have studied the first week or so of human development using donated human embryos or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blastoid-stem-cells-fertility-research">embryo models</a> (<em>SN: 1/5/22</em>). From those, researchers learned a great deal about the formation of the ball of cells known as a blastocyst. Blastocysts have an outer layer of cells that will form the placenta and other support systems for the developing embryo, and an inner cluster of cells that will give rise to the body.</p>





<p>But it&#8217;s the next few weeks of life when the real action happens, says stem cell biologist and embryologist Jacob Hanna of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. Between day seven and about day 35 after fertilization is when the embryo builds all its organs. “It moves from a ball of cells to a structure that anybody on the street … would tell you, &#8216;This is an embryo.&#8217; And then the rest of the other eight months are just growth of the embryo,” he says.</p>



<p>Researchers have assembled embryo models that contain some, but not all, of the types of cells necessary for normal development. The newly reported embryo models mimic structures that would be found in an embryo that has implanted in a uterus, even though the mimics have nothing to implant into. The models are simulating a very specific window of embryo development: “the events that occur as an embryo implants, how the embryo self-assembles,&#8221; Clark says. &#8220;Then essentially they collapse.”</p>



<p>None of the models completely copy a real embryo, she says. For instance, none make a very good trophectoderm, the layer of cells that gives rise to the placenta later in development. That layer is important for an embryo to implant into the uterus, and it also sends signals that help the rest of the embryo develop properly.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How did the latest buzz about embryo models start?</h4>



<p>Post-implantation embryo models drew media attention when Żernicka-Goetz presented preliminary findings in the closing moments of a talk she gave June 13 in Boston at a meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research. The <em>Guardian</em> newspaper hailed the work as a breakthrough that created synthetic human embryos.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="680" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071323_ths_human-embryo_inline.jpg" alt="A human embryo model resembling rings of cells of varying colors, with bright green in the middle and orange (with the occasional magenta) in the outer rings" class="wp-image-3129911" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071323_ths_human-embryo_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071323_ths_human-embryo_inline-383x383.jpg 383w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071323_ths_human-embryo_inline-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071323_ths_human-embryo_inline-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071323_ths_human-embryo_inline-580x580.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/071323_ths_human-embryo_inline-214x214.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3129911">Magdalena Żernicka-Goetz’s lab created an embryo model with layers of cells (green) the researchers say resemble the part of an embryo that will form the body, surrounded by a layer (orange) mimicking yolk sac–forming cells, and some cells (purple) similar to ones that give rise to the placenta. Other researchers are skeptical of the claim.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3129911">University of Cambridge</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That characterization overstates the achievement, says Alfonso Martinez Arias, a developmental biologist at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. The work is not a breakthrough, but an incremental advance, and is far from re-creating an embryo, he says.</p>



<p>Żernicka-Goetz and colleagues genetically engineered human stem cells to resemble three types of cells necessary for embryo development: cells that mimic the important placenta-generating trophectoderm, cells that resemble ones that will form the yolk sac that feeds the embryo until the placenta takes over, and ones that form the epiblast — the cells inside the embryo that will develop into the body. The resulting balls of cells <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06368-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resemble some aspects of human embryos</a>, the team reported June 27 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>For instance, the trophectoderm layer forms on the outside of the embryo-like structure as it does in embryos. But it doesn’t make proteins typical for that layer when assembled in a 3-D structure, so it isn’t truly a placental precursor, coauthor Bailey Weatherbee of the University of Cambridge said during the news briefing. But the layer is necessary for the rest of the embryo model to assemble, suggesting it performs some of the functions of the trophectoderm, she said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How were other embryo models made?</h4>



<p>Like Żernicka-Goetz’s team, all the research groups started with human stem cells. Carefully controlling growing conditions and the numbers of certain types of cells added to the mix allowed the stem cells to grow into embryo-like structures. The models differ in the number of cell types they contain and in the features of real embryos they’re able to mimic.</p>



<p>One group of researchers coaxed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06354-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells to form embryo-like structures</a> with two tissue layers. That work, also described June 27 in <em>Nature</em>, didn’t use genetic manipulation or chemicals to induce the stem cells to form embryo-like structures. Instead, the researchers relied on stem cells’ ability to self-organize, says developmental biologist Berna Sozen of Yale School of Medicine.</p>



<p>The resulting model lacks the trophectoderm. When the researchers realized the tissue was missing, they thought its absence might tell them something about its importance, she says. “In the absence of these tissues you can see what will happen, what doesn&#8217;t happen, and then you [get] very strong scientific insights [about] why you need that tissue.”</p>



<p>Another effort by researchers in China and Michigan, described in a not-yet-peer reviewed preprint posted June 16 online at bioRxiv.org, is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.15.545180v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technically impressive</a>, Martinez Arias says. But it still lacks a placenta precursor layer.</p>



<p>Most recently, a team led by Jun Wu of the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas persuaded stem cells to form <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00794-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embryo-like entities</a> that span the rearrangement event called gastrulation, the researchers report July 20 in <em>Cell</em>. During gastrulation embryos go from hollow spheres of cells to multilayered structures that will give rise to organs and tissues that form the body.</p>



<p>These “peri-gastruloid” models made some tissues resembling those in the early nervous system and may help confirm the origins of cells that will give rise to eggs and sperm. These models also contain a yolk sac, but “our model is not a complete model,” Wu says. “We don&#8217;t have the placenta tissue.”</p>

Lui <em>et al</em>/<em>Cell</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Because the models lack the trophectoderm, the researchers had to add proteins to anchor and support the gastruloids so they could develop properly.</p>



<p>A team of researchers in China reported preliminary results of similar <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.28.546720v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gastruloids with yolk sacs</a> June 28 at bioRxiv.org. That team found that the chemical thalidomide alters formation of the tissue layers and interrupts development.</p>



<p>In the future, researchers might use such models to understand how chemicals from the environment could affect developing embryos, Wu says.</p>



<p>Martinez Arias and others have previously made gastruloids that could model development up to day 19 after fertilization, but those earlier models didn’t have yolk sacs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Are any of the embryo models major advances?</h4>



<p>Of this “gold rush” of embryo models, only two are real advances, Martinez Arias says: Wu’s gastruloids and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.14.544922v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;embryo models</a> made by Hanna’s group. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Hanna’s models described in a June 15 preprint posted at bioRxiv.org, have a reasonable facsimile of both a yolk sac and the placenta precursor, Martinez Arias says, and make structures with “uncanny” resemblance to those of embryos at 14 days of development.</p>



<p>The process to achieve an embryo model so closely resembling the real thing was a long one, Hanna says. His team first worked out how to grow mouse embryos past this developmental stage in lab dishes. Using mouse embryos as their “experimental compass,” the researchers then figured out how to assemble a mouse embryo model from stem cells. From there, the team used the tricks they’d learned to grow human stem cells in conditions that coaxed them to self-assemble into structures approximating post-implantation embryos.</p>



<p>The self-assembly bypassed the blastocyst stage and moved directly to something akin to a post-implantation embryo, his team found. “Maybe the embryo [models] are deficient because we don&#8217;t go to through the blastocyst [stage]. I don&#8217;t think so. But I can&#8217;t exclude it at the moment,” Hanna says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Can these embryo models result in babies?</h4>



<p>No, but that question always comes up.</p>



<p>Scientists are interested in technical and biological advances the new embryo models bring. But for most people, “it&#8217;s really the possibility that they could be used for reproduction that that draws the attention,” says Katie Hasson, associate director of the Center for Genetics and Society, a nonprofit social justice organization based in Berkeley, Calif.</p>



<p>It’s not possible to use these embryo models for reproduction, scientists say. “Not only is it illegal to put these late stage [embryo models] inside the uterus, but actually if I wanted to, or anyone wanted to, these structures can never implant,” Hanna says. Implantation happens only when embryos consist of one to 64 cells. These post-implantation models have moved beyond that stage. Biologically, he says, “it will never succeed.”</p>



<p>Wu agrees. “These models are not human embryos at all,” he says. “They are not able to generate any type of life. They are essentially just a cluster of cells.”</p>



<p>There are legal blocks to growing embryos in the lab past a certain stage as well. In the United Kingdom, the law forbids growing embryos past 14 days of development, the point at which the embryo turns on its body-building program. That limit was imposed shortly after in vitro fertilization became possible.</p>



<p>But some of these embryo models already resemble embryos at the 14-day stage of development. Since the models aren’t created through fertilization and could never give rise to a person, some researchers argue that they shouldn’t be subject to the 14-day rule.</p>



<p>In the United States, there is no law banning growing embryos past 14 days, but the 1995 Dickey-Wicker amendment prohibits the U.S. National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryos or embryo-like cells with “organismal potential,” Clark says. Since these models lack critical parts, they have no potential to make an organism — so research with embryo models can be funded.</p>



<p>The international stem cell society recently updated its guidelines, suggesting that if scientists want to culture embryos created by fertilization for longer than 14 days, they need to seek public approval in their jurisdiction. Since the models are not embryos, the society’s guidelines suggest that they can be cultured up until a structure called the primitive streak appears, signaling that the embryo is starting to build the body.</p>



<p>The goal for most scientists in the field is to understand the process by which cells assemble an embryo and then create all the organs and tissues of the body, Martinez Arias says. It’s neither necessary nor desirable, and perhaps not even possible, to build a perfect replica of an embryo. “I certainly do not think that that is something that we want to do, or that we should do or should say,” he says. “And that&#8217;s not something that is on the horizon.”</p>



<p>Even so, scientists need to hit the pause button to thoroughly evaluate the embryo-like structures and determine how they can aid in understanding human development, Martinez Arias says. “I hope that now we can all develop these systems in a manner that is useful for research, rather than trying to see how far into space we [can] go, without thinking [about] how we return.”</p>



<p>Conversations with the public about what the embryo models represent scientifically, philosophically and legally, and about how to use them ethically need to start now, Hasson says. “We need to think about them now because it&#8217;s not the case, and it shouldn&#8217;t be the case, that the technical limits of what scientists can currently do with these models should define the ethical discussion and what the ethical limits should be.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viking-age-ancient-solar-flare-trade-archaeology">How an ancient solar flare illuminated the start of the Viking Age</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">Calamity after calamity befell Europe at the beginning of the so-called Dark Ages. The Roman Empire collapsed in the late fifth century. Volcanic eruptions in the mid-sixth century blocked out the sun, causing crop failure and famine across the Northern Hemisphere. Meanwhile, the Justinian Plague arrived, killing, by some estimates, nearly half of everybody in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, and scores of others elsewhere.</p>



<p>And then, on June 8, 793, a group of marauders attacked a small island off the northeastern coast of Great Britain. As Christian monks noted in the <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em>, “heathen men destroyed God’s church in Lindisfarne island by fierce robbery and slaughter.”</p>





<p>With that description, the Vikings entered the annals of medieval history as merciless raiders, having also killed a local official in southern Great Britain in 789. From today’s perspective, these Norse seafarers burst into existence seemingly out of nowhere.</p>



<p>Exactly when and why the Vikings first turned their boats away from shore to sail south over the horizon and into the unknown is hotly debated. According to some historians, another development in the late eighth century offers a clue: Silver coins known as dirhams made their way to Europe from the Islamic world in the Middle East. Around this time, Viking men in what is now Norway and Sweden became obsessed with silver as a means to purchase brides made scarce by female infanticide, or so a popular theory holds. A desperate need for silver, it was thought, motivated the Vikings’ initial trips across the North and Baltic seas and somehow precipitated their infamous raids.</p>



<p>Other historians, however, suspect the Vikings’ first forays into the outside world long preceded their violent raids and had nothing to do with a quest for silver.</p>



<p>“Our understanding of the chronology of the early Viking Age is really patchy because our best accounts are sometimes written 100 years later,” says Matthew Delvaux, a medieval historian at Princeton University. That includes the description of the Lindisfarne raid in the <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em>.</p>



<p>Fortunately, medieval scholars have recently found another aid to turn to: a solar storm.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Søren Sindbæk and his colleagues at Aarhus University in Denmark have reconstructed the timing of the Vikings’ early voyages by harnessing the power of what was likely a supermassive solar flare that erupted in 775. The flare has helped the team improve radiocarbon dating and thus more precisely date artifacts excavated at Ribe, Denmark, the site of an early medieval trading post.</p>



<p>The chronology of events at Ribe reveals a less violent start for Viking voyages, at least 50 years before the Lindisfarne raid. The secret of Viking success, Sindbæk believes, is best explained by skillful trading, not fearsome raiding.</p>



<p>More precise radiocarbon dating has the potential to reveal other aspects of the medieval world once thought lost to history.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Viking Age archaeology at Ribe</h4>



<p>Since the 1970s, archaeologists have been probing Ribe, on the North Sea, for artifacts that could help explain one of the deepest mysteries in medie­val history: how, within the span of mere decades, hardscrabble farmers wedged between dangerous seas and impenetrable forests became the Vikings who dominated Europe for nearly 300 years — a period known as the Viking Age.</p>





<p>At some point, a few highly motivated seafarers from the Scandinavian Peninsula made it across the treacherous 100-kilometer Skagerrak strait to Ribe. There, among a cluster of thatched single-story houses on a sandy outcrop rising above a tidal marsh, the Vikings left clues to why they had come.</p>



<p>Sindbæk imagines how Ribe, already a marketplace for settlements to the south, would’ve looked to those early Vikings. “What would impress you at first sight would be all those masts,” he says. “There would be more ships than you’ve ever seen in your life.”</p>



<p>Ribe, Denmark’s oldest town, eventually linked trade routes crisscrossing across northern Europe. The artifacts excavated along its narrow streets reveal when the early Vikings first arrived and where they spread next, expanding their influence around the region.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Early medieval trade routes in northern Europe</h3>



<p>In the early medieval period, Ribe was a hub of international trade, with trade routes bringing goods from across northern Europe and the Middle East. Dashed lines show routes where goods probably passed through intermediaries before heading to Ribe.</p>

<p>Starting in June 2017 for 15 consecutive months, Sindbæk’s group uncovered extensive <a href="https://projects.au.dk/northernemporium/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence of trade in Ribe</a>, starting around the year 700. In clay floors of houses that had functioned as both residences and workshops, the Aarhus team found glass beads, including a kaleidoscopic array of colorful Middle Eastern beads, embedded among debris from prolific metalworking, hide preparation, weaving and bone carving. These were all telltale remains of a Viking Age trading town, where a variety of people met, mingled and hawked their wares.</p>



<p>And they did so peacefully. There is virtually no archeological evidence of violent conflict in Ribe, contrary to the popular myth of Vikings as bloodthirsty barbarians.</p>



<p>“From the beginning Ribe seems to have been a sort of safe haven. You can land here, you’ll be safe. We’re not going to plunder you. We’ll try to outsmart you,” Sindbæk says.</p>



<p>In all, he and his colleagues unearthed more than 100,000 artifacts — tools, accessories and trinkets that would come to define Viking Age culture. In many cases, these objects were made with materials sourced from the Scandinavian Peninsula inhabited by the early Vikings. Some beauties stand out. A magnificent amber battle axe pendant hints at the Vikings’ warrior ethos. Combs carved from reindeer antlers display intricate designs. Terrifying beasts adorn oval brooches. The face of the Viking god Odin graces coins. The artifacts had value beyond their utility or inherent beauty. Back home on the Scandinavian Peninsula, these prestige items gave social status to those who delivered or received them.</p>



<p>“You can kind of show off your ability to participate in these interregional networks the same way that we might show off our ability to purchase a foreign car,” Delvaux says.</p>



<p>Digging down through the centuries, there were many generations of workshops. Twenty shop floors strewn with artifacts. Two hundred years of continuous manufacturing activity compressed into 2½ vertical meters.</p>



<p>Richard Hodges, an archaeologist and past president of the American University of Rome, visited the site in 2018. It’s “a layer cake of superimposed workshops, one on top of another,” he says. “Some burned down. Some of them were just demolished. Every one of them was producing huge amounts of material culture.”</p>



<p>With the layers often bleeding together, the Aarhus team needed to radiocarbon-date each one to put the artifacts in a clear chronological order and reveal the timing of events that produced them.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The limitations of radiocarbon dating</h4>



<p>For decades, radiocarbon dating has been a go-to technique for archaeologists. It takes advantage of the fact that when living organisms take in carbon and incorporate it into their tissues, some fraction of the carbon is a radioactive version of the element. It takes 5,730 years for half of that radiocarbon to decay into a form of nitrogen. Knowing that half-life and the amount of radiocarbon in, say, a bone or piece of charcoal helps scientists calculate the age of that organic matter.</p>



<p>But the amount of radiocarbon in the atmosphere — and thus taken up by plants during photosynthesis and then by the animals that eat them — fluctuates over time, so scientists must calibrate their measurements to estimate a true calendar date. Tree rings are handy for this purpose; each one records the atmospheric radiocarbon content in the year it formed. Experts have used trees of known ages from around the world to compile a curve called IntCal20 that plots fluctuations in radiocarbon over the last 55,000 years to help researchers calibrate radiocarbon dates.</p>



<p>But IntCal20’s annual tree ring data are sparse for parts of the eighth and ninth centuries. So archaeologists haven’t been able to date Viking-era artifacts precisely enough to explain the Vikings’ emergence on the global stage.</p>



<p>To fill the gap, physicist Bente Philippsen, a member of the Aarhus team, performed her own calibration using oak tree specimens from the National Museum of Denmark — one of which befittingly had been part of a bridge built by Viking King Harald Bluetooth (the great unifier of people in Denmark and Norway in the 10th century after whom the eponymous device-linking technology is named).</p>

<p>But even with the extra calibration, Philippsen couldn’t narrow the possible age range of a given layer enough to know exactly when Vikings first arrived or when long-distance trading networks reached the town.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">An ancient solar flare boosts radiocarbon precision</h4>



<p>To zero in on the timing of these events, the Aarhus team looked to see if signs of an ancient solar flare were recorded at the site. In 775, a few literate observers in western Europe reported seeing the impact of a solar storm. Celestial phenomena streaking across the sky were described in various ways: a red cross, inflamed shields, fire from heaven. Some people saw “snakes” slither with the same movements as the aurora borealis.</p>



<p>At the atomic level, solar particles streaming into Earth’s atmosphere kicked off nuclear reactions that transformed some nitrogen atoms into an unstable variant of carbon with six protons and eight neutrons: the isotope carbon-14, or radiocarbon.</p>



<p>Typically, 99 percent of atmospheric carbon is carbon-12, which has six protons and six neutrons. Only one in a trillion atoms of the remaining 1 percent is carbon-14; the rest is carbon-13. But these ratios vary ever-so-slightly over time due to carbon-14’s unstable nature. In 775, the solar storm created 1.2 percent more carbon-14 than usual. That ratio of carbon isotopes became imprinted on any organisms alive at the time.</p>



<p>Physicist Fusa Miyake of Nagoya University in Japan and colleagues first <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered this 775 spike in radiocarbon</a> about a decade ago, in the rings of Japanese cedar trees. Counting the annual rings, she was able to pinpoint the year of the solar storm. It turns out that the sun has on several occasions, about once every millennium and a half or so it appears, sent flares in our direction with enough energy to make measurably more carbon-14.</p>



<p>So while the Aarhus team peeled back layer upon layer of wet clay and sand along one of Ribe’s ancient streets, Philippsen set out to see if any of those layers might date to 775. Up to her elbows in mud and clay at the site, she searched for the right bits of organic material to date.</p>



<p>“I’ve been trained in all the [excavation] methods, so it’s safe for them to let me be in the trench and work, and you get a really good understanding of the samples,” Philippsen says.</p>



<p>Of all the startling finds in Ribe, the site’s trash held the most potential to shed light on the origins of Viking Age trade. Twigs, rye, barley, oats, nutshells and other refuse still lying around more than 1,000 years later possibly bore the time stamp of the supermassive flare.</p>



<p>Philippsen shuttled between her lab at Aarhus and the dig at Ribe with 140 samples plucked from different workshop layers. Trading her trowel for a scalpel, she diced up her bits of ancient oak and ran them along with samples from the site through the lab’s accelerator mass spectrometer, which counts carbon-12 and carbon-14 atoms by sorting them according to mass.</p>



<p>Two pieces of charcoal and a hazelnut shell from a combmaker’s workshop turned out to have the same ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 as the oak tree rings dated to 775.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ribe is a time capsule of early medieval trade</h4>



<p>Once Philippsen identified a workshop layer dated to 775, every other workshop and its artifacts above and below fell into a decade-by-decade chronological order. And with that sequence, Sindbæk and colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04240-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pieced together the evolution of trade at Ribe</a>, reporting the findings in 2022 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Around the year 700, ceramics and repurposed Roman glass appear at Ribe, indicating trade with the Franks of the Rhine Valley in what’s now Germany. By the 740s, early Vikings were arriving in ships large enough to carry blocks of Swedish and Norwegian stone. In the 750s, reindeer antler appears from a species not found outside of Norway’s hinterlands — more signs of a Viking presence. Craftspeople in town turned those bulk items into sought-after combs and sharpening stones. In exchange, vendors probably offered the early Vikings beads and brooches that would become the ubiquitous hallmarks of the Viking Age. These items also show up later in other Viking trading towns, such as Birka in Sweden. Finally, around 790, a cache of beautiful beads arrived in Ribe, likely via Russia, indicating new Middle Eastern trade connections.</p>

<p>This scenario strongly suggests, if not proves, that Viking explorations began as regional trading expeditions, not as a desperate bid for Middle Eastern silver, Sindbæk’s team argues.</p>



<p>Given the similar timing, the possibility that the raids somehow relate to Middle Eastern trade goods just then finding their way into northern Europe raises important questions.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing this intensification of [Middle] Eastern trade on the Scandinavian periphery of the North Sea, and that precedes the intensification of Viking raiding in the British Isles,” Delvaux says. “Did this trade stimulate the raids? Were they raiding so they would pick up things to engage in Eastern trade? Did the raids start because people wanted to compete with Eastern trade? I could trade with the Muslims for silver or else I can raid the English for it, right?” Delvaux asks rhetorically.</p>



<p>Regardless, the solar flare clearly demarcates a moment of first contact between emerging civilizations. Sindbæk can imagine how it happened.</p>



<p>The Middle Eastern beads, he says, probably traveled north from the Mesopotamian heartland in several-pound bags before being handed over to a merchant in present-day Turkey, who probably followed nomadic trails north to the forest steppe somewhere in northern Ukraine. There, the merchant may have met Vikings who had come east across the Baltic Sea and exchanged the beads for furs or enslaved people. The beads dispersed through Scandinavian markets, ultimately arriving in Ribe.</p>



<p>Ribe is awash in these imported beads after 790, while the locally made black-and-yellow-striped “wasp beads” individually crafted exclusively in Ribe disappear from the archaeological record. The reason, the Aarhus team concludes, is competition.</p>



<p>Craftspeople living several thousand kilometers away mass-produced beads by dicing up long rods of glass. People now had to ask themselves: “Do I want the beads that are made by Sven on the corner, or do I want the beads Olaf is bringing in from God-knows-where, but he could give me 30 of them for the same price that Sven can make me one?” Delvaux says.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Future questions to address</h4>



<p>The solar flare in 775 and a slightly weaker one in 993 with a distinct carbon spike have revealed how Vikings were trying to touch every corner of the globe. Using that 993 solar flare, another group of archaeologists finally confirmed when Vikings lived in North America. Wooden objects at the L’Anse aux Meadows site in Newfoundland, Canada, hold the signature of the 993 flare. Counting tree rings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03972-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed when the timbers to make those objects had been cut</a> — in the year 1021, the team reported in 2022 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>

<p>Vikings weren’t the only ones reaching beyond their horizons at the time. A diverse set of trader-explorers in Afro-Eurasia also survived perilous sea crossings and found each other in towns akin to Ribe. Solar flare–aided radiocarbon dating could bring their stories to light as well.</p>



<p>“We can put different cultures and regions on the same timeline, no matter whether they had a tradition of history writing or not,” Philippsen says. “This makes it much easier to study contacts and the causes and effects of developments in different parts of the world. Environmental and climate records are also dated by radiocarbon … we can also check how societies responded to climate change, and how cultural developments are connected with changes in the environment.”</p>



<p>Archaeologist Mark Horton of the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, England, agrees that solar flares “enable us to create a much more precise timetable for history.” But in trading towns around the Indian Ocean where he works, for example, dead trees decay out of existence very quickly, leaving huge gaps in the radiocarbon calibration curve for the Southern Hemisphere, SHCal20, making it more difficult to fill them in as Philippsen did.</p>



<p>Next up for Philippsen is helping Aarhus archaeologist Sarah Croix radiocarbon-date early Christian graves to test King Harald Bluetooth’s claim that he converted Denmark to Christianity. If the graves predate his rule, then Bluetooth would’ve been, let’s say, exaggerating.</p>



<p>“Radiocarbon dating now approaches the precision of traditional historical sources, so it becomes relevant for studying ‘recent’ history, not only prehistory,” Philippsen says. “We can thus study the lives of individuals who are not mentioned in historical sources, i.e., ‘normal people,’ with the same chronological precision as those of the rulers, the literate, or whoever wrote or was written about.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-mission-boulder-asteroid-space">NASA’s DART mission lofted a swarm of boulders into space</a></h4>

              
                <p>When a probe smashed into a small asteroid last year, the collision did more than change the asteroid’s orbit — it blasted a few dozen hefty boulders into space too.</p>



<p>Last September, NASA steered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">the DART spacecraft into Dimorphos</a>, a moonlet of the larger asteroid Didymos, to test a strategy for knocking any future Earth-bound asteroids off course (<em>SN: 10/11/22</em>). About three months after the impact, the Hubble Space Telescope spied <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ace1ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a halo of 37 previously unseen objects</a> accompanying the space rock duo in their orbit around the sun, researchers report in the July 21<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters.</em></p>





<p>The boulders probably aren’t bits that were pulverized from larger rocks during the impact. Instead, simulations suggest they were likely intact when they were blasted off Dimorphos and could have been launched off the moonlet’s rubble-covered surface by the energy of either the collision or the seismic waves bouncing around inside it in the wake of the impact.</p>



<p>Still, “there’s a lot of uncertainty in such simulations,” planetary astronomer David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Based on the brightness of the new objects, some of the dimmest ever spied by Hubble in our solar system, Jewitt and colleagues estimate that these boulders may be as wide as 7 meters. At least 15 are larger than 4 meters across. Together, the researchers calculate, the boulders probably weigh just over 5 million kilograms — roughly the weight of 300 dump truck loads of gravel.</p>



<p>Repeated observations by Hubble reveal that, on average, the boulders are drifting away from Dimorphos and Didymos at about 1 kilometer per hour — a little faster than the escape velocity for the double asteroid system. So, Jewitt says, the boulders, as well as a presumed multitude of rocks too small and dim for Hubble to see, will eventually break away from the asteroid system’s orbit and circle the sun on their own.</p>

<p>Sage Publishing is retracting 37 articles from an engineering journal after finding “indicators of third party involvement” in the peer review process. </p>



<p>The publisher’s investigation continues, and more papers may be retracted, a spokesperson for the company told Retraction Watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A single <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09544089231188713">retraction notice</a> lists the links of the 37 papers to be retracted from <em>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E: Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering</em>. The notice states: </p>



<span id="more-127573"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After an internal investigation Sage became aware that the peer-review process for these articles had been compromised and contains indicators of third-party involvement.</p>



<p>As these were accepted because of a peer-review process that did not meet Sage’s expectations of high quality and ethical peer-review, the publisher cannot uphold the integrity of the research. In line with COPE guidelines and Sage policies, these articles are retracted.</p>



<p>The authors have been informed of this decision using the email addresses provided at submission.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00713">Ooi Kim Tiow</a>, the journal’s editor in chief and an associate provost at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only one of the papers has attracted notice on PubPeer. In June of last year, sleuth Alexander Magazinov <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F62C83E94CD638BD4744AA87C727DB#1">commented</a> that “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09544089221082489">Applications of fractional derivatives in MHD free-convective oscillating flow of a blood based CNTs nanofluid across a porous medium</a>” contained “A hollow sentence with a bulk citation to the benefit of a certain YM Chu.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early this year, Sage became aware of concerns with the journal’s content after one article “showed indicators of third party activity and compromised peer review,” a spokesperson said. The publisher began an investigation and reviewed “all submissions that showed indicators of suspicious activity. We asked which article tipped off the investigation, but Sage was not able to share the title by our deadline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spokesperson said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Sage is deeply committed to research integrity and righting the academic record. We have recently expanded our Research Integrity Group and have a full dedicated team who are actively working to guard against ethical misconduct – strengthening our use of tools and technology to undercover suspicious activity in papers, improving policies, and identifying journals where there may be similar issues. As a result, we anticipate further retractions to come as we uncover and address potential misconduct. We will continue to support our Editors and Assistant Editors in peer review best practices, and we have provided them with additional guidance on how to identify suspicious activity in journal submissions.</p>

<p>Sage was one of the first publishers to recognize large-scale peer review manipulation and begin retracting papers in bulk nine years ago. We <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/08/sage-publications-busts-peer-review-and-citation-ring-60-papers-retracted/">wrote</a> back in 2014 that a batch of 60 retractions involved in a peer review and citation ring “deserves a ‘wow.’” In recent years, however, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/20/new-record-major-publisher-retracting-100-studies-cancer-journal-fake-peer-reviews/">publishers</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/20/journal-retracts-more-than-400-papers-at-once/">have been</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/03/exclusive-plos-one-to-retract-more-than-100-papers-for-manipulated-peer-review/">retracting</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/23/publisher-retracts-350-papers-at-once/">even more</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">papers</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">at once</a> for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/20/deplorable-imaging-journal-to-retract-nearly-80-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">similar reasons</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the Sage spokesperson what’s changed since 2014, and if the systems put in place to catch such problems needed updating. The response:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve increased our investment in correcting the academic record and this is a sign of those efforts. We have recently put together a full team whose main purpose is to investigate these issues using new technology to help them along the way and then to improve policies and processes for the future. We have more than 1,100 journals so this can take time but we are very committed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Other publishers have <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/21/research-misconduct-journals-hiring-research-integrity-czars/">long had such teams</a>, some for well over a decade.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-body-mapping-technique-mouse-organ">With a new body mapping technique, mouse innards glow with exquisite detail</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mouse’s entire nervous system lights up in psychedelic hues. Clumps of immune cells attacking tumors give off a ghostly glow. The vessels that make up the body’s sewer system flare brightly.</p>



<p>These and other images are shining a new light on the inner workings of mice, thanks to a new technique <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01846-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that makes whole body imaging cheaper and faster</a>, researchers report July 10 in <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>.</p>



<p>See-through mice <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/clearing-anatomy-see-through-mouse">are nothing new</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/14</em>). But existing techniques to image their insides can be expensive, time-consuming or don’t hit the right target. Now, a study shows that chemically removing cholesterol — an essential component of cell membranes — from dead mice creates spongelike holes in tissues without destroying them. That means tailored antibodies can move through the holes to infiltrate every corner of the body and bind to proteins of interest to make entire anatomical features visible under fluorescent light.</p>





<p>The technique, dubbed wildDISCO, gives scientists an extraordinarily thorough peek under mouse skin to create body-wide anatomical atlases. It’s a bit like Google Maps, says Ali Ertürk, a neuroscientist at Helmholtz Munich. But in place of cars driving around to record every street, antibodies act as streetlamps to illuminate scientific landmarks.</p>



<p>Such maps could help researchers train artificial intelligence programs to simulate bodily processes in mice. The algorithms would aim, for example, to simulate how a drug travels through blood vessels, or predict the path of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">genetically engineered immune cells</a> for cancer therapy, Ertürk says (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>). Computational simulations of biology may help researchers move away from doing animal experiments, he says.&nbsp;</p>

Mai <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Biotechnology </em>2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To make the mice glow, Ertürk and colleagues pumped cholesterol-removing chemicals along with antibodies tagged with fluorescent molecular markers into the dead animals via the heart and blood vessels, a proven tactic that allows liquids to traverse the entire body. Then the team made all the tissues transparent, and the mice were ready for their close-ups.</p>



<p>One of the resulting maps depicts a comprehensive view of the network of nerves that runs beneath the skin and around organs. Another shows off the lymphatic system, an open network of organs and lymphatic vessels that helps fight off pathogens and transport cellular waste for removal.</p>



<p>These blueprints yielded some scientific nuggets.</p>



<p>Images taken of the nervous systems, for instance, showed that mice with no microbes in their bodies had underdeveloped nerve networks in their guts compared with normal mice, suggesting that the gut microbiome plays an important role in helping nerves develop.</p>



<p>And in mice with cancer, the team documented clumps of immune cells inside and near the tumors. The role that these clusters play in controlling cancer is unclear, Ertürk says. But wildDISCO offers scientists a way to investigate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>wildDISCO might also help with studies that focus on animals other than mice, says Yijun Su, an imaging specialist at Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va., who was not involved in the work. Scientists working with fruit flies, frogs or zebra fish might use a similar “recipe,” he says, to take clearer snapshots of their anatomy.</p>
