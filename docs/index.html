              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carvings-australia-boab-trees-lost-history">Carvings on Australia’s boab trees reveal a generation’s lost history</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brenda Garstone is on the hunt for her heritage.</p>



<p>Parts of her cultural inheritance are scattered across the Tanami desert in northwestern Australia, where dozens of ancient boab trees are engraved with Aboriginal designs. These tree carvings — called dendroglyphs — could be hundreds or even thousands of years old, yet have received almost no attention from western researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is slowly starting to change. In the winter of 2021, Garstone — who is Jaru, an Aboriginal group from the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia — teamed up with archaeologists to find and document some of these carvings.</p>



<p>For Garstone, the expedition was a bid to piece back together the disparate parts of her identity. These pieces were scattered 70 years ago when Garstone’s mother and three siblings were among the estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children taken from their families by the Australian government. Like many others, the siblings were sent to live at a Christian mission thousands of kilometers from home. It would take decades of effort and a series of unconnected events — including the gift of an heirloom and a researcher’s quest to find out what happened to a missing 19th century European naturalist — for Garstone’s family to reclaim its birthright.</p>

This boab is just 5.5 meters in diameter, making it the smallest carved tree found during the expedition.  </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119217">S. O’Connor</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When the siblings returned to their mother’s homeland as teenagers, their extended family gave Garstone’s aunt, Anne Rivers, a coolamon, a type of shallow dish, decorated with two bottle trees, or boabs. Rivers, who was only 2 months old when she was sent away, was told that the trees were a part of her mother’s Dreaming, the cultural story that connected her and her family to the land.</p>



<p>Now, in a study published October 11 in <em>Antiquity</em>, researchers have <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/art-in-the-bark-indigenous-carved-boab-trees-adansonia-gregorii-in-northwest-australia/A0D28A02BF4966DA6C9611DBE7AC8510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meticulously described 12 boabs with dendroglyphs in the Tanami desert that have links to Jaru culture</a>. And just in time: The clock is ticking for these ancient engravings as their host trees succumb to the ravages of time and growing pressure from livestock and possibly climate change.</p>





<p>The race to document these engravings before it’s too late isn’t just a matter of studying an ancient art form. It’s also a matter of healing the wounds inflicted by policies intended to erase the connection between Garstone’s family and the land.</p>



<p>“To find evidence that ties us to the land has been amazing,” she says. “The puzzle we’ve been trying to piece together is now complete.”</p>



<h4>An outback archive</h4>



<p>Australian boabs (<em>Adansonia gregorii</em>) proved pivotal to this project. Found in the northwestern corner of Australia, boabs are a species of tree easily recognizable by their massive trunks and iconic bottle shape.</p>





<p>Anthropologists have written about the existence of trees carved with Aboriginal symbols in Australia since the early 1900s. These records indicate that people were continuously carving and recarving some trees until at least the 1960s. But compared with other forms of Aboriginal art — such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-key-dating-12000-year-old-aboriginal-rock-art">visually spectacular paintings also found in the area</a> (<em>SN: 2/5/20</em>) — “there does not appear to be a wide general awareness of this art form,” says Moya Smith, curator of anthropology and archaeology at the Western Australia Museum in Perth, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Darrell Lewis has come across his share of carved boabs. The historian and archaeologist now at the University of New England in Adelaide has worked in the Northern Territory for half a century. Lewis has spotted engravings made by cattle drovers, World War II soldiers and Aboriginal peoples. He calls this eclectic bag of engravings “the outback archive” — a physical testament to the people who have made this rugged part of Australia their home.</p>



<p>In 2008, Lewis was searching the Tanami Desert for what he hoped would be his biggest addition to the archive. He’d heard rumors that a cattle drover working in the area a century earlier had found a firearm stashed in a boab marked with the letter “L.” A roughly cast brass plate from the firearm — later bought by the National Museum of Australia — was stamped with the name of the famed German naturalist Ludwig Leichhardt, who disappeared in 1848 while traveling across western Australia.</p>



<p>The Tanami is generally considered to be outside the boab’s natural range. So in 2007, Lewis rented a helicopter and crisscrossed the desert in search of the Tanami’s secret stash of boabs. His flyovers revealed roughly 280 centuries-old boabs and hundreds of younger trees scattered across the desert.</p>



<p>“Nobody, not even locals, really knew there were any boabs out there,” he recalls.</p>

<h3>Finding lost boab carvings</h3>



<p>Boab trees grow in the northwestern corner of Australia. A survey (green rectangle) of a region on the edge of the Tanami Desert revealed a patch of boab trees carved with dendroglyphs, which tie the region to the path (gray arrow) of the King Brown Snake Dreaming, or Lingka Dreaming. This ancient trail connects cultural sites and stories across thousands of kilometers and mirrors the journey of Lingka, one of the spiritual beings that shaped the landscape into its present form. &nbsp;</p>

<p>His 2008 ground expedition to find the elusive “L” came up empty-handed. But the search did uncover dozens of boabs marked with dendroglyphs.</p>



<p>In a report for the National Museum of Australia, which had hired him to search for the “L” carving, Lewis recorded the location of these trees. That information sat untouched for years until one day, it fell into the hands of Sue O’Connor, an archaeologist at Australian National University in Canberra.</p>



<h4>Crumble into dust</h4>



<p>In 2018, O’Connor was part of a group of archaeologists who were growing increasingly concerned about the survival of boabs. That year, scientists studying baobabs in Africa — a close relative of boabs — noticed that some of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-african-baobabs-are-dying-and-no-one-knows-why">older trees were dying out at a surprisingly high rate</a>, potentially due to climate change (<em>SN: 6/18/18</em>).</p>



<p>The news alarmed O’Connor. Dendroglyphs are often engraved on the largest and oldest boabs. While nobody knowns exactly how old these trees can get, researchers suspect that their lifetimes could be comparable to their African cousins, which can live up to 2,000 years.</p>



<p>When these long-lived trees do die, they pull a disappearing act. Unlike other trees, whose wood can be preserved for hundreds of years after death, boabs have a moist and fibrous interior that can quickly disintegrate. Lewis has witnessed boabs crumble into the dust a couple of years after being struck by lightning.</p>



<p>“You would never know there’d been a tree there,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether Australian boabs are threatened by climate change is unclear. But the trees are coming under attack from livestock, which peel back boabs’ bark to get to the wet interior. “We put all this together and thought we better try and locate some of the carvings because they probably won’t be there in a few years,” says O’Connor.</p>



<p>Lewis’ report provided a good jumping-off point for this work. So O’Connor reached out to the historian and suggested they collaborate.</p>



<p>Around that same time, Garstone was four years into her own research into her family’s heritage. The long and meandering search led her to a small museum that a friend of Lewis’ happened to run. When Garstone mentioned she was from Halls Creek — a town near where Lewis did his fieldwork in 2008 — the curator told her about the carved boabs.</p>



<p>“I was like, ‘What? That’s a part of our Dreaming!’” she recalls.</p>

<p>Dreamings are a western term used to refer to the vast diversity of stories that — among other things — recount how spiritual beings formed the landscape. Dreaming stories also pass down knowledge and inform rules of behavior and social interaction.</p>



<p>Garstone knew from the oral history passed down through her family that her grandmother had ties to the Bottle Tree Dreaming, as indicated by the trees painted on her aunt’s coolamon. The Bottle Tree Dreaming is one of the eastern-most manifestations of the Lingka Dreaming track (Lingka is the Jaru word for the King Brown Snake). This path runs for thousands of kilometers from the western coast of Australia and into the neighboring Northern Territory, marking Lingka’s journey across the landscape and forming a byway for people to travel across the country.</p>



<p>Eager to confirm that the boabs were a part of this Dreaming, Garstone, along with her mother, aunt and a scattering of other family members, joined the archaeologists on their mission to rediscover the boabs.</p>



<h4>Into the Tanami</h4>



<p>On a winter day in 2021, the group set out from the town of Halls Creek and set up camp on a remote pastoral station mainly populated by cattle and feral camels. Every day, the team climbed into all-wheel-drive vehicles and headed out to the last known location of the engraved boabs.</p>



<p>It was hard work. The crew often drove hours to the supposed position of a boab, only to have to stand on top of the vehicles and scan for trees in the distance. What’s more, wooden stakes sticking out of the ground constantly shredded the vehicles’ tires. “We were out there for eight or 10 days,” says O’Connor. “It felt<em> longer</em>.”</p>



<p>The expedition was cut short when they ran out of tires — but not before finding 12 trees with dendroglyphs. To document the finds, the archaeologists took thousands of overlapping pictures, capturing an image of every centimeter of each tree.</p>

O’Connor</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The team also spotted grinding stones and other tools scattered around the base of the trees. Considering that large boabs provide shade in a desert with little cover, the prevalence of these objects suggests that people probably used the trees as resting spots as well as navigational markers while traveling across the desert, the researchers report in their study.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the carvings on the boabs were of emu and kangaroo tracks. But an overwhelming majority of the engravings were of snakes, some of which undulated across the bark while others coiled onto themselves. The knowledge provided by Garstone and her family, along with historical records from the area, points toward the carvings being linked to the King Brown Snake Dreaming. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was surreal,” Garstone says. Seeing the dendroglyphs confirmed the stories passed down in her family and is “pure evidence” of the ancestral connection to country, she says. The rediscovery has been healing, especially for her mother and aunt, both now in their 70s. “All of this was nearly lost because they didn’t grow up in their homeland with their families,” she says.</p>



<h4>Maintaining the connection</h4>



<p>The work to find and document carved boabs in the Tanami and in other parts of the country has just begun. But this initial foray reveals the “vital importance” of scientists working in collaboration with First Nations knowledge holders, says Smith.</p>



<p>O’Connor is organizing another expedition to find the rest of the engravings that Lewis spotted, though she intends to take better wheels or — ideally — a helicopter. Garstone is planning on coming along with more of her extended family in tow.</p>



<p>In the meantime, O’Connor says that their work appears to have stimulated interest among researchers and other Aboriginal groups to rediscover the lost art form and preserve it for future generations.</p>



<p>“Our connection to country is so important to maintain because it makes us who we are as First Nations people,” adds Garstone. “To know that we have a rich cultural heritage and to have our own museum in the bush is something we will treasure forever.”</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap">Great scientists become immortalized in various ways.</p>



<p>Some through names for obscure units of measurement (à la Hertz, Faraday and Curie). Others in elements on the periodic table (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/periodic-table-history-chemical-elements-150-anniversary">Mendeleev</a>, Seaborg, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-atom-went-quantum">Bohr</a>, among many others). A few become household names symbolizing genius — like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/celebrating-newton">Newton in centuries past</a> and nowadays, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einsteins-genius-changed-sciences-perception-gravity">Einstein</a>. But only one has been honored on millions and millions of cartons of milk: the French chemist, biologist and evangelist for experimental science Louis Pasteur.</p>





<p>Pasteur was <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/chemistry-biographies/louis-pasteur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born 200 years ago</a> this December, the most significant scientist birthday bicentennial since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/january-31-2009">Charles Darwin’s in 2009</a>. And Pasteur ranked behind only Darwin among the most exceptional biological scientists of the 19th century. </p>



<p>Pasteur not only made milk safe to drink, but also rescued the beer and wine industry. He established the germ theory of disease, saved the French silkworm population, confronted the scourges of anthrax and rabies, and transformed the curiosity of vaccination against smallpox into a general strategy for treating and preventing human diseases. He invented microbiology and established the foundations for immunology.</p>

<p>Had he been alive after 1901, when Nobel Prizes were first awarded, he would have deserved one every year for a decade. No other single scientist demonstrated more dramatically the benefit of science for humankind.</p>



<p>He was not, however, exactly a saint. A Pasteur biographer, Hilaire Cuny, called him “a mass of contradictions.” Pasteur was ambitious and opportunistic, sometimes arrogant and narrow-minded, immodest, undiplomatic and uncompromising. In the scientific controversies he engaged in (and there were many), he was pugnacious and belligerent. He did not suffer criticism silently and was often acerbic in his responses. To his laboratory assistants, he was demanding, dictatorial and aloof. Despite his revolutionary spirit in pursuing science, in political and social matters, he was conformist and deferential to authority.</p>



<p>And yet he was a tireless worker, motivated by service to humankind, faithful to his family and unwaveringly honest. He was devoted to truth, and therefore also to science.</p>



<h4>How Pasteur developed pasteurization</h4>





<p>In his youth, Pasteur did not especially excel as a student. His interests inclined toward art rather than science, and he did display exceptional skill at drawing and painting. But in light of career considerations (his father wanted him to be a scholar), Pasteur abandoned art for science and so applied to the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris for advanced education. He finished 15th in the competitive entrance examination, good enough to secure admission. But not good enough for Pasteur. He spent another year on further studies emphasizing physical sciences and then took the École Normale exam again, finishing fourth. That was good enough, and he entered the school in 1843. There he earned his doctoral degree, in physics and chemistry, in 1847.</p>



<p>Among his special interests at the École Normale was crystallography. In particular he was drawn to investigate tartaric acid. It’s a chemical found in grapes responsible for tartar, a potassium compound that collects on the surfaces of wine vats. Scientists had recently discovered that tartaric acid possesses the intriguing power of twisting light — that is, rotating the orientation of light waves’ vibrations. In light that has been polarized (by passing it through certain crystals, filters or some sunglasses), the waves are all aligned in a single plane. Light passing through a tartaric acid solution along one plane emerges in a different plane.</p>



<p>Even more mysteriously, another acid (paratartaric acid, or racemic acid), with the exact same chemical composition as tartaric acid, did not twist light at all. Pasteur found that suspicious. He began a laborious study of the crystals of salts derived from the two acids. He discovered that racemic acid crystals could be sorted into two asymmetric mirror-image shapes, like pairs of right-handed and left-handed gloves. All the tartaric acid crystals, on the other hand, had shapes with identical asymmetry, analogous to gloves that were all right-handed.</p>

PASTEUR/ANNALES DE CHIMIE ET DE PHYSIQUE 1848</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Pasteur deduced that the asymmetry in the crystals reflected the asymmetric arrangement of atoms in their constituent molecules. Tartaric acid twisted light because of the asymmetry of its molecules, while in racemic acid, the two opposite shapes canceled out each other’s twisting effects.</p>



<p>Pasteur built the rest of his career on this discovery. His research on tartaric acid and wine led eventually to profound realizations about the relationship between microbes and human disease. Before Pasteur, most experts asserted that fermentation was a natural nonbiological chemical process. Yeast, a necessary ingredient in the fermenting fluid, was supposedly a lifeless chemical acting as a catalyst. Pasteur’s experiments showed yeast to be alive, a peculiar kind of “small plant” (now known to be a fungus) that caused fermentation by biological activity.</p>



<p>Pasteur demonstrated that, in the absence of air, yeast acquired oxygen from sugar, converting the sugar to alcohol in the process. “Fermentation by yeast,” he wrote, is “the direct consequence of the processes of nutrition,” a property of a “minute cellular plant … performing its respiratory functions.” Or more succinctly, he proclaimed that “fermentation … is life without air.” (Later scientists found that yeast accomplished fermentation by emitting enzymes that catalyzed the reaction.)</p>



<p>Pasteur also noticed that additional microorganisms present during fermentation could be responsible for the process going awry, a problem threatening the viability of French winemaking and beer brewing. He solved that problem by developing a method of heating that eliminated the bad microorganisms while preserving the quality of the beverages. This method, called “pasteurization,” was later applied to milk, eliminating the threat of illness from drinking milk contaminated by virulent microorganisms. Pasteurization became standard public health practice in the 20th century.</p>



<p>Incorporating additional insights from studies of other forms of fermentation, Pasteur summarized his work on microbial life in a famous paper published in 1857. “This paper can truly be regarded as the beginning of scientific microbiology,” wrote the distinguished microbiologist René Dubos, who called it “one of the most important landmarks of biochemical and biological sciences.”</p>



<h4>The germ theory of disease is born</h4>



<p>Pasteur’s investigations of the growth of microorganisms in fermentation collided with another prominent scientific issue: the possibility of spontaneous generation of life. Popular opinion even among many scientists held that microbial life self-generated under the proper conditions (spoiled meat, for example). Demonstrations by the 17th century Italian scientist <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/classics-science-redi-disproves-spontaneous-generation">Francesco Redi challenged that belief</a>, but the case against spontaneous generation was not airtight.</p>

<p>In the early 1860s Pasteur undertook a series of experiments that should have left no doubt that spontaneous generation, under conditions encountered on Earth today, was an illusion. Yet he was nevertheless accosted by critics, such as the French biologist Charles-Philippe Robin, to whom he returned verbal fire. “We trust that the day will come when M. Robin will … acknowledge that he has been in error on the subject of the doctrine of spontaneous generation, which he continues to affirm, without adducing any direct proofs in support of it,” Pasteur remarked.</p>



<p>It was his work on spontaneous generation that led Pasteur directly to the development of the germ theory of disease.</p>



<p>For centuries people had suspected that some diseases must be transmitted from person to person by close contact. But determining exactly how that happened seemed beyond the scope of scientific capabilities. Pasteur, having discerned the role of germs in fermentation, saw instantly that something similar to what made wine go bad might also harm human health.</p>



<p>After disproving spontaneous generation, he realized that there must exist “transmissible, contagious, infectious diseases of which the cause lies essentially and solely in the presence of microscopic organisms.” For some diseases, at least, it was necessary to abandon “the idea of … an infectious element suddenly originating in the bodies of men or animals.” Opinions to the contrary, he wrote, gave rise “to the gratuitous hypothesis of spontaneous generation” and were “fatal to medical progress.”</p>



<p>His first foray into applying the germ theory of disease came during the late 1860s in response to a decline in French silk production because of diseases afflicting silkworms. After success in tackling the silkworms’ maladies, he turned to anthrax, a terrible illness for cattle and humans alike. Many medical experts had long suspected that some form of bacteria caused anthrax, but it was Pasteur’s series of experiments that isolated the responsible microorganism, verifying the germ theory beyond doubt. (Similar work by <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/robert-koch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Koch in Germany</a> around the same time provided further confirmation.)</p>



<p>Understanding anthrax’s cause led to the search for a way to prevent it. In this case, a fortuitous delay in Pasteur’s experiments with cholera in chickens produced a fortunate surprise. In the spring of 1879 he had planned to inject chickens with cholera bacteria he had cultured, but he didn’t get around to it until after his summer vacation. When he injected his chickens in the fall, they unexpectedly failed to get sick. So Pasteur prepared a fresh bacterial culture and brought in a new batch of chickens.</p>



<p>When both the new chickens and the previous batch were given the fresh bacteria, the new ones all died, while nearly all of the original chickens still remained healthy. And so, Pasteur realized, the original culture had weakened in potency over the summer and was unable to cause disease, while the new, obviously potent culture did not harm the chickens previously exposed to the weaker culture. “These animals have been vaccinated,” he declared.</p>



<p>Vaccination, of course, had been invented eight decades earlier, when <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/edward-jenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British physician Edward Jenner</a> protected people from smallpox by first exposing them to cowpox, a similar disease acquired from cows. (Vaccination comes from cowpox’s medical name, vaccinia, from <em>vacca</em>, Latin for cow.) Pasteur realized that the chickens surprisingly displayed a similar instance of vaccination because he was aware of Jenner’s discovery. “Chance favors the prepared mind,” Pasteur was famous for saying.</p>



<p>Because of his work on the germ theory of disease, Pasteur’s mind was prepared to grasp the key role of microbes in the prevention of smallpox, something Jenner could not have known. And Pasteur instantly saw that the specific idea of vaccination for smallpox could be generalized to other diseases. “Instead of depending on the chance finding of naturally occurring immunizing agents, as cowpox was for smallpox,” Dubos observed, “it should be possible to produce vaccines at will in the laboratory.”</p>



<p>Pasteur cultured the anthrax microbe and weakened it for tests in farm animals. Success in such tests not only affirmed the correctness of the germ theory of disease, but also allowed it to gain a foothold in devising new medical practices.</p>



<p>Later Pasteur confronted an even more difficult microscopic foe, the virus that causes rabies. He had begun intense experiments on rabies, a horrifying disease that’s almost always fatal, caused usually by the bites of rabid dogs or other animals. His experiments failed to find any bacterial cause for rabies, leading him to realize that it must be the result of some agent too small to see with his microscope. He could not grow cultures in lab dishes of what he could not see. So instead he decided to grow the disease-causing agent in living tissue — the spinal cords of rabbits. He used dried-out strips of spinal cord from infected rabbits to vaccinate other animals that then survived rabies injections.</p>



<p>Pasteur hesitated to test his rabies treatment on humans. Still, in 1885 when a mother brought to his lab a 9-year-old boy who had been badly bitten by a rabid dog, Pasteur agreed to administer the new vaccine. After a series of injections, the boy recovered fully. Soon more requests came for the rabies vaccine, and by early the next year over 300 rabies patients had received the vaccine and survived, with only one death among them.</p>



<p>Popularly hailed as a hero, Pasteur was also vilified by some hostile doctors, who considered him an uneducated interloper in medicine. Vaccine opponents complained that his vaccine was an untested method that might itself cause death. But of course, critics had also rejected Pasteur’s view of fermentation, the germ theory of disease and his disproof of spontaneous generation.</p>

<p>Pasteur stood his ground and eventually prevailed (although he did not turn out to be right about everything). His attitude and legacy of accomplishments inspired 20th century scientists to develop vaccines for more than a dozen deadly diseases. Still more diseases succumbed to antibiotics, following the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming — who declared, “Without Pasteur I would have been nothing.”</p>



<p>Even in Pasteur’s own lifetime, thanks to his defeat of rabies, his public reputation was that of a genius.</p>



<h4>Pasteur&#8217;s scientific legacy</h4>



<p>As geniuses go, Pasteur was the opposite of Einstein. To get inspiration for his theories, Einstein imagined riding aside a light beam or daydreamed about falling off a ladder. Pasteur stuck to experiments. He typically initiated his experiments with a suspected result in mind, but he was scrupulous in verifying the conclusions he drew from them. Preconceived ideas, he said, can guide the experimenter’s interrogation of nature but must be abandoned in light of contrary evidence. “The greatest derangement of the mind,” he declared, “is to believe in something because one wishes it to be so.”</p>



<p>So even when Pasteur was sure his view was correct, he insisted on absolute proof, conducting many experiments over and over with variations designed to rule out all but the true interpretation.</p>



<p>“If Pasteur was a genius, it was not through ethereal subtlety of mind,” wrote Pasteur scholar Gerald Geison. Rather, he exhibited “clear-headedness, extraordinary experimental skill and tenacity — almost obstinacy — of purpose.”</p>

<p>His tenacity, or obstinacy, helped him persevere through several personal tragedies, such as the deaths of three of his daughters, in 1859, 1865 and 1866. And then in 1868 he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage that left him paralyzed on his left side. But that did not slow his pace or impair continuing his investigations.</p>



<p>“Whatever the circumstances in which he had to work, he never submitted to them, but instead molded them to the demands of his imagination and his will,” Dubos wrote. “He was probably the most dedicated servant that science ever had.”</p>



<p>To the end of his life, Pasteur remained dedicated to science and the scientific method, stressing the importance of experimental science for the benefit of society. Laboratories are “sacred institutions,” he asserted. “Demand that they be multiplied and adorned; they are the temples of wealth and of the future.”</p>



<p>Three years before his death in 1895, Pasteur further extolled the value of science and asserted his optimism that the scientific spirit would prevail. In an address, delivered for him by his son, at a ceremony at the Sorbonne in Paris, he expressed his “invincible belief … that science and peace will triumph over ignorance and war, that nations will unite, not to destroy, but to build, and that the future will belong to those who will have done most for suffering humanity.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pasteur.fr/en/bicentenary-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two hundred years after his birth</a>, ignorance and war remain perniciously prominent, as ineradicable as the microbes that continue to threaten public health, with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">the virus causing COVID-19</a> the latest conspicuous example. Vaccines, though, have substantially reduced the risks from COVID-19, extending the record of successful vaccines that have already tamed not only smallpox and rabies, but also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/epidemics-infectious-disease-influenza-covid-pandemic">polio, measles and a host of other once deadly maladies</a>. </p>



<p>Yet even though vaccines have saved countless millions of lives, some politicians and so-called scientists who deny or ignore overwhelming evidence <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccine-hesitancy-history-damage-anti-vaccination">continue to condemn vaccines</a> as more dangerous than the diseases they prevent. True, some vaccines can induce bad reactions, even fatal in a few cases out of millions of vaccinations. But shunning vaccines today, as advocated in artificially amplified social media outrage, is like refusing to eat because some people choke to death on sandwiches.</p>



<p>Today, Pasteur would be vilified just as he was in his own time, probably by some people who don’t even realize that they can safely drink milk because of him. Nobody knows exactly what Pasteur would say to these people now. But it’s certain that he would stand up for truth and science, and would be damn sure to tell everybody to get vaccinated.</p>

                <p>We’re very excited to announce that Hugging Face has collaborated with arXiv to make papers more accessible, discoverable, and fun. Starting today, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces">Hugging Face Spaces</a> is integrated with arXivLabs through a Demo tab that includes links to demos created by the community or the authors themselves. By going to the Demos tab of your favorite paper in the arXiv categories of computer science, statistics, or electrical engineering and systems science, you can find links to open-source demos and try them out immediately.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1317" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2022/11/Recording-2022-11-15-at-13.05.28.gif" alt="Gif showing how to navigate to the demo tab" width="2256" height="1502" /></p>
<p>Since its launch in October 2021, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces">Hugging Face Spaces</a> has been used to build and share over 12,000 open-source machine learning demos crafted by the community. With Spaces, Hugging Face users can share, explore, discuss models, and build interactive applications that enable anyone with a browser to try them out without having to run any code. These demos are built using open-source tools such as the Gradio and Streamlit Python libraries, and leverage models and datasets available on the Hugging Face Hub.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest arXiv integration, users can now find the most popular demos for a paper on its arXiv abstract page. For example, if you want to try out demos of the BERT language model, you can go to the BERT paper’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">arXiv page</a>, and navigate to the demo tab. You will see more than 200 demos built by the open-source community &#8212; some demos simply showcase the BERT model, while others showcase related applications that modify or use BERT as part of larger pipelines, such as the demo shown above.</p>

<p>Demos allow a much wider audience to explore machine learning as well as other fields in which computational models are built, such as biology, chemistry, astronomy, and economics. They help increase the awareness and understanding of how models work, amplify the visibility of researchers&#8217; work, and allow a more diverse audience to identify and debug biases and other issues. The demos increase the reproducibility of research by enabling others to explore the paper&#8217;s results without having to write a single line of code. We are thrilled about this integration with arXiv and can’t wait to see how the research community will use it to improve communication, dissemination and interpretability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maya-rulers-attract-subjects-guatemala-tamarindito">Some Maya rulers may have taken generations to attract subjects</a></h4>

              
                <p>Commoners may have played an unappreciated part in the rise of an ancient Maya royal dynasty.</p>



<p>Self-described “divine lords” at a Maya site called Tamarindito in what’s now Guatemala left glowing hieroglyphic tributes to themselves as heads of a powerful “Foliated Scroll” dynasty.</p>



<p>But new findings indicate that the bigwigs at Tamarindito spent many generations waiting for their subjects to show up, or perhaps hatching plans to attract followers, say archaeologist and epigrapher Markus Eberl of Vanderbilt University in Nashville and colleagues.</p>





<p>Tamarindito’s kings founded their capital by about the year 400 as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-antiquity/article/early-classic-genesis-of-the-royal-maya-capital-of-tamarindito/602DDA6CDE88FD72A13077BB75AC11DA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mere hamlet of perhaps a few dozen individuals</a>, consisting of a royal court and a couple of residential clusters for non-elites, the scientists report November 4 in <em>Latin American Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>It took about 150 years for enough people to trickle in to Tamarindito to enable the site’s rulers to expand their power, Eberl says. At that point, Foliated Scroll rulers founded a smaller, second capital and several other settlements in northern Guatemala. Those rulers went on to achieve peak power roughly between the years 550 and 800.</p>



<p>Royal art and writing at Tamarindito and other Classic Maya sites misleadingly suggest that kings wielded absolute power, Eberl contends. “In the case of Tamarindito, Maya rulers had to legitimize their authority and build power, likely negotiating with and convincing non-elites” to become subjects.</p>



<p>Hieroglyphics proclaiming the divine power and mythological origins of Foliated Scroll rulers have been studied since Tamarindito’s discovery in 1958. The hieroglyphic emblem of those rulers depicted the curly stalk of a water lily native to lowland Guatemala. Over seven field seasons beginning in 2009, Eberl’s group excavated and surveyed much of the site and documented all surviving royal inscriptions.</p>



<p>Illegal logging at Tamarindito made it possible to identify most of the site’s structures in ground surveys.</p>



<p>No signs of a precursor settlement to Tamarindito were found, making the site a good place to study how Maya rulers constructed a power center from scratch, Eberl says.</p>





<p>Early activity at Tamarindito focused on building a ceremonial center that consisted of a pyramid, a royal palace and a large plaza atop a 70-meter-high hill. That ritual area, with the plaza as its centerpiece, was a relatively small-scale project. From 23 to 31 laborers could have built those structures in 25 years, the researchers estimate.</p>



<p>But Foliated Scroll rulers’ royal ambitions, as expressed at the ritual center, far outpaced demographic reality. Despite a sparse number of locals, Tamarindito’s plaza initially provided space for around 1,650 people to gather, Eberl says. Any public assembly would have fallen far short of the plaza’s crowd capacity, he suspects.</p>



<p>Decorative styles of pottery recovered from 43 groups of non-elite dwellings at Tamarindito largely date to between 600 and 850, when most of the site’s residents arrived, the investigators say — several hundred years after the city was founded. The ritual plaza was expanded during that time span.</p>



<p>Maya people constructed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-reveals-oldest-biggest-ancient-maya-structure-found-mexico">even larger ceremonial plazas than the one at Tamarindito</a> by around 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 6/3/20</em>). Those ritual centers may have been periodically attended by groups scattered across vast regions, says archaeologist Francisco Estrada-Belli of Tulane University in New Orleans.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether enough ancient settlements existed within a day’s walk of Tamarindito to have supported large plaza gatherings on special occasions, says Estrada-Belli, who did not participate in the new study. Tamarindito’s rulers signified their power over a wide area by constructing an impressive ritual center, he suspects.</p>



<p>Even at its peak, no more than several thousand people lived at Tamarindito, Eberl says. That’s a surprisingly limited number considering that aerial laser maps reported by Estrada-Belli and colleagues have revealed large, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">interconnected Maya cities now obscured by forests</a> in other parts of northern Guatemala (<em>SN: 9/27/18</em>).</p>



<p>The next step, Estrada-Belli says, is to assemble an aerial laser map of at least 100 square kilometers around Tamarindito to see if it was built in relative isolation.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Belinda Hankins first grappled with COVID-19 in the spring of 2020. She had a fever, chills and trouble breathing, but the real clincher was her loss of smell. Hankins remembers opening a canister of Tony Chachere’s creole seasoning, lowering her nose to take a whiff, and not smelling a thing. “That stuff usually clears the kitchen,” she says.</p>





<p>Her second infection, two years later, was worse. After 12 long weeks of endless fatigue and aching joints, her doctor suggested she seek treatment for long COVID. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus">lingering, sometimes full-body condition</a> can plague people for months or years after a COVID-19 infection (SN Online: 7/29/22).</p>



<p>In late August, I joined Hankins, age 64, in a small exam room for her first in-person consultation at the Johns Hopkins Post-Acute COVID-19 Team clinic. Wearing a navy dress and a blue surgical mask, Hankins is sitting in a chair across from physician Alba Azola. As they discuss Hankins’ symptoms, doctor and patient face each other, Azola occasionally swiveling her stool to tap notes into a computer.</p>



<p>Hankins’ symptoms are extensive. Brain fog, fatigue and pain top the list. She’s depressed. Sleep doesn’t feel restful. She has trouble focusing, is often light-headed and regularly loses her balance. Even walking to the clinic from the parking lot left her winded and in pain. “I’m extremely exhausted,” she says. “I have not felt good in a long time.” Hankins, pauses, wiping away a tear. “I wasn’t like this before.”</p>

<h4>A life upended</h4>



<p>Listen to Belinda Hankins describe her experience with long COVID in this short clip.</p>

<p>Hankins, a retired digital media consultant, used to be an avid skier and a cyclist. She loved to travel and dance and was planning to learn how to play golf. She’s not sure what the future holds, though she tells me she still has faith she can be active again.</p>



<p>Treating people with long COVID can be complicated – especially for Hankins and those who have other medical conditions. She has pulmonary hypertension, fibromyalgia and the connective tissue disease scleroderma. It’s tricky to tease out which symptoms come from the viral infection. Azola’s approach is to listen, ask questions and listen some more. Then, she’ll zero in on a patient’s most pressing concerns. Her goal: manage their symptoms. “How can we make their quality of life better?” she asks.</p>

<h4>System overload</h4>



<p>On the afternoon of Hankins’ visit, it’s a warm summer day in Baltimore, blue skies laden with fleecy clouds. Inside the labyrinthine halls of Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, the vibe is not quite as sunny: bright lights, shiny floors, people in line and people in scrubs. Everyone I see is masked.</p>



<p>Azola meets me in the waiting area, walking briskly and wearing bright red glasses. Before the pandemic, Azola, a rehabilitation physician, treated patients recovering from strokes, spinal cord injuries and other disorders. Most mornings, she still works with these patients. But for the past two years, her afternoons have been booked with people laid low by COVID-19.</p>



<p>She’s squeezed me in to talk about the Johns Hopkins PACT clinic, which opened in April 2020, around the time when the world hit one million confirmed cases. “To be honest, we didn’t know what to expect,” Azola says. Back then, most of the clinic’s patients were recovering from COVID-19 after a stay in the hospital’s intensive care unit. Now, at least half of their patients never got sick enough with COVID-19 to be hospitalized – yet still had symptoms they couldn’t shake. In a single week, Azola and her colleagues may get 30 referrals. “It’s constant,” she says, “more than we can provide service to.”</p>



<p>As those referrals pile up, patient wait times can stretch. The PACT clinic expanded last summer, and now has more than a dozen people on staff, including therapists, physicians and other specialists. They try to keep the wait to around two months, Azola says, but sometimes it takes up to four months for a patient to be seen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="370" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/110522_long-covid-inline-3-azola.jpg" alt="A female doctor (left) speaks with a female patient (right)" class="wp-image-3118619" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/110522_long-covid-inline-3-azola.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/110522_long-covid-inline-3-azola-330x180.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118619">Alba Azola (left), a rehabilitation physician at Johns Hopkins Medicine, focuses on managing the symptoms of her patients with long COVID.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118619">JOHNS HOPKINS POST-ACUTE COVID-19 TEAM (PACT)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The demand here and at clinics across the country isn’t likely to let up. As of mid-November, the United States has reported nearly <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalcases_totalcasesper100k_00" target="_blank" rel="noopener">97.9 million cases of COVID-19</a>. Though long COVID numbers can be hard to pin down, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33415-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 hadn’t fully recovered six to 18 months after their infection,</a> according to a large Scottish study published in <em>Nature Communications</em> on October 12. A more conservative estimate from the United States suggests that more than <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.12.22279862v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 million U.S. adults could have long COVID</a>.</p>



<p>“We are in the middle of a mass disabling event,” says Talya Fleming, a physician at the JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute in Edison, N.J.</p>



<h4>Scattershot solutions</h4>



<p>In the United States, some 400 clinics have popped up from coast-to-coast to care for the growing wave of long COVID patients.</p>



<p>Although the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation has published some guidance, no gold-standard therapies exist and there are no formal criteria for long COVID clinic performance. The Academy brought together more than 40 post-COVID clinics, including the Hopkins PACT clinic, to share experiences and discuss best practices for long COVID treatment. “We’re kind of guiding each other,” Azola says. Other clinics in the United States are more-or-less forging their own paths.</p>



<p>Today, Azola and colleagues are focusing on their patients’ symptoms, a strategy other long COVID doctors and clinics are using too. “There is no one, singular long COVID experience,” says pulmonologist Lekshmi Santhosh. So doctors really need to take a “customized, symptom-directed approach.”</p>



<p>Santhosh founded the <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/clinics/lung-health-center-at-parnassus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OPTIMAL clinic</a> at the University of California, San Francisco to provide <a href="https://medconnection.ucsfhealth.org/news/ucsf-post-covid-clinic-treats-long-haulers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up care for people who had COVID-19</a>. Since 2020, she’s seen hundreds of patients, who can wait weeks to months for an appointment, like they do at Hopkins. One main question Santhosh hears from patients is: “When am I going to get better?” That’s hard to answer, she admits.</p>

<ul><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Stomach pain</li></ul>
</div>



<p>Scientists can’t yet predict how or when a patient will recover, and they don’t know <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-epstein-barr-link-risk">why long COVID strikes some people and spares others</a>. Right now, there are no obvious rules. “If you are young, you can get long COVID. If you have no pre-existing health conditions, you can get long COVID. If you’ve had COVID before, you still can get long COVID,” Fleming says. The list goes on.</p>



<p>At UCSF, Santhosh says she’s seen it all. Long COVID can affect a 75-year-old patient who was hospitalized for COVID-19, or a 35-year-old marathoner whose stubborn symptoms developed after just a mild infection. One patient can be hit with a hailstorm of health conditions, another patient, just a few.</p>



<p>“I’ve heard some weird things,” Azola says. She remembers one patient who felt as if a phone were vibrating deep inside their bones. Another described a sensation of heaviness, like their legs were made of lead.</p>



<p>Long COVID’s scattershot symptoms currently require a smorgasbord of solutions. For headaches, a doctor might prescribe a combo of pain relievers. For shortness of breath, an inhaler to open the airways could help. For brain fog, patients might visit a therapist who can help them with word-finding issues. Such symptom management is necessary, Azola says, because “we don’t have strong, randomized controlled trials to support the use of specific medications or treatments,” she says.</p>



<p>Developing effective therapies has been “frustratingly slow,” Santhosh says. Scientists are still trying to understand what’s happening in the body that spurs long COVID and lets symptoms simmer away unchecked. “The underlying biology is unclear,” she says. That makes it “unclear exactly what treatments might work.”</p>



<p>Long COVID’s biological underpinnings are a hot topic among researchers today, says Mike VanElzakker, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, and part of the <a href="https://lc19.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long COVID Research Initiative</a>, a group working to study and treat the condition. Scientists have scads of hypotheses for what causes long COVID symptoms, including lungs scarred by SARS-CoV-2 or the reawakening of some other, long-slumbering virus. One idea posits that COVID-19 might sabotage the immune system, inviting other microbes to do harm. Another idea pins long COVID on caches of coronavirus hiding within the body’s tissues.</p>



<p>“It really does matter what’s causing these problems,” VanElzakker says. If doctors knew what’s driving a patient’s symptoms, they might be able to offer personalized treatments aimed at the illness’s root.</p>



<h4>Filling the void</h4>



<p>On Facebook pages and websites around the internet, purported long COVID treatment options abound.</p>



<p>Vitamins, supplements, alternative medicines: general internist Aileen Chang in Washington, D.C. used to hear all the time from long COVID patients about therapies they’ve tried. In the fall of 2020, Chang and colleagues started the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates COVID-19 Recovery Clinic, which later closed its doors due to a staffing shortage. She recalls patients who flew to different countries to have their blood filtered and others who took “every sort of supplement you can imagine,” she says. “They’re looking for solutions.”</p>



<p>Without clear data on what long COVID treatments work, opportunists have stepped in to fill the void. Some unproven treatments may be scams with serious side effects; they can also drain patients financially. “They’re spending all this money on things they think will make them better,” Chang says, “but the truth is… we don’t know.”</p>



<p>What scientists do know is that potential long COVID treatments are still in their early days. There’s some evidence that getting a COVID-19 vaccine can improve long COVID patients’ symptoms, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00354-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">though this idea is still controversial</a>, researchers reported in November in eClinicalMedicine. And repeated sessions of breathing 100 percent oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber might relieve fatigue and brain fog, small studies of patients have suggested.</p>

<p>Last year, the U.S. National Institutes of Health launched a massive research project on the long-term effects of COVID-19. Called the <a href="https://recovercovid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RECOVER Initiative</a>, the project aims to uncover why some people get long COVID and to identify underlying causes. As of November 11, RECOVER has enrolled 10,645 of an estimated 17,680 adults needed.</p>



<p>It’s a great initiative, Santhosh says, but it got rolling relatively late – well after long COVID had already upended many people’s lives. “We need… a lot more funding and a lot more therapeutic trials,” she says. Santhosh is hopeful that, in the coming months and years, doctors will have solid answers on what treatments actually work. “There are a lot of tantalizing biological leads,” she says. Though she knows that this timeframe can feel agonizingly long to patients and clinicians.</p>

<p>For people with long COVID, finding a place to get appropriate medical care is a challenge. <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-clinics-map-locations-prevalence">Read more and explore our interactive maps</a>.</em> </p>

<h4>Real life</h4>



<p>In the meantime, Santhosh, Azola and other physicians are borrowing strategies that help for other disorders – like myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Many of the symptoms of that still-mysterious illness <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overlap with those of long COVID</a>, a symmetry that could bring answers for both disorders, scientists suggest September 8 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>One common approach isn’t a treatment like pills or surgery, it’s more of a shift in behavior: Don’t overdo it, Santhosh says. “We talk to our long COVID patients about this all the time, about the need to rest, to pace yourself and how to gently bring back your aerobic fitness.”</p>



<p>Long COVID patients with fatigue can be tempted to try and push through, to keep speeding through life as they had before their diagnosis. But that doesn’t seem to work for people with chronic fatigue, and “for some long COVID patients, it can actually make things worse,” she’s found.</p>



<p>Azola has similar advice for Hankins. About a half hour into the appointment, Azola slides away from the computer desk, and turns toward her patient. “This is the part where people want to punch me in the face,” she tells Hankins, pushing her glasses up onto her head. “We don’t have a magic wand that makes [you] feel better.”</p>



<p>Instead, Hankins will need to check her body’s battery every day, conserve energy where she can, and build in opportunities to recover. Little tricks, like sitting in a chair while showering or prepping food, can help patients save enough juice to make it through the day. Azola hopes to get Hankins off the “corona coaster,” where patients can feel relatively good one day, and the next day, crash. Having energy levels constantly crater can erode a patient’s ability to live their lives, she says.</p>

<h2>Staying hopeful</h2>



<p>In this short clip, Belinda Hankins looks to the future.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111422_longcovid_hankins_clip2.mp3" controlslist="nodownload"></audio></figure>



<div style="text-transform: uppercase;line-height: 12px;font-size: 10px;letter-spacing: 0.75px">Audio: M. Rosen</div>
</div>



<p>For the next 20 minutes, doctor and patient talk about how Hankins’ life has changed and what her next steps will be. In a week, she’ll meet with a neuropsychologist who will help her cope with her new reality; Azola also refers Hankins to a pain specialist.</p>



<p>The two women have spent about an hour together – a near-eternity for a medical appointment. For Azola, it’s time well spent. “The most important thing is to listen to patients and keep an open mind,” she says.</p>



<p>When I speak with Hankins nearly three weeks later, she’s still feeling hopeful. She’s met with the neuropsychologist, and will continue to receive follow-up care. For Hankins, a care plan that factors in all of her conditions, including long COVID, may one day let her feel like herself again.</p>



<p>For now, she’s hoping that sharing her story will help others struggling with the illness. When she tells people she has long COVID, she says, “some of them don’t even think it’s real.”</p>

<p><strong>Editor Highlights:</strong></p>
<p>I was delighted to have been given the opportunity to attend the <a href="https://www.eventscribe.net/2022/PharmSci360/">AAPS PharmSci 360</a> this year. Well known for combining the vibrancy of a large scientific conference with the feel of a focused, intimate symposium, the meeting provided a great opportunity for <em>BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology </em>to build on existing collaborations, and create new ones. Home to more than 1,000 biotechnology companies and giving rise to innovative developments in healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry, Boston was a fitting location for the meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting successfully covered all aspects of the pharmaceutical field, from discovery and basic research, to preclinical development. My personal favorite was the symposium session on &#8220;Microbiome: Impact in Pharmaceutical Development and Disease&#8221;. Among the talks, <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/cox/home">Professor Laura Cox</a> from Harvard Medical School presented a very engaging talk on microbiome-based therapeutic approaches in treating neurologic diseases. In the same symposium, an excellent presentation by <a href="https://science.psu.edu/bmb/people/jpb6325">Professor Jordan Bisanz</a> from Pennsylvania State University explored the interactions between drugs and microbes at nucleotide level. During the Hot Topic sessions, the full house talk by <a href="https://www.collaborationspharma.com/team">Dr Sean Ekins</a> from Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on <em>The Potential Dark Side of AI for Drug Discovery </em>warned us of the dual use of AI, and was a talk to remember indeed.</p>

<p><strong>Editorial Board Member Highlights: </strong></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of listening to the fascinating talk presented by one of our Editorial Board Members, <a href="https://pharmacology.arizona.edu/person/patrick-t-ronaldson-phd">Professor Patrick Ronaldson</a>, from the University of Arizona College of Medicine, which was coincidentally related to my research background in blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport.</p>
<p>Due to poor translatability of compounds from preclinical to clinical studies, drug development for ischemic stroke has proven to be a challenge. Work from Professor Ronaldson’s laboratory emphasized the significance of BBB transport mechanisms in preclinical development of drugs for neurological diseases, such as ischemic stroke. In their study, they demonstrated the critical role of endogenous BBB transport mechanisms (i.e., organic anion transporting polypeptides, organic cation transporters) for delivery of drugs — such as statins and memantine — in the central nervous system (CNS). We now understand that endogenous transporters can still function as critical targets for CNS drug delivery in dysfunctional BBB, such as in ischemic stroke. These findings provide the foundation for developing future treatment strategies for ischemic stroke.</p>
<p>Not only I had the privilege of learning more about research from his group; as an Editorial Board Member, Professor Ronaldson also gave us some key insights during our discussion:</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-13041 size-medium" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/Ronaldson_Photo_2022-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/Ronaldson_Photo_2022-198x300.jpg 198w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/Ronaldson_Photo_2022-675x1024.jpg 675w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/Ronaldson_Photo_2022-768x1165.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/Ronaldson_Photo_2022-1013x1536.jpg 1013w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/Ronaldson_Photo_2022-1350x2048.jpg 1350w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/Ronaldson_Photo_2022-640x971.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/Ronaldson_Photo_2022-scaled.jpg 1688w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" />What was your AAPS PharmSci 360 conference highlight? Any talks that piqued your interest?</strong></p>
<p><em>“The highlight of the meeting for me was the fact that AAPS successfully provided state-of-the-art basic science programming that covered several different types of drugs. To that end, there were multiple discussions on both large molecule and small molecule therapeutics that addressed both pharmacological and toxicological concerns.” </em></p>
<p><em>“Of particular note, sessions that I really enjoyed included “Advancements in Translational PK/PD Approaches Toward Novel Biological Modalities” and the symposium on “Rapid Discovery of Therapeutics: Past Experience and Computational Approaches.” Additionally, the hot topic session on “The Potential Dark Side of AI for Drug Discovery” was eye-opening and presented some of the negative aspects of readily available in silico technologies for drug discovery. “</em></p>
<p><strong>What are your insights on how we can drive <em>BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology’s </em>future growth?</strong></p>
<p><em>“I think that the journal should put forward some theme issues centered around megatrends in the pharmaceutical sciences. Application of big data to drug discovery is one idea. Another is novel strategies for selective drug delivery. For such theme issues, it is key to have some recognizable authors submit their work. This would help to attract more papers that discuss cutting science to the journal.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Emerging fields and hot topics to look out for in Pharmacology and Toxicology?</strong></p>
<p><em>“Big Data – not simply the acquisition of these data sets (RNAseq and omics data) but how it can (and should) be properly leveraged for drug discovery and therapeutic development. Drug Delivery – selective targeting strategies for proteins, antibodies, and nucleic acids as well as small molecules. Health Disparities – how racial and sex differences are being addressed in pharmacology/toxicology and its impact on precision medical treatments”</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say a huge thank you to Professor Patrick Ronaldson for meeting me at PharmSci 360, I hope you enjoyed our discussions as much as I did. <em>BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology</em> is looking forward to attending more meetings by AAPS. Thank you and congratulations to all the organizers for another successful year of PharmSci 360!</p>

While widely-used conventional two-dimensional cell models have been the gold standard for many decades, some of their main limitations include the lack of representation of the stromal population, the absence of a three-dimensional structure, and a poor representation of inter-tumour and intra-tumour heterogeneity. Therefore, a multitude of novel cancer models are emerging, which can advance the understanding of tumour pathophysiology and behavior. This will ultimately help improving patients’ clinical outcomes, through the introduction of more personalized and targeted treatments in the clinical setting.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteorite-uk-winchcombe-earth-water-asteroids">The pristine Winchcombe meteorite suggests that Earth’s water came from asteroids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Late in the evening of February 28, 2021, a coal-dark space rock about the size of a soccer ball fell through the sky over northern England. The rock blazed in a dazzling, eight-second-long streak of light, split into fragments and sped toward the Earth. The largest piece went splat in the driveway of Rob and Cathryn Wilcock in the small, historic town of Winchcombe.</p>



<p>An analysis of those fragments now shows that the meteorite came from the outer solar system, and contains water that is chemically similar to Earth’s, scientists report November 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>. How Earth got its water remains one of science’s enduring mysteries. The new results support the idea that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-did-earth-get-its-water">asteroids brought water to the young planet</a> (<em>SN: 5/6/15</em>).</p>



<p>The Wilcocks were not the only ones who found pieces of the rock that fell that night. But they were the first. Bits of the Winchcombe meteorite were collected within 12 hours after they hit the ground, meaning they are relatively uncontaminated with earthly stuff, says planetary scientist Ashley King of London’s Natural History Museum.</p>

The meteorite was so brittle it shattered on impact and made only a small dent in the driveway.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119336">R. Wilcock</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Other meteorites have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-meteorite-scientific-gold-mine">recovered after being tracked from space</a> to the ground, but never so quickly (<em>SN: 12/20/12</em>).</p>



<p>“It’s as pristine as we’re going to get from a meteorite,” King says. “Other than it landing in the museum on my desk, or other than sending a spacecraft up there, we can’t really get them any quicker or more pristine.”</p>





<p>After collecting about 530 grams of meteorite from Winchcombe and other sites, including a sheep field in Scotland, King and colleagues threw a kitchen sink of lab techniques at the samples. The researchers polished the material, heated it and bombarded it with electrons, X-rays and lasers to figure out what elements and minerals it contained.</p>



<p>The team also analyzed video of the fireball from the <a href="https://www.ukfall.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK Fireball Alliance</a>, a collaboration of 16 meteor-watching cameras around the world, plus many more videos from doorbell and dashboard cameras. The films helped to determine the meteorite’s trajectory and where it originated.</p>



<p>The meteorite is a type of rare, carbon-rich rock called a carbonaceous chondrite, the team found. It came from an asteroid near the orbit of Jupiter, and got its start toward Earth around 300,000 years ago, a relatively short time for a trip through space, the researchers calculate.</p>



<p>Chemical analyses also revealed that the meteorite is about 11 percent water by weight, with the water locked in hydrated minerals. Some of the hydrogen in that water is actually deuterium, a heavy form of hydrogen, and the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium in the meteorite is similar to that of the Earth’s atmosphere. “It’s a good indication that water [on Earth] was coming from water-rich asteroids,” King says.</p>





<p><a></a>Researchers also found amino acids and other organic material in the meteorite pieces. &#8220;These are the building blocks for things like DNA,” King says. The pieces “don’t contain life, but they have the starting point for life locked up in them.” Further studies can help determine how those molecules formed in the asteroid that the meteorite came from, and how similar organic material could have been delivered to the early Earth.</p>



<p>“It’s always exciting to have access to material that can provide a new window into an early time and place in our solar system,” says planetary scientist Meenakshi Wadhwa of Arizona State University in Tempe, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>She hopes future studies will compare the samples of the Winchcombe meteorite to samples of asteroids <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-sample-missions-hayabusa2-ryugu-osiris-rex-bennu">Ryugu and Bennu</a>, which were collected by spacecraft and sent back to Earth (<em>SN: 1/15/19</em>). Those asteroids are both closer to Earth than the main asteroid belt, where the Winchcombe meteorite came from. Comparing and contrasting all three samples will build a more complete picture of the early solar system’s makeup, and how it evolved into what we see today.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Nik Dennler will talk about a paper &quot;Neuromorphic Engineering Needs Closed-Loop Benchmarks&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neuromorphic engineering aims to build (autonomous) systems by mimicking
biological systems. It is motivated by the observation that biological
organisms- from algae to primates- excel in sensing their
environment, reacting promptly to their perils and opportunities. Furthermore,
they do so more resiliently than our most advanced machines, at a fraction of
the power consumption. It follows that the performance of neuromorphic systems
should be evaluated in terms of real-time operation, power consumption, and
resiliency to real-world perturbations and noise using task-relevant evaluation
metrics. Yet, following in the footsteps of conventional machine learning, most
neuromorphic benchmarks rely on recorded datasets that foster sensing accuracy
as the primary measure for performance. Sensing accuracy is but an arbitrary
proxy for the actual system's goal- taking a good decision in a
timely manner. Moreover, static datasets hinder our ability to study and
compare closed-loop sensing and control strategies that are central to survival
for biological organisms. This article makes the case for a renewed focus on
closed-loop benchmarks involving real-world tasks. Such benchmarks will be
crucial in developing and progressing neuromorphic Intelligence. The shift
towards dynamic real-world benchmarking tasks should usher in richer, more
resilient, and robust artificially intelligent systems in the future.</p>

                <p>Scientists have teamed up with tiger sharks to uncover the largest expanse of seagrasses on Earth. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A massive survey of the Bahamas Banks — a cluster of underwater plateaus surrounding the Bahama archipelago — reveals <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33926-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92,000 square kilometers of seagrasses</a>, marine biologist Oliver Shipley and colleagues report November 1 in <em>Nature Communications.</em> That area is roughly equivalent to half the size of Florida.</p>



<p>The finding expands the estimated global area covered by seagrasses by 41 percent — a potential boon for Earth’s climate, says Shipley, of the Herndon, Va.–based ocean conservation nonprofit Beneath The Waves. </p>

<p>Seagrasses can sequester carbon for millennia at rates <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/110004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35 times faster</a> than tropical rainforests. The newly mapped sea prairie may store 630 million metric tons of carbon, or about a quarter of the carbon trapped by seagrasses worldwide, the team estimates.</p>



<p>Mapping that much seagrass was a colossal task, Shipley says. Guided by previous satellite observations, he and colleagues dove into the sparkling blue waters 2,542 times to survey the meadows up close. The team also recruited eight tiger sharks to aid their efforts. Similar to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/slower-speed-tricky-turns-give-prey-chance-against-cheetahs-and-lions">lions that stalk</a> zebra through tall grasses on the African savanna, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/tiger-sharks-feast-migratory-birds-fall-out-sky">the sharks</a> patrol fields of wavy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seagrasses-boost-ecosystem-health-fighting-bad-bacteria">seagrasses</a> for grazing animals to eat (<em>SN: 1/29/18; SN: 5/21/</em>19, <em>SN: 2/16/17</em>).</p>





<p>“We wouldn’t have been able to map anywhere near the extent that we mapped without the help of tiger sharks,” Shipley says.</p>



<p>The team captured the sharks with drumlines and hauled each one onto a boat, mounting a camera and tracking device onto the animal’s back before releasing it. The sharks were typically back in the water in under 10 minutes. The team operated like “a NASCAR pit crew,” Shipley says.</p>



<p>Researchers had previously suggested tracking seagrass-grazing <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00009/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sea turtles and manatees</a> to locate pastures. But tiger sharks were a smart choice because they roam farther and deeper, says Marjolijn Christianen, a marine ecologist at Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands who was not involved in the new work. “That’s an advantage.”</p>

<p>Shipley and colleagues plan to collaborate with other animals — including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/lazy-sunfish-are-actually-active-predators">ocean sunfish</a> — to uncover more submarine meadows (<em>SN: 5/1/15</em>). “With this [approach], the world’s our oyster,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">Artemis I finally launched. Here’s what it means for human spaceflight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fifty years ago, three NASA astronauts splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, concluding the final Apollo mission. Less than a dozen years after President John F. Kennedy challenged the United States to commit itself to “landing a man on the moon and returning him safely back to the Earth,” that historic program had achieved its goals and ended.</p>



<p>Now, we’re going back. But this time will be different.</p>



<p>A pivotal moment for the return of crewed missions to the moon occurred at 1:47 a.m. EST on November 16, with the successful launch of Artemis I. NASA’s high-powered Space Launch System rocket roared and crackled as it lifted off the Florida coast on its maiden voyage. The rocket pushed the Orion capsule toward the moon, on a flight testing the technology that will eventually bring astronauts, both men and women, back to the lunar surface.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was just a spectacular launch,” says geologist Jose Hurtado of the University of Texas at El Paso, who works with NASA on mission simulations and programs to train astronauts in geology. “It really hits home to me what I love about space exploration, especially human exploration. It’s just an aspirational and inspirational spectacle, and I hope that everybody that was watching it got some of that inspiration.”</p>

<p>Now, the United States and China are leading the way to return humans to the moon. The two countries’ programs are massive and complex undertakings with potentially big payoffs. Both aim to boost scientific understanding about the moon and the early Earth, develop new technologies for space exploration and use on Earth, as well as set the stage for longer-term human space exploration.</p>



<h4>Better than rovers</h4>





<p>Apollo was “a technological program to serve political ends,” says space historian Teasel Muir-Harmony. It was rooted in the political tension and conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The program “was about winning the hearts and minds of the world public. It was a demonstration of world leadership … of the strength of democracy and then also of capitalism,” says Muir-Harmony, curator of the Apollo Spacecraft Collection at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took the first-ever steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Over the next few years, 10 more American men hopped, skipped and even drove across the pewter-colored, lifeless terrain of our planet’s only natural companion. Apollo 17 was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/perfect-ending-final-apollo">final mission</a> in that series of landings, ending on December 14, 1972 (<em>SN: 12/23/72, p. 404</em>). Once Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison H. Schmitt left their footprints embossed in the lunar dust and joined Ronald Evans in the command module, humans stopped walking on the moon.</p>



<p>In the decades since Apollo 17, about two dozen spacecraft from various countries have visited the moon. Some have orbited, others have slammed into the surface so researchers could study the material in the debris of those collisions, and some have landed and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-change-5-mission-moon-rocks-lunar-soil-sample">brought lunar samples back</a> to Earth (<em>SN: 1/16/21, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p>While these uncrewed spacecraft have made some big strides in lunar exploration, humans could do better. “Nothing can replace the value of having a human brain and human eyes there on the scene,” Hurtado says. </p>

<p>Over the 3.5-year span of the Apollo missions, a dozen astronauts spent a total of 80.5 hours exploring the surface near the moon’s equator. “They explored only the tiniest fraction of the moon,” says planetary scientist David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. Artemis crews will be checking out a new area: the south pole.</p>

<p>One moment during Apollo 17 makes his point. Schmitt, the only geologist to visit the moon, noticed a patch of lunar soil with a particular rusty hue. He walked over, contemplated the surroundings and realized it was evidence of a volcanic eruption. He and Cernan scooped up some of this orange soil for later Earth-based analyses, which revealed that the orange glass blobs in the soil did in fact form during a “fire fountain” explosion some 3.7 billion years ago.</p>



<p>That discovery supported the idea that the moon had hosted volcanoes in its youth, and additional analysis of the orange soil’s chemical composition hinted that the moon formed at around the same time as Earth. Scientists wouldn’t have had access to the orange soil if it wasn’t for Schmitt’s quick grasp that what he saw was important. “Probably the ultimate field tool is the well-trained human,” Hurtado says.</p>



<p>In his 2005 book, <em>Roving Mars</em>, planetary scientist Steven Squyres wrote: “The unfortunate truth is that most things our rovers can do in a perfect [Martian day], a human explorer on the scene could do in less than a minute.” Squyres, of Cornell University, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">led the Spirit and Opportunity rover missions to Mars</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 20</em>).</p>



<h4>A long-awaited lunar return</h4>



<p>Once Apollo ended, NASA shifted its focus to space stations to prepare for longer-term human spaceflight. Skylab launched in May 1973, hosting four crews of astronauts that year and the next. A few years later, the temporary station broke apart in the atmosphere, as planned. NASA’s next space station, the International Space Station, or ISS, was a larger, collaborative project that’s been hosting astronauts since November 2000. It’s still orbiting roughly 400 kilometers above Earth.</p>



<p>U.S. leaders have occasionally tried to shift NASA’s gaze from low Earth orbit, where the ISS flies, to a more distant frontier. Many presidents have proposed investments in different technology for different exploration goals and with different price tags. But by 2019, the plan was set: NASA would land humans on the moon’s south pole in 2024, though the timeline has since slipped.</p>



<p>“The first woman and the next man on the moon will both be American astronauts, launched by American rockets from American soil,” said Vice President Mike Pence in early 2019. Shortly after, NASA named this effort the Artemis program — after Apollo’s mythological twin sister.</p>



<p>The Artemis program is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars program, which aims to send humans farther into space than ever before. The moon is up first, with astronauts stepping on its surface as early as 2025. What the space agency and its partners learn during a few years of lunar exploration will help guide the phases beyond the moon, including sending astronauts to the Red Planet.</p>



<p>“The goal with Artemis is to build off everything we’ve done to this point and really start to establish a presence for humanity beyond low Earth orbit,” says planetary geologist Jacob Bleacher of NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>The first big test for Moon to Mars is to show that NASA’s rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS, which has been in development for over a decade at a cost of more than $20 billion, can successfully launch a crew capsule, without the crew, beyond low Earth orbit.</p>



<p>But that effort has had a rocky start with the Artemis I launch scrubbed twice for fuel leaks and delayed by two hurricanes. Now that it&#8217;s off the ground, Artemis I <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-artemis-moon-landing-test-launch">will test the SLS rocket and the Orion advanced crew capsule</a> on a roughly month-long trip beyond the moon and back (<em>SN: 8/26/22</em>). One more test flight, Artemis II, will follow a similar trajectory as the first mission, but with astronauts on board, launching no earlier than 2024.</p>



<p>Artemis III, slated for 2025, is expected to return boots to the moon and make history by landing the first woman on the lunar surface. On that flight, the SLS rocket will launch the Orion crew capsule toward the moon. When it arrives at lunar orbit, it will dock with the human landing system, currently in development by the company SpaceX. Two astronauts will board the SpaceX vehicle, which will bring them to the moon for a 6.5-day stay. That landing system will also bring the astronauts back to Orion, still in lunar orbit, which will then return them to Earth.</p>



<p>If all goes well, NASA plans to run Artemis missions roughly once a year. “We hope to, through those missions that follow Artemis III, build up some infrastructure,” Bleacher says. That infrastructure will include hardware for developing and distributing power on the moon, rovers for the astronauts to traverse long distances and eventually living and working quarters on the surface. The aim is to increase the astronauts’ length of stay from days to perhaps months.</p>



<p>To help support these lunar astronauts, NASA is leading the creation of a new space station. Called the Gateway, it will orbit the moon when complete, maybe by the 2030s. Like the International Space Station, which is scheduled to safely break apart in early 2031, Gateway will be an international and commercial research station. It will also serve as a way station for trips to Mars and beyond.</p>

<h4>The moon goddess</h4>



<p>NASA astronauts likely won’t be the only people exploring the lunar surface. China aims to land its own astronauts at the moon’s south pole by the next decade. Begun in 2004, China’s lunar exploration program, Chang’e — named after the Chinese goddess of the moon — has seen fast progress. It “is very systematic, very well done, and they’ve been successful every step of the way,” says planetary geologist James Head of Brown University in Providence, R.I.</p>



<p>In 2018, China put a relay communication satellite in orbit around the moon. In 2019, China landed a rover on the lunar farside, providing the first up-close view of the side of the moon hidden from Earth. That rover is still operating. In November 2020, China sent another rover, which brought samples from the moon’s nearside to Earth the following month.</p>



<p>Next up, although China doesn’t share its specific schedule plans, is Chang’e 6, which will collect and return material from the moon’s farside. In 2026, China intends to launch its Chang’e 7 mission to the south pole to search for water ice. “There’s no question,” Head says, “that [China] will be sending humans to the moon toward the end of the decade.”</p>



<p>China’s human-occupied space station, called Tiangong, is now complete and in low Earth orbit. And Mars exploration is on the menu as well. China landed a rover safely there in 2021 and is gearing up for a sample-return mission in the same time frame as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock-sample-space">NASA-European Space Agency sample-return mission</a> to Mars.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_artemis_tiangong.jpg" alt="illustration of China’s Tiangong space station with earth in the background" class="wp-image-3119247" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_artemis_tiangong.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_artemis_tiangong-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3119247">China’s Tiangong space station (illustrated) completed its final construction phase, in low Earth orbit, in early November.

<p>Science is an international endeavor, but NASA and China’s space agency <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-about-visit-uncharted-territory-moon">are unable to collaborate</a> due to the Wolf Amendment (<em>SN: 11/24/18, p. 14</em>). Tacked onto a U.S. appropriations bill in 2011, the amendment prohibits NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from collaborating, designing and planning projects with China, unless authorization is granted by the U.S. Congress.</p>



<p>Some lunar scientists, however, hope there can be collaboration between the two nations, such as sharing returned samples. “There are a lot of different places to go in space, and there’s no sense duplicating everything,” Head says.</p>



<p>While human space exploration began as a competition, international collaboration is now the norm. Astronauts from 20 countries have visited the International Space Station over its 22-year history, living together for months and working toward shared interests.</p>



<p>“The International Space Station is a frigging United Nations in orbit in a tin can,” Head says. Private firms also have become increasingly involved in the ISS. And for the Moon to Mars program, international space agencies and private companies are participating, designing and fabricating crucial components.</p>

<h4>To the south pole</h4>



<p>When humans step on the moon again, they’ll investigate a never-before-explored locale, the moon’s south pole. It’s a region rich with impact craters, uplifted ancient material and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-crash-reveals-crater-held-water">water ice</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/09</em>). Both the United States and China are targeting this area to answer new research questions and to access resources humans would need for an extended stay.</p>



<p>This cratered terrain reveals when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-took-multibillion-year-beating">rocky material tore through the&nbsp;solar&nbsp;system</a> in the first billion years of its history, slamming into the nascent planets (<em>SN: 4/25/12</em>). Earth no longer tells that history, but the moon, without liquid water or a robust atmosphere to smooth away the evidence<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-019-0622-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">, retains a surface record of meteorite impacts</a> over billions of years. “Because that record is so perfectly preserved on the lunar surface, it is the single best place in the entire solar system to understand the origin and early evolution of planets,” says planetary scientist David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.</p>



<p>And while those are important mysteries, the south pole’s deep craters also hold something thrilling — water ice. There’s a lot to learn about that ice, says lunar exploration scientist Clive Neal of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. How much is there? Can it be extracted? How to refine it for human use? The Artemis explorers can address those questions, which would enable even longer-term exploration.</p>



<p>That’s the goal this time around: to stay longer for both science exploration and to learn how humans can have a lasting presence on another celestial body. This work “would extend the bounds of human experience in a way that has never happened before,” the Smithsonian’s Muir-Harmony says.</p>



<p>That’s a tall order, considering how NASA’s schedules keep slipping and the cost estimates for each piece of Moon to Mars keep ballooning. A 2021 audit estimates that by the end of 2025, the cost for the Artemis program will reach $93 billion, some $25 billion over NASA estimates.</p>



<p>These next few years of Artemis flights will show what NASA can do. And China’s upcoming missions will show what that nation’s lunar exploration can achieve. The world will be watching both.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/11/15/laser-scanners-by-william-benner/">“Laser Scanners” by William Benner</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/williambennerjr?lang=en">William Benner</a> is a scanner enthusiast and the president of the company <a href="https://pangolin.com/">Pangolin</a>. His company sells equipment mostly for laser shows but also for other applications. Some years ago, he wrote a book on &#8220;Laser Scanners&#8221;, which is available through <a href="https://laserscanningbook.com/">this website</a> but can also be received as pdf via <a href="https://laserscanningbook.com/Register/">request</a> (or directly as <a href="http://download.pangolin.com/_Files/LASER_SCANNERS_Book-unlocked.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an interesting read also for microscope builders. The book is not too technical but offers inspiration or ideas also for more experienced scan system designers.</p>



<p>For example, the book covers the basics of different scan systems, ranging from galvo scanners, resonant scanners, acousto-optic scanners, MEMS scanners, and others. However, the main focus is on galvo scanners, how they are built, controlled, and what can be done with them.</p>



<p>One chapter that I found the most interesting (naturally, because of <a href="https://opg.optica.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-5-1656">my own work on z-scanning</a>), is chapter 14, &#8220;Scanning in the third (focus) dimension&#8221;. The retroreflector approach is really cool!</p>



<p>The beam path designs shown in chapter 15, &#8220;Scanner blanking&#8221;, are quite inspiring, not only for blanking a beam but also for other applications. For example, one scan beam path designs from this book had been re-invented as the so-called <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewGYork/status/1480400705026347008">scandreas</a> for light sheet microscopy.</p>



<p>Chapter 16 suggests<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens"> wide-angle</a> scan lenses, which made me think about the potential use of such a concept for microscopy, maybe together with scan devices that scan very fast but only at a tiny optical angle. It would be interesting to simulate and optimize such a beam path (and then probably understand all the reasons why it would not work for microscopy).</p>



<p>Anyway, check out the book. It&#8217;s a colorful mix of technical manual, advertisement for his own company and some pieces of entrepreneurial advice. There are some explanations that could be improved (for example the chapter on scan lenses), but that&#8217;s okay. The book is an easy to read, avoids jargon and describes some interesting ideas that I for example was not aware of before &#8211; useful!</p>

<p>In addition to being a cause for celebration, “the 8 billion milestone also brings important responsibilities, and highlights related challenges for social and economic development and environmental sustainability,” said Maria-Francesca Spatolisano, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for policy coordination and inter-agency affairs, at <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1q/k1qpc2kwlf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a news conference</a> in July.</p>





<p>Though the global population continues to expand, the rate of growth is slowing. Current projections predict the world’s population will peak at about 10.4 billion in the 2080s and remain steady until 2100. Previously, the U.N. had predicted that the world’s population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, based on the rate of population growth in 2017.</p>



<p>In the coming decades, migration is expected to be the sole driver of population growth in high-income countries, according to the <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2022_summary_of_results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Population Prospects 2022 report</a>, released by the U.N. in July. What’s more, the populations of 61 countries are projected to decrease by 1 percent or more between now and 2050. In lower-income countries, population growth is expected to still be driven by more births than deaths.</p>

<h3>Population projections</h3>



<p>The global population is expected to peak at about 10.4 billion in the 2080s and then level off until the end of the century, according to these projections from the United Nations. The red line is the median of many projections (some shown in gray), each computed by varying factors such as fertility and mortality rates around the world.</p>

<p>“There is inherent uncertainty in population projections,” said John Wilmoth, director of the U.N. Population Division, at the July news conference. This uncertainty, he said, is in part due to the possible range of trajectories of birth rates, mortality rates and emigration across various countries.</p>



<p>While rapid population growth in developing nations may intensify climate disasters, Spatolisano said, it’s important to keep in mind that “more developed countries — whose per capita consumption of material resources is generally the highest — bear the greatest responsibility for implementing strategies to decouple human activity from environmental degradation.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clam-presumed-extinct-found-alive">A clam presumed extinct for 40,000 years has been found alive</a></h4>

              
                <p>A species of clam is back from the dead.</p>



<p>Known as <em>Cymatioa cooki</em>, the clam had only ever been found as a fossil, and scientists presumed that the species had been extinct for more than 40,000 years. Then, while scouring tide pools for sea slugs off the coast of California in 2018, marine ecologist Jeff Goddard spotted something unfamiliar: a white, translucent bivalve roughly 11 millimeters in length.</p>



<p>Not wanting to disrupt the clam, Goddard, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, photographed it and shared the images with a colleague. Paul Valentich-Scott, curator of malacology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, didn’t recognize the marine critter either, which made him happy. “New discoveries are part of why we’re in science,” Valentich-Scott says.</p>

<p>The pair finally captured a live specimen in 2019 and brought it back to the museum to compare with known species from the fossil record. It bore a striking resemblance to a fossil bivalve first described in the 1930s by paleontologist George Willett.</p>



<p>Willett named the species after Edna Cook, an amateur shell collector who recognized the fossil as being unique among a collection of more than 30,000 shells.</p>





<p>“Once I physically saw that original specimen that Willett had used for his description, I knew right away” that the live clam was the same species, Valentich-Scott says.</p>



<p>The researchers still puzzle over how the critters eluded science for so long. One idea is that <em>C. cooki</em>’s preferred habitat is farther south in Baja, Calif., perhaps in a remote area. A mass of warm water may have washed some clam larvae toward Santa Barbara. So far, Valentich-Scott and Goddard have found at least two, and potentially four, of the living clams.</p>



<p><a></a>“It’s rare to find something first as a fossil and then living,” says David Jablonski, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/95139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triumphant reappearance</a><em> </em>of <em>C.</em> <em>cooki</em>, described November 7 in <em>ZooKeys</em>, places the clam among a group of apparently back-from-the-dead creatures dubbed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/back-dead">the Lazarus taxa</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/07</em>). Even with the vast array of animal specimens available to modern scientists, Jablonski says, “there’s always more to find.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/11/how-do-researchers-really-feel-about-methods-sharing/">How do researchers really feel about methods-sharing?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Written by Lindsay Morton</p>



<p></p>



<p>In scientific communications, methods are finally getting their due. Tools for better-communicating methods are everywhere these days&mdash;from new reporting standards and methods-specific article types, to dedicated methods journals and purpose-built repository platforms. But so far, no single solution has enjoyed wide adoption or been generally acknowledged as best practice.</p>



<p>Now, new data gathered by PLOS, with the support of <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> and <a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/">TCC Africa</a>, sheds light on how researchers view methods, and lends insight into their motivations and behaviors when it comes to methods-sharing. Over 1,000 researchers completed the survey. Respondents were concentrated primarily in the Life and Health Sciences, and tended to be more senior in their careers. Read on for highlights, or skip straight to the <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/7jxav">preprint for in-depth details</a>.</p>



<h3>Takeaway #1 &ndash; Established methods-sharing norms are insufficient</h3>



<p>Researchers report that, in general, for articles in their field, the information contained in research article methods sections is <strong>only moderately adequate</strong> for evaluating findings, and <strong>inadequate </strong>for reproduction and reuse. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>Only 74% of respondents reported that the methods section alone is usually adequate to <strong>evaluate </strong>the findings of the article.</li><li>Only 42% reported that the methods section is usually adequate to <strong>reproduce </strong>results.</li><li>And 47% that it is usually adequate to <strong>reuse or extend</strong> the method in a different context.</li></ul>

<h3>Takeaway #2 &ndash; Researchers see methods sharing as important</h3>



<p>Researchers care about methods-sharing. Nearly all respondents (95%) rate sharing novel methods as important or highly important. A majority (60%) rate methods-sharing as important even if the methods themselves are straightforward and widely used.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="445" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs-1024x445.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20948" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs-1024x445.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs-300x130.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs-768x333.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-share_piechart-image_blogs.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Takeaway #3 &ndash; When it comes to their specific goals, researchers aren&rsquo;t satisfied</h3>



<p>Researchers were asked to rank specific reasons or goals for methods-sharing in two ways:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Importance of the goal</li><li>Satisfaction with their own ability to achieve the goal</li></ul>



<p>In general, goals relating to <strong>usability </strong>of methods are of <strong>paramount importance</strong> to researchers, and satisfaction with their ability to achieve this is moderate. Goals relating to <strong>access </strong>and availability are seen as <strong>slightly less important</strong>, but researchers also report a <strong>wider discrepancy</strong> between importance and satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="891" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-1024x891.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20964" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-1024x891.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-300x261.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-768x668.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-bar-chart-with-key-for-blogs.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Takeaway #4 &ndash; The main blockers to methods-sharing are practical</h3>



<p>A minority of respondents (33%) report having prior experience sharing methods publicly, while 56% have shared methods privately upon request. Given the high value these researchers place on methods, and their assessment of the adequacy of research article methods sections in general, we have to wonder&mdash;what&rsquo;s stopping them from sharing more?</p>



<p>The major blockers to methods sharing are practical considerations. Over a third of respondents rate the time it takes to prepare methods for public consumption (40%) and not knowing where to share (34%) as significant or highly significant blockers.</p>



<p>Of slightly less significance are concerns that sharing may not be worth their time, either because few people would use the information (30%) or because others might lay claim to their ideas (30%). Few researchers (14%) express concern about exposing their research to scrutiny or criticism.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="585" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image-1024x585.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20956" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image-1024x585.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image-300x171.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image-768x439.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Methods-blockers_blog-image.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>What do we do with this information?</h2>



<p>Reflecting on the survey, Lenny Teytelman, CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> writes, &ldquo;This is the first method-focused survey that I am aware of. When we had the idea for <a href="http://protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> a decade ago, we were acting on our intuition. It is great to see the results of the survey, validating some of our core assumptions, but more importantly, illuminating some ideas that we should be considering and trying.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s our hope that this survey and others like it can help to identify unmet needs in scholarly communications, and ultimately lead to more effective tools and best practices. We also hope that interested meta-researchers will <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_A_survey_of_researchers_methods_sharing_practices_and_priorities/21334896">dig into the data</a>, draw their own conclusions, and help to direct future research in this area.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-reads-peoples-thoughts">New brain implants ‘read’ words directly from people’s thoughts</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>SAN DIEGO</strong> — Scientists have devised ways to “read” words directly from brains. Brain implants can translate internal speech into external signals, permitting communication from people with paralysis or other diseases that steal their ability to talk or type.</p>



<p>New results from two studies, presented November 13 at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, “provide additional evidence of the extraordinary potential” that brain implants have for restoring lost communication, says neuroscientist and neurocritical care physician Leigh Hochberg.</p>





<p>Some people who need help communicating can currently use devices that require small movements, such as eye gaze changes. Those tasks aren’t possible for everyone. So the new studies targeted internal speech, which requires a person to do nothing more than think.</p>



<p>“Our device predicts internal speech directly, allowing the patient to just focus on saying a word inside their head and transform it into text,” says Sarah Wandelt, a neuroscientist at Caltech. Internal speech “could be much simpler and more intuitive than requiring the patient to spell out words or mouth them.”</p>



<p>Neural signals associated with words are detected by electrodes implanted in the brain. The signals can then be translated into text, which can be made audible by computer programs that generate speech.</p>



<p>That approach is “really exciting, and reinforces the power of bringing together fundamental neuroscience, neuroengineering and machine learning approaches for the restoration of communication and mobility,” says Hochberg, of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, and Brown University in Providence, R.I.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wandelt and colleagues could accurately predict which of eight words a person who was paralyzed below the neck was thinking. The man was bilingual, and <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10619/presentation/64105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the researchers could detect both English and Spanish words</a>.</p>



<p>Electrodes picked up nerve cell signals in his posterior parietal cortex, a brain area involved in speech and hand movements. A brain implant there might eventually be used to control devices that can perform tasks usually done by a hand too, Wandelt says.</p>



<p>Another approach, led by neuroscientist Sean Metzger of the University of California, San Francisco and his colleagues, relied on spelling. The participant was a man called Pancho who hadn’t been able to speak for more than 15 years after a car accident and stroke. In the new study, Pancho didn’t use letters; instead, he attempted to silently say code words, such as “alpha” for A and “echo” for E.</p>





<p>By stringing these code letters into words, the man produced sentences such as “I do not want that” and “You have got to be kidding.” Each spelling session would end when the man attempted to squeeze his hand, thereby creating a movement-related neural signal that would stop the decoding. These results presented at the neuroscience meeting were also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33611-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> November 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>This system allowed Pancho to produce around seven words per minute. That’s faster than the roughly five words per minute his current communication device can make, but much slower than normal speech, typically about 150 words a minute. “That’s the speed we’d love to hit one day,” Metzger says.</p>



<p>To be useful, the current techniques will need to get faster and more accurate. It’s also unclear whether the technology will work for other people, perhaps with more profound speech disorders. “These are still early days for the technologies,” Hochberg says.</p>



<p>Progress will be possible only with the help of people who volunteer for the studies. “The field will continue to benefit from the incredible people who enroll in clinical trials,” says Hochberg, “as their participation is absolutely vital to the successful translation of these early findings into clinical utility.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-dandelion-seeds-spread-wide">Why dandelion seeds are so good at spreading widely</a></h4>

              
                <p>You don’t need a dandelion to know which way the wind blows. But it can help.</p>



<p>On any given dandelion, some seeds are destined to go north, while others are fated to fly east, south or west, and every direction in between. In effect, each dandelion seed <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/G06.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is programmed to release for a wind coming from one direction</a> and resists winds from other directions, according to research to be presented at the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Indianapolis on November 20.</p>



<p>Dandelion seeds are susceptible to different wind directions depending on where they are on the seed head, says Jena Shields, a biophysicist at Cornell University. The feathery seeds on the side facing a breeze will let go most easily; the others hold on tens to hundreds of times tighter — until the wind shifts.</p>

<p>It’s a phenomenon that Shields set out to study after her adviser noticed the way dandelions responded as his toddler played with the flowers.</p>



<p>Shields measured the force it takes to pluck dandelion seeds by supergluing a fine wire to the tufted ends and pulling them from the seed heads at various angles. This seed-by-seed study mimicked what happens when wind, or a child’s breath, pushes them over. Because each seed is most susceptible to winds from distinct directions, it helps prevent seeds from all going the same way, Shields says, and may explain why the plants are so successful at spreading. Once blown off a dandelion, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dandelion-seeds-create-bizarre-whirlpool-air-fly">umbrella-like tuft on a seed carries it</a> on the breeze that pulled it away (<em>SN: 10/17/18</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But a strong, turbulent wind can still send all the seeds flying in the same direction,” Shields says, so the effect can’t guarantee that a powerful gust or exuberant child won’t blow off all the seeds at once.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/daylight-saving-time-sleep-health-science">Why daylight saving time just isn’t healthy, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Daylight saving time has ended, and most Americans have turned their clocks back an hour. My sixth-grader is in heaven.</p>



<p>At 6:50 a.m. these days, our once testy tween zombie is now … moderately awake and relatively lucid.</p>



<p>Instead of rising to gauzy predawn light, she’s got glowy morning sunshine beaming around her curtains. When she sets off for school, the sun has been up nearly a full hour. Just a 60-minute change has lightened both the morning and her mood. At breakfast today, I think I even spied a smile. </p>





<p>On November 6, every state in the United States except Hawaii and most of Arizona switched from daylight saving time, or DST, to standard time (those two states don’t observe DST). That switch shifted an hour of light from the evening to the morning. In March, we’ll move in the other direction when we “spring forward,” trading morning light for brighter evenings.</p>



<p>The United States’ biannual time change has been lighting up headlines since the U.S. Senate’s unanimous vote in March to make daylight saving time permanent. The Sunshine Protection Act would forgo turning clocks to and fro, repeating an unpopular experiment Congress tried in the 1970s and prioritizing evening light throughout the year. But the health case for staying on daylight saving time is pretty dim. And what such a shift could mean for adolescents is especially gloomy.</p>



<p>Even the name “daylight saving time” isn’t quite right, says Kenneth Wright, a sleep and circadian expert at the University of Colorado Boulder. There’s no change in the amount of daylight, he says. “What we’re doing is changing how we live relative to the sun.” When we move our clocks forward an hour, noon no longer represents when the sun is near its highest point in the sky. Suddenly, people’s schedules are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/out-sync-body-clock-causes-more-woes-sleepiness">solarly out of sync</a> (<em>SN: 10/17/16</em>).</p>



<p>That’s a big deal biologically, Wright says. Humans evolved with a daily cycle of light and dark. That sets the rhythms of our bodies, from when we sleep and wake to when hormones are released. Morning light, in particular, is a key wake-up signal. When we tinker with time, he says, “we’re essentially making the choice: Do we want to go with what we’ve evolved with, or do we want to alter that?”</p>



<p>From a health perspective, if he had to rank permanent daylight saving time, permanent standard time or our current practice of biannual clock changing, Wright says, “I think the answer is incredibly clear.” Permanent standard time is healthiest for humans, he says. In his view, permanent daylight saving time ranks last.</p>



<h4>Daylight saving time takes a toll on health</h4>





<p>Wright is not alone. As daylight saving time ticked toward its yearly end, sleep experts across the country <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/01/daylight-saving-end-standard-time-permanent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stepped out in favor of standard time</a>.</p>



<p>Scientists have linked sleep loss, heart attacks and an increased risk of dying in the hospital after a stroke to the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sleep/zsac236/6717940?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transition to daylight saving time</a>, neurologist Beth Malow wrote in <em>Sleep</em> in September. She <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Witness%20Testimony_Malow_CPC_2022.03.09.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified to that this year</a> before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee.</p>



<p>“My overall message was that permanent standard time was a healthier choice,” says Malow, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p>



<p>For both Malow and Wright, some of the most compelling studies examine U.S. time zone borders. Living on the late sunset side of a border <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629618309718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takes a toll on people’s health and sleep</a> compared with those living on the early sunset side, scientists suggested in 2019. A similar study in 2018 also found <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/27/7/719/71551/Circadian-Misalignment-and-Hepatocellular" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an increased risk of liver cancer</a> the farther west people lived within a time zone, where the sun rises and sets later in the day.</p>



<p>But the downsides of nighttime light are not always crystal clear. A November study, for example, suggested that year-round daylight saving time would reduce <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deer-vehicle-collisions-daylight-saving-time">deer-vehicle collisions</a> <em>(SN: 11/2/22)</em>. But studies like these can be hard to interpret, Malow says. Other factors may come into play, like deer’s seasonal activity and changing roadway conditions. “The car-crash literature has been so mixed,” she says. “I’ve seen stuff come out on both sides.”</p>



<p>She points to a study in <em>Time &amp; Society</em> in June which found that people on the western edge of a time zone had <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0961463X221104675?journalCode=tasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more automobile fatalities</a> than their easterly neighbors. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dark mornings and light evenings mean people’s body clocks don’t line up with the sun. That mismatch can hamper sleep, making for drowsy drivers, which may factor into collisions, Malow says. In the evenings, if “there’s still light in the sky, it messes with our brains.”&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A sleep doctor’s tips for getting more Zs</h3>



<p>For anyone struggling with sleep — whether during standard time or daylight saving time — Sonal Malhotra of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston has a few suggestions for ways to get a more restful night.</p>



<ul><li>Try to wake up to morning sunshine.</li><li>Keep a consistent sleep schedule, waking up and going to bed around the same time every day (even on weekends).</li><li>Keep a consistent meal and exercise schedule.</li><li>Avoid afternoon naps.</li><li>Avoid afternoon caffeine.</li></ul>
</div>



<h4>Morning light wakes up the brain</h4>



<p>The brains of teens and tweens are even more vulnerable, Malow says. When kids go through puberty, the brain waits an hour or two longer to release melatonin, the “hormone of darkness,” which tells the bodies of kids and adults alike that it’s time to go to sleep.</p>



<p>Bedtime can be tough for older kids because, physiologically, they’re just not as sleepy as they used to be. And as I’ve learned with my daughter, if you throw early school start times in the mix, rising and shining can be even harder.</p>



<p>“I have a middle schooler, too. It’s brutal,” says Lisa Meltzer, a pediatric sleep psychologist at National Jewish Health in Denver. Some U.S. school districts are making changes that might make mornings easier. This year, most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/us/california-later-school-start-times.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high schools and middle schools in California debuted later start times</a>. Five years ago, Meltzer’s school district embarked on a similar experiment. What they learned can teach us how older kids might fare if daylight saving time were to stay put year-round, Meltzer says.</p>



<p>In 2017, the Cherry Creek School District in suburban Denver flipped middle and high schools’ early start times with elementary schools’ later ones. The change didn’t much affect younger kids, who still started class well after sunrise, at 8 a.m., says Meltzer, who presented the science behind changing school start times to her school board. But older kids, who started school at 8:20 a.m. or 8:50 a.m., noticed a big difference. They slept more at night and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945722000053" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tended to function better during the day</a>, Meltzer’s team reported most recently in the February <em>Sleep Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>“The number one thing [high-schoolers] said was how much they liked going to school when it was light out,” she says.</p>



<p>And it wasn’t just the students. Their teachers, too, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/josh.13254" target="_blank" rel="noopener">felt the benefits of later start times</a>, Meltzer and colleagues report November 6 in the <em>Journal of School Health</em>.</p>



<p>Morning light is crucial for keeping people’s bodies on schedule, Meltzer says. With permanent daylight saving time, kids will not have the same eye-opening, brain-wakening, a.m. sunshine. “We need morning sunlight to keep our internal clocks on track,” she says. “I cannot emphasize this enough.”</p>



<p>So far, the Senate’s plan for year-round daylight saving time has seemed to stall, so the prospect of an everlasting shift toward evening light doesn’t look bright. But come March, when daylight saving time begins anew, we’ll have to adjust again.</p>



<p>For kids struggling with sleep, Sonal Malhotra, a pediatric pulmonologist and sleep doctor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, has some tips. Consistency is key, she says: regular sleep, meal and exercise schedules. And when waking up, she adds, “make sure you have bright light.” Malhotra also recommends avoiding afternoon naps and caffeine.</p>



<p>I don’t know if my daughter will ever be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in the mornings (I’m not), but when mornings eventually get darker, Malhotra’s advice may give us something to fall back on.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-why-covid-19-hits-differently">DNA is providing new clues to why COVID-19 hits people differently</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, the mercurial nature of the coronavirus has been on display. Some people get mild, cold-like illnesses or even have no symptoms when infected, while other people become severely ill and may die from COVID-19.</p>



<p>What determines that fate is complicated and somewhat mysterious. Researchers are looking at a wide variety of factors that may play a role — everything from demographics to preexisting conditions to vaccination status and even genetic clues.</p>





<p>Researchers know that older people are more likely to have severe complications of the disease. The unvaccinated, too, have an increased risk of hospitalization and death compared with people who have gotten their COVID shots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unvaccinated people age 50 and older were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#rates-by-vaccine-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 times as likely to die</a> from COVID-19 as vaccinated people who had gotten two or more booster shots, August data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate. For instance, among the unvaccinated there were 5.46 deaths per 100,000 people on August 28, compared with 0.49 per 100,000 for those with two-plus boosters.</p>



<p>Even among the vaxxed the number of shots counts. That same month, people 50 and older who got their first two shots and only one booster were nearly three times as likely to die (1.27 deaths per 100,000) as their peers who got two or more boosters.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Preexisting health problems</h4>



<p>A litany of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#underlying-med-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health conditions</a>, including heart disease, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes and obesity, increase the risk of bad outcomes from COVID-19 at any age. Yet some types of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-asthma-allergic-immune-response">asthma may protect </a>against the disease (<em>SN: 5/2/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer patients are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. But even among cancer patients, some people are more vulnerable than others.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2797979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cancer patients who are immunosuppressed</a>, either because of problems with their immune systems or because they are taking immune-dampening drugs, are more likely to get severe COVID-19, die or develop cytokine storm — a whirlwind of immune chemicals that can set off tissue- and organ-damaging inflammation, researchers report November 3 in <em>JAMA Oncology</em>. The effect was worse for immunosuppressed people who were getting immunotherapy for cancer, compared with people getting other chemotherapies or no treatment.&nbsp;</p>





<p>That means cancer patients with weakened immune systems “should be very careful and adopt strict measures to prevent them from catching COVID-19,” says study coauthor Chris Labaki, a cancer researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</p>



<p>“Wear masks as much as possible, clean everything, including washing your hands. Maybe don’t go to crowded public places where the chance of catching COVID-19 might be higher.” People who have cancer patients in their lives may also want to take more care to avoid the coronavirus, he says.</p>



<h4>Genetic clues</h4>



<p>But young and otherwise healthy people may get really sick, be hospitalized or even die from COVID-19 too. It’s hard to predict who might succumb, but researchers are searching for genetic clues.</p>



<p>Some studies have found that versions of<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-some-neandertal-genes-protection-severe-covid-19"> genes inherited from Neandertals may protect against COVID-19</a>, while other genetic heirlooms passed down from Neandertals can<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-neandertal-genes-risk-severe-infection"> up the risk of severe disease</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21; SN: 10/2/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A massive international study examining DNA from more than 28,000 COVID-19 patients and almost 600,000 people who hadn’t been infected (to the best of their knowledge) confirmed that inheritance from Neandertals is involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.</p>



<p>The study also confirmed a previous finding that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-how-dna-genetic-risk-infection-severe-illness">people with type O blood may have some protection against getting infected</a> with the coronavirus (<em>SN: 7/8/21</em>). Exactly what accounts for the protection is still not known.</p>



<p>People with rare variants in a gene called toll-like receptor 7, or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010367" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TLR7</em>, are 5.3 times more likely to get severe COVID-19</a> than those who don’t have the variants, the team also reported November 3 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>. Biologically, the link makes sense. <em>TLR7</em>’s protein is involved in signaling the immune system that a virus has invaded. Part of its duties include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">marshaling interferons</a>, immune system chemicals that are some of the first responders to viral infections (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). Interferons warn cells to raise their antiviral defenses and help to kill infected cells.&nbsp;</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>A gene called <em>TYK2</em> is involved in producing some interferons. Genetic variants in that gene raise the risk of developing lupus, but may<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010253" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> protect against coronavirus infection</a>, researchers report in a separate study also published November 3 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>. While riling up interferons may fend off the coronavirus, when there is no virus to combat, the immune system may damage the body with friendly fire, producing lupus or other autoimmune diseases. Such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-death-immunity-gene-crohns-disease-health">genetic trade-offs</a> are common (<em>SN: 10/19/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evidence links many other genes to COVID-19 outcomes, multiple large studies have found. Some of those findings may hint at drugs that could better treat the disease.</p>



<h4>Individual risk</h4>



<p>But the problem with all of these studies is that they can’t tell any individual what their chances are of a bad outcome from catching COVID-19. For instance, the DNA testing company 23andMe tells me that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/consumer-genetic-testing-dna-genome">I have less than 2 percent Neandertal DNA</a> (<em>SN: 5/22/18</em>). I don’t know whether that includes the variants that would make me more susceptible to severe disease or the ones that protect against infection. What if I got both? And how does that play with my blood type and all the other genetic variants I may carry?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then you have to factor in your age, your health, your environment. Let’s face it, that last one is probably the most important. For instance, if you have a job that exposes you to multiple people, you’re at higher risk of getting COVID-19 than someone who works from home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s nothing you can do about the genetic hand you’re dealt (at least not until gene editing is perfected). Many experts I talk to say that improving indoor air in public buildings is what is really needed to avoid infection. That’s also out of most people’s hands. But there are still things you can do to lessen your risk. Labaki’s advice to cancer patients — mask, avoid crowds, wash your hands — plus staying up-to-date on vaccinations is good for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
