<p>A professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in Iraq has been steadily racking up retractions since 2022, with reasons ranging from<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-022-04150-z"> authorship manipulation</a> to<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838822026755"> </a><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/14/6/706">irrelevant citations</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838822026755">peer review-by-author</a> and<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13098-023-01008-x"> not providing study data</a> upon request.</p>



<p>Yasser Fakri Mustafa, who is also dean of the College of Pharmacy at the University of Mosul and editor-in-chief of the <a href="https://ojs.uomosul.edu.iq/index.php/iphr/"><em>Iraqi Journal of Pharmacy</em></a>, now has at least <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dyasser%2bfakri%2bmustafa">16 retractions</a> to his name, and more are likely to follow. One publisher told us it is actively investigating Mustafa’s work, and 81 of his<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mFg4hnMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"> more than 500 papers</a> have been<a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+yasser+fakri+mustafa"> flagged on PubPeer</a>.</p>



<p>From 2008 to 2019, Mustafa published no more than one or two articles a year, and often he had no output at all, according to the research database Dimensions. Then his output rose sharply, peaking at 120 in 2022, according to Dimensions. That same year, however, the researcher’s name appeared in a blog post by <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/18/nick-wise-sleuth-publisher-taylor-francis/">Nick Wise</a> and Alexander Magazinov about<a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/10/19/the-incredible-collaborations-of-renaissance-men-and-women/"> authorship-for-sale networks</a>. The two sleuths had found several papers by Mustafa and a slew of international coauthors that matched authorship ads on various websites, including that of a<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/6AE5E1D8F499A70016850496C5782F/#2"> Russia-linked</a><a href="https://science-publisher.org/"> paper mill</a> in Latvia, as<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D2243EB87ACCC44E03572F8EB865A5"> they</a><a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/D39C28DF6FD174FF2CD3D26615E113"> documented</a> on PubPeer.</p>



<span id="more-132752"></span>



<p>An<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W9Gy4Msd9rgOHtmZdvKO-pDWeGxl8NTfikDMpQ_ywCc/edit?gid"> online list of other works</a> that match ads found on the Latvian paper mill’s website includes several articles by Mustafa that have not been retracted.</p>



<p>At least one of the dean’s retractions is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960122002274?via%3Dihub">explicitly linked to a PubPeer post</a> that shows a Facebook ad selling authorship of the paper. The retraction notice states the study was submitted by a single author in Iran and that the other authors, including Mustafa, were added during a revision of the manuscript.</p>



<p>Mustafa’s coauthors on the retracted papers include at least <a href="https://somounv.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A/">two</a> <a href="https://alayen.edu.iq/news/details/3757">former</a> Iraqi university presidents. One of them, Shafik Shaker Shafik, whose article was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838823000440">pulled in 2023 for authorship and peer-review manipulation</a>, <a href="https://en.alayen.edu.iq/news/details/3760">now heads the country’s Scientific Research Commission</a>, an organ under the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to our questions, Mustafa focused on three retractions in Frontiers journals that provided little detail beyond stating that an investigation had found a “serious breach of our authorship policies and of publication ethics.”</p>



<p>“In all three cases, the retractions were due to administrative and procedural concerns related to author order and not due to any academic misconduct, data falsification, plagiarism, or ethical violations,” Mustafa told us. “The research methodologies, results, and conclusions remain valid and scientifically sound.”</p>



<p>Mustafa’s statements echoed assertions by Haider Al-Aboudi, spokesperson for Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, who said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soRbv6QQB_Y">a recent news program</a> (in Arabic) the University of Mosul’s retractions were for “procedural reasons” rather than “issues of research integrity or ethics.” Of the 19 retractions the institution has earned since 2022, all but three are Mustafa’s, according to the Retraction Watch Database.</p>



<p>Citing confidentiality, Frontiers would not share information about the nature of the ethics and authorship violations it had found. But a spokesperson told us, “When investigations raise concerns, we engage with authors as well as their institutions and share relevant findings to support further review or action.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mustafa’s other retractions – in journals from publishers such as Elsevier, MDPI, Wiley, Springer Nature and Taylor &amp; Francis – offer much more detail.</p>



<p>An Elsevier journal, for instance,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838822026755"> described how</a>, “In addition to manipulation of the list of authors, acceptance of this article was partly based upon the positive advice made by a reviewer that had conflict of interest. That reviewer contributed substantively to the preparation of both the original and revised manuscripts without disclosing their involvement to the editor.”</p>



<p>And a Springer Nature journal<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13098-023-01008-x"> noted</a> “the authors have not provided the underlying data on the editor&#8217;s request. Additionally, the authors have not been able to provide documentation that ethical approval was obtained prior to commencing this study. The ethics approval number as stated in this article appears to be identical to an ethics approval number in a previously published article by some of the same authors.”</p>



<p>Mustafa declined to comment on these retractions, and his institution did not reply to repeated requests for comment.</p>



<p>But an academic at the institution told us the problems with Mustafa’s work had caused concern among several of his colleagues. “The damage to the university of Mosul is evident,” said the academic, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frontiers told us it had concluded its investigation into Mustafa’s papers, but Taylor &amp; Francis said it was “independently investigating concerns raised about a number of articles” by the dean.</p>



<p>Despite his growing number of retractions, journals continue to publish Mustafa’s papers at a brisk clip. More than 20 of his articles have appeared in Springer Nature journals since the company’s latest<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-025-36199-5"> retraction of one of his works</a> on March 6, for example.</p>



<p>We asked Springer Nature whether it was currently investigating Mustafa’s work and how it deals with authors who have had several articles retracted for serious ethics breaches. The publisher said it would get back to us, but after two weeks still has not provided comments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>All PLOS journals place a premium on scientific rigor and editorial integrity. We publish research that complies with the highest technical and ethical standards, and makes a meaningful contribution to our shared knowledge. To ensure that we achieve these priorities against an ever-changing publishing landscape, we work closely with our communities to develop and adapt our editorial standards, implementing new checks and workflows as needed to centre editorial excellence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of this work, we recently updated the standards against which we evaluate research using publicly available health and social science databases. When conducted rigorously, these studies are important for understanding prevalence and generating hypotheses for future projects. However, the datasets can <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003152">also be misused</a> for research that lacks a legitimate research question and does not make a contribution to the literature. Data dredging and &ldquo;salami slicing&rdquo; &ndash; whereby studies with closely related research questions, methods and/or results are divided into separate manuscripts to boost publication output &ndash; are particular concerns with these studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address these concerns, journal teams are working in concert with Academic Editors to ensure that all submissions meet common standards around the research question and the age of the dataset. In addition, per our long-standing guidelines, authors who wish to publish their observational studies in any PLOS journal should submit a <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/">STROBE checklist</a> alongside their manuscript.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for being part of the PLOS community and supporting our efforts to publish research that is robust, reliable and accessible to all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/09/04/updated-submissions-statistics-now-available-in-arxiv-membership-dashboards/">Updated submissions statistics now available in arXiv membership dashboards</a></h4>

              
                <p>September is here, and so are the updated arXiv membership dashboards!</p>
<p>arXiv is always free to read and free to submit to &#8211; but not free to operate. We are so incredibly grateful to our members who choose to give to arXiv every year. <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/membership.html">arXiv membership is a flexible way to support arXiv</a> and is available to universities, libraries, labs, and research institutions who appreciate the value arXiv provides to their researchers and want to help keep science free, accessible, and open for all. arXiv currently has over 200 members, and their support makes up over 60% of the arXiv operating budget.</p>
<p>In appreciation, arXiv offers a customized dashboard as a benefit of membership, which shares institution-specific usage data based on submissions over a three year period, including a subject category breakdown. These dashboards are updated annually, and we&#8217;re happy to report that the 2025 dashboards (which cover data from the years 2022, 2023, and 2024) are live!</p>
<p><strong>The Membership Dashboards &#8211; what&#8217;s new (besides the data)?</strong></p>
<p>arXiv has been providing submission data to our members since it was first requested in 2021 &#8211; our membership program is even <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/06/02/membership-program-submissions/">based on institutional submission data</a>! We&#8217;ve recently made some changes both to how we present the data and how we collect this data to improve transparency, accuracy, and the member experience.</p>
<p>At the end of 2024, we updated the membership dashboard and how it is accessed. Previously, members were sent a password-protected link with an updated dashboard. Now, members must create an arXiv account to access their dashboard. This update was implemented to make the dashboards more secure and easier to share with colleagues, as well as allowing arXiv to more easily add different features to the dashboard as member data needs change. Member representatives are invited by email to create an arXiv account and access their dashboard &#8211; when the dashboard is update, a reminder email is sent. <strong>Haven&#8217;t received your invite email or having trouble accessing your new dashboard? </strong>Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2025, arXiv now collects, analyzes and presents our member submission data in-house. Over the years, arXiv has employed several different methods to parse institutional submission data. In 2021, we tracked and shared this data using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). In 2022, when MAG was deprecated, submission data was provided by <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus">Scopus</a>, the curated abstract and citation database operated by Elsevier. From 2022 to 2024, Scopus used <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html">arXiv’s open APIs</a> to collect and process the data, and returned it to arXiv to share with members. Scopus generously provided this service free of charge.</p>
<p>While the exact methodology may evolve over time, arXiv&#8217;s current approach to the data relies on detecting institutional affiliation from macros in the LaTeX source and other metadata. It is our hope that bringing the institutional affiliation detection in-house will allow us to better address member institutions&#8217; questions about data accuracy, transparency, and availability, and enable arXiv to evolve the data collection and reporting process to support our member institutions&#8217; needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why share this data?</strong></p>
<p>arXiv is a community-supported and community-led resource, and we believe sharing our data with the highest possible accuracy and full transparency is key to helping members and arXiv users understand how arXiv is being used and bringing value to the scientific community.</p>
<p>For the members who support arXiv, the dashboards help institutions build a more holistic picture of the research activities taking place across their institutions. Members will be better able to track changes in their institution’s research outputs posted to arXiv, identifying arXiv usage in different subject categories over time. For institutions, particularly librarians, this level of detail helps them to understand and report on progress towards open access and other key strategic goals. Importantly, arXiv helps institutions fulfill their mission of expanding access to scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>What other data does arXiv share?</strong></p>
<p>While the customized dashboards are only for active members, arXiv does share other data publicly. For those interested in a general overview of submissions by institution, arXiv maintains a ranked list of all organizations who use arXiv, with their average total of submitted papers <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/reports/2024_institution_submissions.html">here</a>. This list is updated annually at the same time that membership dashboards are updated.</p>
<p>arXiv also shares statistics on hourly usage rates, monthly submissions, monthly downloads, and submissions by subject <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/main">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made quite a few changes to the way we present user submission data, so if you&#8217;ve got questions, we&#8217;ve got answers! We&#8217;ve also updated our <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/submission_data_faq.html">Institutional Submission Data and Membership Dashboard FAQ</a> and you can always reach out to <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a> if you have questions about our methodologies or any discrepancies between data from year to year.</p>
<p>Thank you again to all our members for their support!</p>

<p>New <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines">retraction guidelines</a> from the Committee on Publication Ethics include more specific details about when to retract a paper, many of which address paper mill activity. For instance, journals should retract articles when “authorship of the publication cannot be verified or there are serious concerns about accountability for the research,” according to the updated guidance, released today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COPE also recommends retracting papers with “any form of misrepresentation,” including “deception; fraud (eg, a paper mill); identity theft or fictitious authorship; or undisclosed involvement of artificial intelligence (AI).”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The organization has also released a new, <a href="https://doi.org/10.24318/mw2J3661">separate guidance</a> for expressions of concern. Both documents reiterate the as-soon-as-possible timeframe for notices and give more specific details on what information should be included in each type of notice.</p>



<span id="more-132727"></span>



<p>COPE chair Nancy Chescheir told Retraction Watch the organization decided to update its 2019 retraction guidelines in part due to “an uptick in the number of retractions” and “concerns raised about timeliness of retractions and the process leading up to them.” However, the most significant factor was “systematic problems with the peer review process, such as paper mills,” she said.</p>



<p>Paper mill activity has markedly increased in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/04/fighting-coordinated-publication-fraud-is-like-emptying-an-overflowing-bathtub-with-a-spoon-study-coauthor-says/">recent years</a>. One way publishers correct the record when fraudulent papers make it through the peer review process is through mass retractions of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/29/frontiers-retract-122-articles-links-thousands-other-publishers-journals-to-unethical-network/">hundreds</a> or even <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">thousands</a> of papers.</p>



<p>While the prior guidelines listed “compromised or manipulated peer review process” as a reason for retraction, the new ones list specific ways the process may be compromised: “fake reviewers, paper mill use, or citation manipulation.”</p>



<p>When journals and publishers issue batch retractions for a large number of papers at once, notices should &#8220;clearly state that systematic, coordinated, and widespread manipulation of the publication process has been identified and that the article is one of a group of articles affected by the same process of manipulation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chescheir said authors who were not involved in the mass fraud might sometimes have their papers swept up in the retractions. In these cases, COPE now recommends journal editors offer the chance for the article to be “re-reviewed” before the retraction notices are published.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Like the former guidelines, the new ones include a section on timeliness of retractions, with both documents stating retraction notices should be published “as soon as possible after the editor is convinced that the publication is seriously flawed, misleading,” or otherwise unreliable. The new guidelines reiterate the point at length, and list situations that should not delay retraction, including “the authors or their institutions are not cooperative or responding promptly”, a not-yet-published letter or commentary raising “serious concerns about an article,” and “the outcome of an institutional investigation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andrew Grey, an associate professor at the University of Auckland, in New Zealand, and a sleuth who has identified many problematic papers leading to their retractions, told us this and other changes deemphasizing “reliance on institutional assessments of researcher behavior or publication integrity [are] welcome.” However, he said the guidance should “be stated more clearly” so it “is clear to journal staff that in the majority of cases, decisions about editorial action can be taken without waiting on the results of institutional assessments.”</p>



<p>But, he added, “the recommendation about timing of publication [of] retraction notices is too vague. Surely once a decision to retract is made, the notice should be published within a few weeks. Currently it can take many months.”&nbsp; Sometimes, journals and publishers <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/01/19/my-egregious-delay-science-journal-takes-more-than-three-years-to-retract-paper-after-university-investigation/">take years to start the investigation</a>, or process the retraction <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/09/17/a-universitys-three-year-battle-to-retract-papers-with-fake-data/">even after receiving an institutional investigation report</a>.</p>



<p>Chescheir said COPE did not include a specific time frame because the length of the process of deciding whether to retract an article can vary widely. However, she noted the new EOC guidelines address the need to notify readers of a potential problem earlier in the process. This document recommends that an EOC be published if an investigation or resolution of a credible concern will take “some time (eg several months).”</p>



<p>The EOC guidelines also state one should be issued “if an editor of a journal determines that concerns raised about an article are substantial and credible enough to warrant alerting readers, but insufficient information is available to decide whether a correction or retraction is required.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guidelines lay out three possible resolutions to the original preliminary notice: no changes are needed, a correction or retraction needs to be published, or the concerns were unable to be resolved. The guidelines also still allow for the EOC to be a permanent outcome, as was the case in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/22/plos-one-slaps-four-papers-with-expressions-of-concern-for-overlapping-control-data/">a recent story </a>regarding four EOCs in <em>PLOS One</em>.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/30/noticed-sleuths-are-starting-to-get-credit-for-retractions/">reported in July</a>, the revised guidelines include guidance on giving credit to sleuths and readers who raise concerns about problematic papers. “If the concerns about the article were raised by a third party, their name could be included in the retraction notice, if relevant, and with permission,” the guidelines state. As our earlier story reported, while many sleuths are in favor of this type of policy, several told us it is secondary to their goal of removing unreliable papers from the literature.</p>



<p>Retraction notices should also reference external investigations when relevant, follow <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-45-2024-crec">National Information Standards Organization best practices</a>, and not be behind a paywall or other access barriers, the revised guidelines state.</p>



<p>“Sometimes a retraction notice will just say this paper has been retracted, if you even get that much information out of it,” Chescheir said. “It is really problematic that there&#8217;s not adherence to content recommendations regarding what should be in a retraction notice, because readers need the transparency about what the problem is with the paper.”</p>



<p>To create these new guidelines, Chescheir said COPE consulted editors and publishers, conducted a literature search, and looked at publishers’ research integrity pages. She said the writing group for the updated retraction guidelines included editors, publishers, individual members, and a university and research institute member. “We don&#8217;t involve [sleuths] at the front end, but certainly we anticipate we&#8217;ll get feedback from all sorts of people who are interested in this topic,” she said. “And that would be fodder for revisions, going forward.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grey suggested including “readers with experience in assessment of publication integrity and communicating them to journals.” He also said future guidelines could provide “linked recommendations for how journals should address integrity concerns.”</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: </em><a href="https://driveinmalaysia.com/about-us/"><em>Mahmood Anwar</em></a><em> is a former business management professor of the National Research University in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. In the course of his research, he keeps an eye out for flawed articles, he told Retraction Watch. He currently mentors 10 to 15 researchers who found him through his </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChMahmoodAnwar"><em>YouTube channel</em></a><em>, where he discusses research ethics and explains study methods. In his own research, Anwar has covered topics such as </em><a href="http://www.ejst.tuiasi.ro/Files/110/2025-21-1-6-Anwar.pdf"><em>feminism in the New Testament</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://journal.sinergi.or.id/index.php/Psychology/article/view/503"><em>smartphone use and short term memory</em></a><em>. Anwar is also on the editorial board for Emerald Publishing’s </em><a href="https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/xjm"><em>VILAKSHAN &#8211; XIMB Journal of Management</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.ijmess.com/eb.php"><em>International Journal of Management, Economics &amp; Social Sciences</em></a><em>. (Neither journal is indexed in Clarivate’s Web of Science.)&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Aside from his research activities, Anwar also founded “Drive in Malaysia,” the country’s “First-ever Traffic Rules &amp; Test Site,” according to </em><a href="https://driveinmalaysia.com/"><em>the website</em></a><em>. In addition to providing road safety education, the company has an </em><a href="https://driveinmalaysia.com/independent-review-board/"><em>independent review board</em></a><em>. Anwar says the IRB was formed to approve research internally among the five members of the IRB committee, and most of the studies they review cover social sciences and road safety.&nbsp;</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While browsing the Google Scholar profile of a former colleague a few days ago, a journal with a bizarre title attracted my attention: <a href="https://zkdx.ch"><em>Zhongguo Kuangye Daxue Xuebao</em></a> (<em>ZKDX</em>). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="715" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-1024x715.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132716" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-1024x715.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-300x210.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-768x536.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10.png 1234w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Also known as the <em>Journal of China University of Mining and Technology</em>, <em>ZKDX </em>looks legitimate, with a nice web template that notes its association with a Chinese university. While browsing its archives and reading a few articles, I observed the applied quality control was not as good as the journal’s appearance. I found many structural, orthographic and analytical issues in several published articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at its indexing status, the journal appears to be <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/18264">covered by Elsevier’s Scopus</a> and ranked at Q1 as shown on <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18264&amp;tip=sid">Scimago</a> –  the highest Scopus quartile. The journal is also listed in Elsevier’s <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/products/engineering-village/databases/compendex">Compendex</a>, which is considered an authoritative database in engineering and technology. I verified its indexing status <a href="https://miar.ub.edu/issn/1000-1964">using MIAR</a>, which is a credible service offered by the University of Barcelona, Spain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="318" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-1024x318.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132706" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-1024x318.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-300x93.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-768x239.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png 1419w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>But, because Scopus <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/28/elseviers-scopus-deletes-journal-links-following-revelations-of-hijacked-indexed-journals/">removed URLs from indexed titles</a>, making it impossible to tell legitimate from fake, something seemed fishy to me. The journal offers fast-track publication, covers multidisciplinary areas, and claims to have an impact factor of 5.750 for 2024. Although any journal can calculate its impact factor, academicians generally think a journal is indexed in Clarivate’s SSCI, SCI, SCIE or ESCI if it displays this metric. I checked Clarivate’s Master Journal List and found it has not been indexed. </p>



<p>The journal is open access and charges an article processing fee of USD $120 for accepted manuscripts. But it also forces the authors to sign a copyright transfer form, which is an anomalous practice for open access journals.</p>



<p>I searched the ISSN 1000-1964, displayed on the journal’s website, on <a href="https://portal.issn.org/resource/ISSN/1000-1964">the ISSN portal</a>&nbsp; and found this ISSN was assigned to the print version of <em>Zhongguo Kuangye Xueyuan Xuebao/Journal of China Institute of Mining &amp; Technology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Observe the difference:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Zhongguo Kuangye Xueyuan Xuebao (ZKXX)/Journal of China Institute of Mining &amp; Technology</em>, versus</li>



<li><em>Zhongguo Kuangye Daxue Xuebao (ZKDX)/Journal of China University of Mining and Technology</em>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>This mismatch indicates the journal <em>ZKDX</em>, which claims to have ISSN 1000-1964, is a false-fake-imposter operation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="476" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-2-1024x476.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132708" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-2-1024x476.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-2-300x140.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-2-768x357.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-2.png 1045w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Should Scopus really index a journal whose title does not match the ISSN register and displays China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing as its publisher?</p>



<p>Another point of deception: <em>ZKDX </em>has a .ch top-level domain, presumably to convince unsuspecting authors that this journal belongs to China. However, the .ch domain is specific to Switzerland, whereas .cn is for China.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The <a href="https://zkdx.ch/editorial-board/">editorial board</a> page of this journal lists the names and affiliations of its editor-in-chief, associate editors, managing editor, and seven members of its editorial advisory and review boards. The affiliations of the rest of the board members are not provided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I searched the name of editor-in-chief Luengui Gungwu on Google Scholar and Baidu, I could not find any credible resource to identify any such person affiliated with China University of Mining &amp; Technology, Beijing, PR. China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, associate editors Junfang Xian (Chinese University of Hong Kong, PR. China), Yuan Shawn (Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou) and Yue Zhang (University of California, Davis) have no online record. I also searched for managing editors Sing Chhan (The Australian National University) and Chien-wen Kou (National Chengchi University). I believe Sing Chhan is a made-up name because I cannot find any information about them. As far as Chien-wen Kou is concerned, he is affiliated with the National Chengchi University. My source sent him an email message on June 7 to verify his affiliation with <em>ZKDX </em>but never received a response. &nbsp;</p>



<p>My sleuth contacted several editorial board members, sending verification emails to “Yuen Yuen” (real name: Yuen Yuen Ang), “Miwah Hirhono” (real name: Miwa Hirono), “Ernest Caldwel” (real name: Ernest Caldwell), Biao Xiang, Wang Lu, and Beibei Tang. My sleuth only received a response from Ernest Caldwell, provost and chief academic officer at Regent College London, who said, “Thank you for your message. I have no knowledge of the journal you reference.”</p>



<p>My sleuth also contacted Yang Ying, director of the International Cooperation and Exchange Office at China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing, and asked him to verify the editor’s affiliation with his university and if his university publishes the journal, he responded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dr. Luengui Gungwu&#8221; is a foreign teacher not a Chinese, right? I don&#8217;t think that we have such a faculty member. Which school is he working at?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From this message, we can conclude that Dr. Luengui Gungwu is not affiliated with CUMTB.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">According to ScienceDirect, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-china-university-of-mining-and-technology">the original</a> Journal of China University of Mining and Technology was renamed as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/mining-science-and-technology-china">Mining Science and Technology (China)</a> and again renamed as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-mining-science-and-technology">International Journal of Mining Science and Technology</a>. This frequent change of name and displaying the name of the journal “<em>Zhongguo Kuangye Daxue Xuebao/Journal of China University of Mining and Technology</em>,” which does not match with the ISSN record, on Scopus paved the way to successful operations of this imposter journal. The original journal <em>Zhongguo Kuangye Daxue Xuebao</em> was published by the China University of Mining and Technology, according to <a href="https://www.safetylit.org/week/journalpage.php?jid=7296">SafetyLit</a> record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe Scopus creates confusion among authors because it indexes <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100201945&amp;tip=sid&amp;clean=0">International Journal of Mining Science and Technology</a>&nbsp; and also indexes <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18264&amp;tip=sid">Zhongguo Kuangye Daxue Xuebao</a>/Journal of China University of Mining and Technology. Strangely, Scopus does not provide the journal URL, authors’ instructions, or editorial contact of the latter.</p>



<p>It seems that this imposter operation is located in India because Whois search shows IP location and ASN from India.</p>

<p>Credible and senior researchers like my former colleague published in this journal and failed to determine that this is a fake journal. Please give a thorough look to any journal’s website before article submission to avoid putting your efforts in vain.</p>



<p><em>Update, September 4, 2025: This article was updated to clarify that it </em>appears <em>that Scopus indexes the hijacked journal. Scopus does index the legitimate <a href="https://kdxb.cumt.edu.cn/">Zhongguo Kuangye Daxue Xuebao/Journal of China University of Mining and Technology</a>, which a reader cannot verify because, as the guest post author writes, &#8220;Scopus does not provide the journal URL, authors’ instructions, or editorial contact.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>A journal has retracted a study on ‘Tin Man Syndrome’ plagiarized from a decade-old April Fools’ joke —&nbsp; which the author now admits was fake.</p>



<p>On August 15, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/15/tin-man-syndrome-case-plagiarized-from-hoax-sleuths-say/">we wrote</a> about a “rare case report” published in <em>Medicine</em> in which authors claimed they had encountered a case of “ectopia cordis interna” and described an asymptomatic man with his heart located in his abdomen. Sleuths believed the case report plagiarized images from a <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/cases/april-fools-2015-ectopia-cordis-interna-tin-man-syndrome?lang=us">2015 satirical paper</a> describing a condition of the same name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A week later on August 22, <em>Medicine</em>, published by Wolters Kluwer,<em> </em>retracted the paper and five others — all published this year — with shared authors. None of the papers have been cited, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted papers are:</p>

</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2025/08220/asymptomatic_young_male_with_ectopia_cordis.120.aspx">retraction notice</a> for the ectopia cordis interna case states the authors were “unable to provide the necessary documentation, which casts doubt on the credibility of the presented case.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other notices linked above read, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Information brought to our attention during a recent investigation casts doubt on both the authorship and credibility of the presented case, and the Publisher has lost faith in the integrity of the content.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corresponding author on all six studies is Ashraf Basalilah, a researcher at Hadhramaut Hospital in Yemen. Basalilah <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Megan-Larkin-email.pdf">shared an August 21 email</a> sent to him by journal editor Megan Larkin in which she notes concerns with the other five case studies, “while not enough on their own to justify retraction, taken with the allegations above, present a pattern of submission and authorship that raises serious questions.” She then lists several concerns about authors on the papers, such as lack of public records and contact information to confirm author affiliations, outdated affiliations and incomplete author profiles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As a result of this investigation, we have concluded that we can no longer support the validity of the content submitted by the corresponding author,” Larkin continued.</p>



<p>Neither Larkin nor Maya Workowski, another editor and Wolters Kluwer, responded to our request for comment. Several emails to Medicine’s <a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/Pages/aboutthejournal.aspx">listed contact email</a> went unanswered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basalilah <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ashraf-emails.pdf">told us</a> the paper was “a trap made by someone who wants to destroy my career intentionally” and that the person in question, who Basalilah says is not a medical professional, provided the researchers with “all the case details and documentations” regarding the ectopia cordis interna case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I trusted that guy and his documentation done everything based on that, we all the authors were not involved in the patient’s care or management [sic],” Basalilah continued.</p>



<p>At the time of our first article, Basalilah provided redacted versions of what he said were the patient’s file, ethical approval paperwork, hospital and radiology department verification letter and patient consent form. He told us he couldn’t share photos of the patient’s body or face for consent reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the paper was retracted, Basalilah told us: “I admit that Ectopia cordis is not real case based on our investigation and t was faked … to destroy authors’ reputation [sic].”</p>



<p>Basalilah stood by his other five case studies, calling them “real, credible and valid.” He said he disagreed with the retractions of those five, and said the journal “has not found any mistakes or justification for retracting them.</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/a-scientist-critic-was-sued-and-won-but-did-not-emerge-unscathed-this-is-his-story/">David Sanders</a>, an image expert and biologist at Purdue University in Lafayette, Ind. who weighed in on the images in our previous story, told us from his experience, “when one finds egregious problems in one article it is probable that other articles from one or more of the authors also violate scientific norms.”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/morisky-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="250" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/morisky-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-86300" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/morisky-1.jpg 250w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/morisky-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Donald Morisky</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Two journals have retracted papers this year for unauthorized use of a controversial scale whose creator has been known to license use of the questionnaire for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/26/use-research-tool-without-permission-youll-hear/">six-figure sums</a> – and to aggressively pursue those payments from researchers he claims have misused the instrument without prior approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) is named for its creator, Donald Morisky,  now a professor emeritus in community health at UCLA. As the name implies, the measure allows researchers to <a href="https://www.moriskyscale.com/about-the-morisky-scale---mmas-4--mmas-8-the-morisky-scales.html">assess patients’ adherence</a> to drug regimens.</p>



<p>Morisky made a business out of licensing the scale and demanding steep fees for researchers who failed to obtain the proper permissions, as we reported <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/pay-or-retract-survey-creators-demands-money-rile-some-health-researchers">in <em>Science</em> in 2017</a>. Researchers who cannot afford the payments Morisky and his business associate demand have been forced to retract their work.</p>



<span id="more-132694"></span>



<p>The tool initially involved four questions but in 2008 expanded to eight. But the paper describing the longer questionnaire was <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/08/24/paper-that-helped-form-basis-of-pricy-research-tool-retracted/">retracted in 2023</a> after one critic claimed the scale was no more accurate than flipping a coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, the authors of a September 2024 paper in <em>Cureus</em> on medication adherence for patients with cardiovascular disease requested the retraction of their paper for “use of a copyrighted scale without the necessary permissions,” according to the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The corresponding author did not respond to our request for comment, but a representative from <em>Cureus</em> confirmed the retraction notice referred to the MMAS. The journal was “contacted by a representative for the scale owner who alerted us to its use in this paper without the necessary permissions,” and after speaking with them, the authors requested the retraction. The representative didn’t respond to our follow-up request regarding the identity of the person who raised the issue. <em>Cureus</em> did not answer our question regarding how much the authors were asked to pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2023 paper from <em>Journal of Arrhythmia</em> was withdrawn in July “because the authors had not obtained permission to use the MMAS-8 scale reported in the article,” according to the notice. The paper, which describes disease awareness and medication adherence in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation, has been cited once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>The journal acknowledged our request for comment but did not answer our questions regarding how they were alerted to misuse of the scale. Nihon Medical School, where the study took place, also did not respond to our email request for comment.</p>



<p>By our count, there have been at least nine retractions for licensing issues related to the MMAS. But not all retractions of papers that use the scale explicitly cite a reason in the notice, so the number is likely higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Morisky also has been known to demand researchers who license his scale make changes to publications after they appear – as was this case in this <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/pop.2018.0024">2018 article</a> by Adrienne Casebeer and her colleagues in <em>Population Health Management</em>, which was retracted several months after it appeared in print. According to the notice: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dr. Casebeer&#8217;s team obtained a license to use the MMAS-8 scale from Dr. Morisky prior to conducting the study. Nevertheless, after publication of a separate article in the Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes that also cited the MMAS-8, as the lead author, Dr. Casebeer was contacted by Dr. Morisky who requested that a number of changes be made to the article. Dr. Casebeer and her team have no desire to engage in a dispute with Dr. Morisky and therefore proactively contacted the Editor of Population Health Management and requested that the scale be removed from her published paper.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/07/journal-pulls-paper-from-ethiopia-for-unlicensed-use-of-questionnaire/">we wrote</a> about researchers who “were not aware that the Donald Morisky medication adherence tool required a fee to use.” When they attempted to reach out to Morisky, he didn’t respond, and their paper was retracted by the journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve Trubow, Morisky’s former business partner, told us he is currently policing the use of the scale after a lengthy legal struggle between the two. </p>



<p>Morisky, his family and Trubow have been playing tug-of-war over the scale – and a related “widget,” which belongs to Trubow’s company called MMAS Research LLC –  for years. In 2020, the pair  <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/02/duo-that-used-legal-threats-to-force-scientists-to-pay-for-a-tool-face-off-in-court/">faced off in court</a> over ownership of the scale, a battle which Trubow told us <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/circuit-courts/ca9/24-6568?amp">ended in a settlement</a>.</p>
