<p>Academics who publish frequently in two top business journals often have prior working relationships with the editors who handle their papers, according to a new analysis of editor-author relationships at the two publications over the last 15 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One journal editor in chief called the results “concerning,” while another thought the analysis was looking for problems on purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of the analysis, <a href="https://bit.vt.edu/faculty/directory/mindel.html">Vitali Mindel</a> of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/about/our-people/academic-staff/raffaele-ciriello.html">Raffaele Ciriello</a> of the University of Sydney in Australia, told Retraction Watch in a joint email they had set out to do a bibliometric study of “superstar” scholars in business research. The goal: “to understand the secret sauce behind exceptional productivity and success.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-133630"></span>



<p>But as they explored their data, they noticed pairs of authors and editors who supported publishing each other’s work “at striking rates.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What started as an incidental observation quickly became impossible to ignore,” they wrote. “So we decided to subject it to empirical scrutiny.”</p>



<p>For their analysis, available as a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5315585">preprint</a>, they focused on two unnamed elite business journals that disclose the identities of handling editors for published articles. Both journals make the <em>Financial Times</em>’ <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3405a512-5cbb-11e1-8f1f-00144feabdc0">list of the 50 journals</a> it uses to rank business schools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using the 1,585 peer-reviewed articles published in the two journals from 2010 through 2024, Mindel and Ciriello identified 54 academics who had each published at least 10 articles in those years. Although their combined 783 articles amounted to nearly half of all those published in the two journals in the time period, the “elite cohort” of 54 authors represented only 2.4 percent of the over 2,000 authors whose work appeared in the two journals in the study’s timeframe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mindel and Ciriello also found 90 percent of the frequently published authors had earned their Ph.D.s from North American institutions, and nearly 95 percent were men.</p>



<p>Next, Mindel and Ciriello analyzed the relationships between the 54 authors and the handling editors for each of their papers. They looked for potential conflicts of interest, such as whether the authors and handling editors had coauthored papers together, accepted each other’s articles at journals with public metadata, or had professional ties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the nearly 1,000 pairs of authors and handling editors, Mindel and Ciriello found at least half had at least one identifiable potential conflict of interest, with about 40 percent of the author-editor pairs having accepted each other’s papers. Their findings suggest editorial conflicts of interest “are not isolated anomalies but pervasive features of elite journal governance,” Mindel and Ciriello write in the preprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With some business schools offering specific rewards for publishing in top journals – including <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.357.6351.541">cash bonuses</a>, relief from teaching, and quicker promotions – academics may be incentivized to exploit editorial conflicts of interest, Mindel and Ciriello say. After posting their preprint, the pair expanded their analysis and found only two of the top 60 authors lacked apparent conflicts of interest. While the absence of evidence of conflicts of interest doesn’t guarantee none exist, “these cases show that legitimate excellence is still possible,” Mindel and Ciriello told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s not unexpected to find that who you know matters in academic publishing, Mindel and Ciriello told us they were surprised by how frequently they found editorial connections coinciding with publication in the two prestigious journals. And yet, their findings are likely “only the tip of the iceberg,” they said, because most journals don’t disclose the editors that handle particular articles.&nbsp;</p>



<p> “If patterns this strong appear in the public record, one can only imagine what remains hidden behind closed doors,” they said. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Mindel and Ciriello elected not to name the authors, editors, and journals whose work they analyzed. “Our paper doesn’t aim to point fingers but to fix systemic dysfunctions,” they told us. “Editorial conflicts of interest are not isolated lapses but institutionalised patterns of failure stemming from misaligned publication incentives.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They hope their findings encourage reforms such as more journals publishing the names of handling editors for articles, routine independent auditing of editorial conflicts of interest, or even just journals applying the policies they already have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings presented in the preprint matter because “the practices described here will lead to narrowing of the literature to reflect the views of an elite minority,” sleuth Dorothy Bishop told us in an email. Unless new scholars are connected to a member of the elite, they “will be crowded out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mindel and Ciriello also documented that studies associated with editorial conflicts of interest</p>



<p>have fewer citations. “If one takes citation as an indicator of quality,” Bishop said, “it suggests lower quality of those papers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bishop isn’t aware of any analyses of publications in other fields as detailed as that found in Mindel and Ciriello’s preprint. “The authors argue persuasively that the pattern they observed is driven by social dynamics that are universal and so you should see something similar in other fields unless specific measures are taken to counteract them,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marc Gruber, the <a href="https://www.aom.org/publications/journals/journal/journal-editorial-team/">outgoing editor-in-chief</a> of the <em>Academy of Management Journal</em>, a title on the <em>Financial Times’</em> list that publishes handling editors for articles, told us in an email he thought the preprint showed a “deliberate quest to identify some wrongdoing, and the tone can be more balanced.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gruber, a management professor at Switzerland’s Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, also said he thought the authors could have more explicitly considered the conflict of interest guidelines journals have. His journal has a “very clear, formal” policy that each editor handling a paper needs to adhere to, and he expects many others do as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kris Byron, the <a href="https://www.aom.org/publications/journals/review/review-editorial-team/">top editor</a> of the <em>Academy of Management Review</em>, which also ranks on the <em>Financial Times’</em> list and discloses handling editors, told us in an email the findings were “especially concerning” given public distrust of science and academic institutions. “Even the mere appearance of conflicts of interest weakens trust in the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If authors think the publication process at a journal is “rigged,” it discourages them from submitting their work to that journal, said Byron, a professor at Georgia State University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business in Atlanta. The primary responsibility of an editor-in-chief is to publish the highest quality papers, “which is less likely to happen when some (potentially lower-quality) papers are favored and other potentially higher-quality ones are not submitted,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is up to the EIC to set the ethical tone for the editorial team,” Byron said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has <a href="https://eugeniereichlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DFSettlementAgreement.pdf">settled a lawsuit</a> filed under the False Claims Act, admitting researchers used images and data that were “misrepresented and/or duplicated” in support of grant applications to the National Institutes of Health. Dana-Farber agreed to pay $15 million to settle the claim.</p>



<p>Sleuth <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/27/sholto-david-profile-dana-farber-retractions/">Sholto David</a> filed the claim in April 2024, about three months after he first posted about the allegations, which played a key role in Dana-Farber’s decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/health/dana-farber-cancer-studies-retractions.html">retract or correct dozens of studies</a>. Authors of some of those papers were among senior leaders of the institution, including <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp1104">president and CEO Laurie Glimcher</a>.</p>



<p>As is typical in such cases, the complaint remained sealed while the Department of Justice investigated. As part of the agreement, David will receive $2.63 million, or 17.5 percent of the settlement.</p>



<span id="more-133621"></span>



<p>“I&#8217;m very pleased with the settlement,” <a href="https://eugeniereichlaw.com/">Eugenie Reich</a>, one of the attorneys who represented David, told Retraction Watch. “And the main thing is that the lion&#8217;s share goes back to NIH and should go back out for science.” More than $8.5 million “shall constitute restitution to the United States,” according to the settlement.</p>



<p>The False Claims Act allows plaintiffs to sue on behalf of the government. Plaintiffs have been successful in cases over the past decade involving universities and other research institutions including <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/14/columbia-has-settled-a-fraud-case-for-9-5m-heres-why-thats-important/">Columbia</a>, the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/27/harvard-teaching-hospital-pay-10-million-settle-research-misconduct-allegations/">Brigham and Women’s Hospital</a>, and Duke University. Judges can award whistleblowers up to 30 percent of the settlement, although this provision of the Act has been <a href="https://www.ropesgray.com/en/insights/alerts/2025/12/the-eleventh-circuit-questions-the-constitutionality-of-fcas-qui-tam-provision?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-eleventh-circuit-questions-the-constitutionality-of-fcas-qui-tam-provision">challenged recently in courts</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typical settlements for research misconduct allegations have been in the $10 million range, although <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/13/false-claims-allegations-cost-mass-general-former-harvard-researcher-more-than-1-million/">some have been smaller</a>. As in the case of Dana-Farber, institutions often receive “credit under the Department of Justice’s guidelines for taking disclosure, cooperation, and remediation into account in False Claims Act cases.” In the Duke case, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/03/25/duke-settles-case-alleging-data-doctoring-for-112-5-million/">settled for $112.5 million</a>, the whistleblower, former lab technician Joseph Thomas, received $33.8 million.</p>



<p>The settlement is not surprising, said <a href="https://www.tzlegal.com/people/renee-brooker/">Renée Brooker</a>, a Washington, D.C.-based whistleblower attorney with Tycko &amp; Zavareei LLP who specializes in False Claims Act cases. And it’s among a growing number of fraud cases brought by the government for research misconduct associated with NIH research grants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The False Claims Act is a great watchdog, if you will, for exactly this type of fraud,&#8221; Brooker, a former assistant director for the Department of Justice in charge of False Claims Act cases, told us. &#8220;Any question brought that involves falsified or improper or inaccurate data or conclusions is important for the Department of Justice and the NIH to make an example of to deter future misconduct by any other research institutions that are getting federal money.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the Dana-Farber case is unique because of the speed at which the settlement came down, says <a href="https://www.tzlegal.com/people/eva-gunasekera/">Eva Gunasekera</a>, a whistleblower attorney also at Tycko &amp; Zavareei LLP and former DOJ senior counsel for healthcare fraud.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a really quick settlement,&#8221; she told Retraction Watch. &#8220;The case was filed in 2024. In False Claims Act-speak, usually cases take at least three years from the filing to some resolution, and usually much longer than that. I think that&#8217;s another good indication that this administration is still prioritizing much of the same kinds of fraud objectives and enforcement actions that we&#8217;ve known for the last decade plus.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reich also noted the speed. “One currency here is time. This has resolved in only 20 months. We know that research integrity disputes take a long time, and we know that False Claims Act cases take a long time,” Reich said, noting the original complaint included more than 90 papers. “And when you multiply that, this is fast.”</p>



<p>Brooker said she hoped the settlement would raise awareness among the research community about the importance of reporting fraud or false claims to the government, and the possibility of receiving a reward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that you have widespread knowledge [about this] by grantees,&#8221; said Brooker, who works with Gunasekera. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit of a different space when you&#8217;re talking about people receiving grants versus the general health care organization type-cases. [It&#8217;s] helpful to just get on the radar screen of folks who are involved in the grant community because they have this mechanism of the qui tam provisions to report fraud in a meaningful way and possibly get justice in the reward for reporting.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">David told us he first came across many of the papers listed in the lawsuit while writing a series of blog posts in <em>For Better Science</em>. After writing about Memorial Sloan Kettering researcher Sam Yoon in <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/11/01/memorial-sloan-kettering-paper-mill/">late 2023</a>, David said he eventually arrived at researchers from Dana-Farber by “following strings and strands” of coauthors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/01/02/dana-farberications-at-harvard-university/">January 2024 blog post</a>, David called out image similarities and signs of data manipulation in dozens of papers coauthored by a number of Dana-Farber affiliates. Among those were <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/william-c-hahn">William Hahn</a>, chief operating officer of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who David noted had an “impressive” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22William+C.+Hahn%22+OR+%22W+C+Hahn%22">PubPeer record</a>, including many comments about possible image issues. David also named <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/irene-ghobrial">Irene Ghobrial</a>, the senior vice president for experimental medicine, alleging there were “obvious duplications” in a bone marrow study.</p>



<p>Soon after the blog post was published, Dana-Farber requested journals retract six of the 58 studies David named and correct dozens of others, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/health/dana-farber-cancer-studies-retractions.html">the <em>New York Times</em></a><em> </em>reported<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original complaint filed in April 2024 included 95 studies by Hahn, Ghobrial, and other Dana-Farber researchers “reflecting a pattern of fraud,” the complaint read. The complaint goes on to list several grants that relied on data in some of those papers.</p>



<p>The settlement does not name specific researchers, instead referring to “Researcher 1,” the principal investigator on one set of grants in the lawsuit, and “Researcher 2,” who oversaw a second set of grants.</p>



<p>The settlement identifies 14 papers published under Researcher 1’s supervision. The senior author on 12 of the papers is <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/kenneth-c-anderson">Kenneth C. Anderson</a>, director of Dana-Farber’s LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center. Anderson has <a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?#?auth%3dKenneth%2bC%2bAnderson">10 retractions in our database,</a> dating back to 2008.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The settlement reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Researcher 1 failed to exercise sufficient oversight over these researchers in the course of their preparation of the Subject Publications and their conduct of the underlying research reported in the Subject Publications.&nbsp; As a result, Dana-Farber spent funds from the Group 1 Subject Grants that were unallowable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The settlement agreement is noting that a PI holding a grant who fails to supervise, who&#8217;s done this repeatedly and created a pattern of flawed data — not fraudulent or misconduct, but flawed data — that they should be paying more attention,” Reich said.</p>



<p>The second group of grant applications listed relied on research described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3867">a 2015 <em>Nature Medicine</em> article</a>. “Certain images and data in the Journal Article were misrepresented and/or duplicated,” the settlement reads. The senior author on that article is physician-scientist <a href="https://labs.dana-farber.org/carrascolab/people/ruben-d-carrasco-md-phd">Ruben Carrasco</a>. </p>



<p>The article received two corrections in 2024, both image related.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">An unusual aspect of the case, Reich said, was that all the pieces of the case were publicly available.</p>



<p>“Most of the evidence is public and has been in plain sight for a long time for people tenacious enough to track it all down and bring it all together,” she said. “I think often we&#8217;re playing whack-a-mole with a bad article and we&#8217;re not always seeing the patterns, and we&#8217;re not always seeing the money behind the patterns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Piecing that together is what David did, she said. “It&#8217;s a synthesis of what&#8217;s publicly available in a way that makes sense for enforcement.”</p>



<p>This was the first time David has been involved with a False Claims Act lawsuit, he told us.</p>



<p>“People might see it as an attack on universities or an attack on science,” David said. “At the end of the day, the purpose of this is, the money goes back to the NIH, and the NIH are going to spend on cancer research.”</p>



<p>“Most of the stuff that is written about does not come out in a press release like this,” he added, referring to research integrity issues. “That doesn&#8217;t make it any less important.”</p>

<p>Three years after <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/14/govt-committee-in-pakistan-lets-plagiarizing-vice-chancellor-off-the-hook/">he was let off the hook</a> by a government commission, a former university vice chancellor in Pakistan is facing sanctions for plagiarizing <a href="http://utpedia.utp.edu.my/id/eprint/21973/">a student thesis</a> in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001623612032202X">a paper</a> from 2020, Retraction Watch has learned.</p>



<p><a href="https://uog.edu.pk/faculty/mrn6572e243ad17e/muhammad-suleman-tahir">Muhammad Suleman Tahir</a>, previously of Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology, is now professor and chair of the department of chemical engineering at the University of Gujrat. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nov-20-2025-Report-on-Complaint-of-Plagiarism-against-the-VC-KFUEIT-Rahim-Yar-Khan.pdf">According to a report</a> issued on November 20 by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) in Islamabad, Tahir and his coauthors have been barred from supervising graduate students for three years and also have received a warning for their offense.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the University of Gujrat removed Tahir from his position as director of the institution’s Advanced Study &amp; Research Board on December 3, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dec-3-2025-Removal-from-directorship.jpg">according to a notification</a> we obtained.</p>



<span id="more-133616"></span>



<p>“This marks the first institutional action resulting directly from the confirmed plagiarism findings,”<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/farukh-iqbal-mieaust-cpeng-ner-rpeq-0bb3663a/?originalSubdomain=au"> Farukh Iqbal</a>, who brought the charges against Tahir, told us.</p>



<p>The case goes back to 2020, when Iqbal was working toward a doctorate in chemical engineering in Australia and noticed a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001623612032202X">paper</a> in <em>Fuel</em> that was clearly based on his master’s thesis. He alerted the journal, which <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/27/vice-chancellor-of-university-in-pakistan-loses-paper-for-plagiarizing-from-a">pulled the offending article</a> in 2021, as we reported at the time.</p>



<p>Iqbal also complained to the HEC, which found the retracted paper was based on the master’s thesis of Numair Manzoor, one of Tahir’s students. Manzoor’s thesis, in turn, was “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/14/govt-committee-in-pakistan-lets-plagiarizing-vice-chancellor-off-the-hook/">completely plagiarized</a>” from Iqbal’s, according to an expert committee convened by the HEC, as we reported in 2023.</p>



<p>Tahir argued without proof that Iqbal was the one who had plagiarized Manzoor’s work, and not the other way around. He also said he had been unaware that the paper was submitted. And he filed a 500 million rupee (~$2,800,000USD) defamation suit against Iqbal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on Tahir’s inconsistent claims of ignorance, the HEC expert committee recommended against penalizing the then-vice chancellor in February 2022. Iqbal <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Appeal.pdf">appealed</a> the decision the following month, but nothing happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, on the morning of March 13, 2023, we contacted the HEC for <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/14/govt-committee-in-pakistan-lets-plagiarizing-vice-chancellor-off-the-hook/">the story</a> we ran the following day. We heard nothing back. But that same day, the HEC constituted a new expert committee to review Iqbal’s appeal, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/July-10-2023-Report-of-Expert-Committee.pdf">according to a committee report</a> we obtained. The report, which was signed on July 10, 2023, but has not been disclosed until now, shows the committee recommended punishing all of the authors of the plagiarized paper, including Tahir. But for more than two years, the HEC did not act on these recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unaware of the committee’s decision, Iqbal complained to the Higher Education Department (HED) of the Government of Punjab, a provincial organ that has no power over the national HEC, but can ask for updates on university matters. On October 30 of this year, the HED sent a letter to the HEC inquiring about Iqbal’s appeal. The HEC’s November 20 report, which adhered to the expert committee’s recommendations from 2023, is addressed to the HED as a direct response to its request for an update.</p>



<p>“Deputy Secretary Dr. Saima Anwar [of the HED] handled the matter with exceptional integrity and ensured that my appeal – stalled for years – was finally processed,” Iqbal told us by email. “HEC disclosed the old decision and declared punishment (Minor Penalty) to all authors.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/writ-petition-1.jpg">a court document</a> he shared with us, Tahir has challenged HEC’s decision in court. He told us the case is under consideration and did not comment further.</p>



<p>But Iqbal said the court had “declined to grant any interim relief [to Tahir]. It did not suspend or stay the HEC decision; instead, it simply issued notices to the parties for a later hearing.”</p>



<p>Iqbal also noted <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A+%22Muhammad+Suleman+Tahir%22+OR+authors%3A+%22Muhammad+Bilal+Tahir%22+OR+authors%3A+%22M.B.+Tahir%22+OR+authors%3A+%22Muhammad+Sagir%22">dozens of studies</a> by Tahir and his coauthors had been flagged on PubPeer, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522012851">some</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402619319722">have</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522022317?via%3Dihub">been</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522022317?via%3Dihub">retracted</a>.</p>



<p>“The plagiarism case that triggered this process is now legally finalized by HEC, but the broader pattern of misconduct is still unfolding at the journal level,” he said.</p>
