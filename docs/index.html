              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/poop-time-capsule-andean-condor">A 2,200-year-old poop time capsule reveals secrets of the Andean condor</a></h4>

              
                <p>For over 2,000 years, Andean condors have been nesting — and pooping — in the same cliffside grotto high in the Andes. This gargantuan pile of guano is now providing an unprecedented peek deep into the birds’ past, revealing a surprising fidelity to raising chicks there even as the region changed dramatically.</p>



<p>Analyses of the deposit show that the condors overhauled their diet after European colonization of the Americas. The birds also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.0106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">practically abandoned the site</a> for a millennium, possibly thanks to centuries of erupting volcanoes, researchers report May 3 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“A material that could easily be ignored or discarded as waste can actually teach us quite a bit about how populations, communities and ecosystems respond to environmental change,” says Rachel Reid, a paleoecologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>With a wingspan of over three meters and the heft of a toddler, Andean condors (<em>Vultur gryphus</em>) &nbsp;are the largest birds of prey. Found in South America’s Andes Mountains and along the western coastline of the continent, the condors are also threatened with extinction. Only about 10,000 birds remain, and their numbers are declining.</p>



<p>Efforts to protect them hinge on understanding their behavior and ecology. But studying Andean condors can be challenging: The birds spend most of their time on the wing in remote mountain areas, which makes them difficult to capture and monitor, says paleoecologist Matthew Duda of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada.</p>



<p>But in 2014, Duda’s colleagues found a condor nest in Argentina’s Nahuel Huapi National Park, tucked in a cliffside nook that turned out to be a ripe source of information. Researchers hiked an hour from the nearest road and rappelled 10 meters down along the cliff just to reach the nest. Unlike most condor nest sites, this one was sheltered from rain and snow. Instead of washing away, the droppings of successive breeding pairs built up layer upon layer, creating a dense, pale mound.</p>



<p>Information in the preserved poo provided the “perfect opportunity for us to go back in time,” Duda says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers carved a 25-centimeter-deep slice out of the guano pile. DNA and ratios of specific chemicals in the poop hinted at what the condors ate over time. Other chemicals such as sulfur and potassium as well as preserved algae revealed changing environmental conditions.</p>



<p>Chemical dating of the samples divulged that the oldest layers in the deposit were at least 2,200 years old. That the condors were using this nest location for so long was “extremely surprising,” Duda says. Most species of birds return to the same area to raise young, but rarely the exact same nest, if ever. “If they have been using the same nest and keep coming back over and over and over again, it implies that where these birds are nesting is a super important part of their ecology and their behavior,” he says.</p>





<p>The rate at which feces accumulated slowed drastically from 1,650 to 650 years ago, dropping from 0.08 cm per year to 0.003 cm per year. That slowdown suggests condors largely left the site for a millennium, the researchers say. Around the same time, nearby volcanoes went through a volley of eruptions. Heavy ash that would have blanketed the region’s vegetation could have prompted herbivores to move away, reducing the availability of carcasses for the condors to feed on, Duda and colleagues suspect. The birds may have glided away to scavenge in greener pastures and returned to the area after the volcanic paroxysms ceased.</p>



<p>Similar connections between eruptions and declines in bird populations have previously been documented in guano records, says Dulcinea Groff, a paleoecologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie who was not involved in the new work. For instance, ancient excrement has linked dips in Gentoo penguin populations to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-nearly-snuffed-out-gentoo-penguin-colony">volcanic strife</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>4/12/17</em>).</p>

<p>The condor guano also reveals a major diet shift, Duda and colleagues say. Prior to European colonization of South America, the birds primarily scavenged the carcasses of beached whales and some native mammals like llamas and guanacos. But in recent centuries, livestock like sheep and cattle have made up the bulk of their diet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And unlike modern condors, those that lived many centuries ago didn’t have elevated lead and mercury levels in their bodies. The toxic metals can accumulate in scavengers that eat carcasses <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lead-poisoning-stymies-condor-recovery">shot with lead ammunition</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>6/26/12</em>). Scavengers excrete some of the metals in their droppings, which can then be detected by scientists. The finding helps confirm that heavy metal contamination is a recent phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research “gives us a much longer timeline to understand what the natural variability is in a population,” Duda says. Since this study is a snapshot of just one nest, he and colleagues plan on collaborating with other researchers to find similar condor nests to see whether the same patterns written in guano emerge.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the condors’ apparent loyalty to this very specific nest site — even potentially through centuries of volcanic mayhem — highlights just how crucial the preservation of such sites may be for their successful conservation, Duda says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-chemotherapy-drug-human-brain">Ultrasound allows a chemotherapy drug to enter the human brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cracking the code to brain cancer treatment might start with cracking the brain’s protective shield.</p>



<p>Nearly impenetrable walls of jam-packed cells line most of the brain’s blood vessels. Although this blood-brain barrier protects the organ from harmful invaders, it also prevents many medications from reaching the brain. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, scientists can get a powerful <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(23)00112-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chemotherapy drug into the human brain by temporarily opening its protective shield</a> with ultrasound and tiny bubbles. The early-stage clinical trial, described May 2 in the<em> Lancet Oncology</em>, could lead to new treatments for those with brain cancer.</p>





<p>Better treatments are especially needed for glioblastoma, a common and aggressive type of brain tumor. Even after surgical removal, another mass tends to grow in its place.</p>



<p>“There’s really no established treatment for when the tumors come back,” says neurosurgeon Adam Sonabend of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Patients with recurrent glioblastomas “don’t have any meaningful therapeutic options, so we were exploring new ways of treating them.”</p>



<p>After the initial tumor has been removed, patients typically receive a relatively weak chemotherapy drug that can bypass the brain’s barricade. More potent drugs could help destroy any lingering disease — if the medicines could break through the barrier.</p>



<p>Sonabend and colleagues turned to an exploratory method using ultrasound that has already succeeded at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blood-brain-barrier-jiggled-loose-deliver-medicine">briefly opening the blood-brain barrier in humans</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/15</em>). A person first receives an intravenous injection of a fluid brimming with microscopic bubbles, which fill the body’s blood vessels. This technique is already routinely used to help visualize vessels in ultrasound imaging. In the targeted brain area, ultrasound waves shake the microbubbles<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;prying open the densely packed blood vessel walls.</p>



<p>To examine safety and dosing of this delivery method and drug, 17 people had their regrown tumor removed and an ultrasound device implanted in their skull, adjacent to the remaining cavity. Patients then received between two and six rounds of treatment spaced three weeks apart.</p>



<p>During each session, participants were injected with microbubbles for 30 seconds and simultaneously received pulses of ultrasound waves for nearly five minutes. The waves reached a specific area of the brain encompassing the tumor cavity, penetrating nearly 8 centimeters deep. That was followed by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of paclitaxel, a potent drug used to treat lung, breast and other cancers. It typically can’t access the brain. &nbsp;</p>





<p>In the brain tissue zapped by ultrasound, researchers found nearly four times as much paclitaxel compared with tissue outside of range. MRI scans and a special dye revealed that the blood-brain barrier mostly closed back up within 60 minutes.</p>



<p>Overall, paclitaxel and the delivery method were well tolerated up to the maximum tested drug dose of 260 milligrams per square meter, the dose approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for breast cancer. Some patients, however, reported temporary side effects including headaches and confusion.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A fluorescent dye can enter the brain (shown) after researchers temporarily open the blood-brain barrier with ultrasound and microbubbles. That barrier is usually impenetrable for many medications, including powerful chemotherapy drugs.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“This definitely is a very interesting paradigm that can be applied not just to glioblastoma but other brain tumors,” says pediatric radiation oncologist Cheng-Chia Wu of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City who was not involved in the work. It “creates a whole host of opportunities.”</p>



<p>Although this early-stage clinical trial offers a glimmer of hope, Wu points out that it will take time to <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04528680?term=Sonabend&amp;cond=Glioblastoma&amp;cntry=US&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue testing</a> this potential treatment. But one day it could help extend glioblastoma patients’ life spans following diagnosis, which average a little over a year.</p>



<p>For now, Wu says, “this is definitely a very good first step in the right direction.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hindawi will cease publishing four journals that it identified as “heavily compromised by paper mills.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The open access publisher announced today in a <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/post/evolving-our-portfolio-response-integrity-challenges/">blog post</a> that it will continue to retract articles from the closed titles, which are <em>Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine</em>, <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em>, the <em>Journal of Healthcare Engineering</em>, and the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The closures follow <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/16/exclusive-prof-stole-former-students-identity-to-edit-two-journal-special-issues/">reporting by Retraction Watch</a> in February that a professor used the identity and email account of a former student to edit special issues of two of the journals, <em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em> and the <em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health.</em></p>



<span id="more-127039"></span>



<p>The four closed journals were also among ten Hindawi titles that sleuth Dorothy Bishop <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6mbgv">found</a> had signs of paper mill activity in their special issues. In March, the four titles were among <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/21/nearly-20-hindawi-journals-delisted-from-leading-index-amid-concerns-of-papermill-activity/">19 Hindawi journals</a> that Clarivate removed from its Web of Science index for failing to meet its quality criteria.</p>



<p>Wiley, Hindawi’s parent company, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/09/wiley-paused-hindawi-special-issues-amid-quality-problems-lost-9-million-in-revenue/">announced that month</a> that it had paused publication of special issues in Hindawi journals for three months, and subsequently had lost $9 million in revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, Wiley and Hindawi said they <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">planned to retract 1,200 articles</a> with compromised peer review, on top of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/">500 they said they would retract</a> last September.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slightly more than half of the completed or planned retractions come from these four journals, a Wiley spokesperson told us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch has tracked 81 retractions from <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dComputational%2band%2bMathematical%2bMethods%2bin%2bMedicine"><em>Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine</em></a><em>, </em>35 from <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dComputational%2bIntelligence%2band%2bNeuroscience"><em>Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</em></a>, 133 from the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dJournal%2bof%2bHealthcare%2bEngineering"><em>Journal of Healthcare Engineering</em></a><em>,</em> and six from the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?jou%3dJournal%2bof%2bEnvironmental%2band%2bPublic%2bHealth"><em>Journal of Environmental and Public Health</em></a>. Most of the retractions have come since September 2022.</p>



<p>The closed journals “have published Special Issues that have been impacted to such an extent that we feel it is in the best interest of the scholarly community to discontinue them,” Hindawi’s blog post stated. It continued:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marine-biologist-pate-endangered-rays">This marine biologist is on a mission to save endangered rays</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first time Jessica Pate swam beside a manta ray off Florida’s southern coast, the 8-foot-wide fish flipped belly-up and slowed to watch her. “I was kind of obsessed after that,” Pate says. The marine biologist was so hooked that she founded the conservation nonprofit <a href="https://marinemegafauna.org/americas/florida-manta-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Manta Project</a> and has dedicated the last seven years to studying mantas and their kin.</p>



<p>Her work is paying off. She and her colleagues have since discovered the first known manta nursery in Florida’s waters. Plus, the nonprofit launched an outreach campaign, based on surveys of local anglers, to encourage fishing practices that keep mantas safe.</p>





<p>Now Pate and her colleagues have learned that hundreds of sicklefin devil rays — an elusive cousin of mantas — also <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-marine-biological-association-of-the-united-kingdom/article/abs/multiple-datasets-confirm-range-extension-of-the-sicklefin-devil-ray-mobula-tarapacana-in-the-western-north-atlantic-ocean-off-the-eastern-usa/0D4984C41CE4C3855C694F747065525D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico home</a>, her team reports April 24 in the <em>Journal of the</em> <em>Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom</em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mantas and devil rays are both mobula rays, a genus that includes nine species, nearly all of which are listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. That’s partly because these rays have slow reproductive cycles and typically produce just one pup per pregnancy, Pate says, and partly because the animals are susceptible to injury from boat strikes or entanglement in fishing gear.<br><br>Before Pate began studying oceanic mantas (<em>Mobula birostirus</em>) off Florida, there was only one published study of sightings in the region. “There&#8217;s just so little awareness that manta rays are present,” she says. That makes instituting effective conservation measures difficult, because researchers know so little about the rays, such as population numbers or where they mate.</p>



<p>To fill knowledge gaps and raise the public profiles of manta rays in the western Atlantic, Pate conducts aerial drone surveys, gathers accounts of citizen sightings and spends countless hours tagging, tracking and measuring the creatures.</p>



<p>Those efforts led to <a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2020/43/n043p051.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the discovery a manta ray nursery</a> off the coast of southern Florida. Not only is it the first found in the area, it’s also the third nursery ever found globally, the team reported in 2020 in <em>Endangered Species Research</em>. But its located in a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-baby-florida-historic-nursery-endangered">heavily populated coastal area, where recreational fishing is popular</a> — and a threat to rays (<em>SN: 8/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>Pate has seen several mantas with missing fin tips from entangled fishing lines, as well as “mantas that look like Christmas trees” with wings covered in jigs and lures. A survey of nearly 200 recreational anglers in Palm Beach County, Fla., found that that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.3508" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just two out of three could identify a manta ray</a>, and even fewer knew how to prevent accidentally hooking one, Pate and colleagues reported in the June 2021 <em>Aquatic Conservation</em>.</p>



<p>However, 98 percent of surveyed anglers supported protecting the rays. The Florida Manta Project has since launched an outreach campaign that aims to build awareness of best practices, such as keeping an eye on the water while fishing and reeling in fishing lines until mantas have safely passed by.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, what appears to be a manta might be one of its relatives. In 2018, a diver sent Pate a photo of a manta that turned out to be a sicklefin devil ray (<em>M. tarapacana</em>) — the first confirmed sighting of this species in the western Atlantic Ocean. Sicklefin devils are similar in size and shape to mantas, but they tend to be a golden-brown instead of black.</p>





<p>The photo had Pate wondering how many past manta sightings had in fact been devil rays. An analysis of aerial surveys and fisheries observation data collected from 1996 to 2022 turned up 361 sicklefin devils in the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.</p>



<p>Because devil rays have been so understudied, “there are still huge knowledge gaps in their biology, ecology and life history,” says ecologist Joshua Stewart of Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. That makes it challenging to create management strategies that might help conserve the species. Research like Pate’s is essential for supporting “science-based conservation,” he says. It helps uncover “the movements and habitat use of these species in regions where they may be exposed to human impacts.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Pate hopes that her team’s continued efforts will help protect majestic mantas and their cousins, she says, by making the rays “as iconic and recognizable as manatees and sea turtles.”</p>

<p>A chemistry researcher in India <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dDhanaraj%2bGopi">has had seven of his papers retracted</a> after the publisher concluded that some images in the papers showed “<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ra/d3ra90024j">unexpected similarities</a>” or had been <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ra/d3ra90029k">duplicated</a>.</p>



<p>The retraction notices, issued in late March by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in the U.K., all state that:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The authors informed the Editor that the characterization of the original samples was outsourced, and they do not have the original raw data for the published results.</p>



<p>Given the significance of the concerns about the validity of the data, and the lack of raw data, the findings presented in this paper are not reliable.</p>

<p>The corresponding author, Dhanaraj Gopi of Periyar University in Tamil Nadu, had <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Dhanaraj+Gopi">several papers flagged</a> on PubPeer starting in 2019, including some that have not been retracted.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127013"></span>



<p>On a PubPeer thread about image problems in a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.6b01795">2016 paper</a> in <em>ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces</em>, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/07/meet-elisabeth-bik-who-finds-problematic-images-in-scientific-papers-for-free/">scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F23AEA94EBAB630FE2203AA33C3B5C#7">noted</a> that one figure “strongly resembles an apple crumble pie with a cloned crust.”</p>



<p>Gopi <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F23AEA94EBAB630FE2203AA33C3B5C#3">replied</a>, admitting that there had been “inadvertent misrepresentation of images in our paper due to errors in the assembly of figure panels, which were reshuffled during revision or resubmission.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Since We have no expertise in biology, We got in touch with [the] biological institution. So, we are strongly apologizing for this unintentional error. Mostly, these type[s] of errors happen due to the outsourcing [of] images. In this regard, we assure you that this mistake will not happen anymore. Also, we are in the process of correcting this in the journal. And we hope that this error does not change the interpretation of the results or the conclusions of the work in this journal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(A <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.9b20300">subsequent correction</a> issued for the paper said the authors reperformed the experiments to rectify the problem.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F23AEA94EBAB630FE2203AA33C3B5C#11">expressed puzzlement</a> at Gopi’s comments:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Does this mean that certain figures in this paper were created by outsourcing experiments? And that the authors do not have any expertise [in] what these experiments are showing?</p>



<p>Could the authors please clarify which of the figures in this paper were outsourced and to which institute or company?</p>



<p>Could the authors also please clarify which part of their paper they do not have expertise in, and which parts of the paper they feel they are not responsible for?</p>



<p>These duplications within figures are really, really hard to explain by simple mistakes, so any clarification on what actually happened here would be welcome.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We reached out to Gopi, but have not heard back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six of the retracted papers were published in <em>RSC Advances</em>. The remaining was published in <em>Journal of Materials Chemistry B</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An RSC spokesperson told <em>Retraction Watch</em>:&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on May 1, 2023.</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash;The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is pleased to announce an agreement with the University of Padua to facilitate unlimited publishing across all 12 PLOS titles with no fees for researchers. This agreement encompasses PLOS&rsquo; three innovative publishing models, ensuring researchers from the University of Padua to benefit from frictionless, fee-free publishing with PLOS. This agreement represents another in the Europe, following agreements in Germany, Sweden, Ireland and the UK <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">(Jisc).</a></p>



<p>&ldquo;We are excited to expand our footprint in Italy with these new publishing models, which enable more researchers to participate in advancing Open Science,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;The University of Padua shares our commitment to make scholarly publishing and research open and equitable for the benefit of all.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;In recent years, our university has implemented various policies aimed at making scientific research open and accessible. In accordance with an historical tradition of cultural openness and freedom, represented by our motto: <em>&lsquo;Universa Universis Patavina Libertas&rsquo;</em>, shared by scientists like Galileo Galilei, the University of Padua has identified one of its main strategic objectives as the support of open science and open access. The agreement with PLOS fits into that same viewpoint and we are very pleased to be the first University in Italy to sign it,&rdquo; said prof. Monica Salvadori, Vice Rector of Historical and Cultural Heritage and President of the Open Science Commission, University of Padua. &ldquo;We are sure that our researchers will now have more opportunities to lead scientific advancements in a more open and reliable way.&rdquo;</p>



<p>All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond the article processing charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flat Fees </a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a><a href="#_ftn3"><u>[3]</u></a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I was thrilled to have&nbsp;collaborated on&nbsp;the very first agreement in&nbsp;Italy&nbsp;between the&nbsp;University of Padua&nbsp;and PLOS. This agreement allows&nbsp;the University of Padua&nbsp;to publish in all of PLOS&rsquo; journals&nbsp;till the end of the year,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Barbara Valcelli, Accucoms Regional Sales Manager, Italy. &ldquo;I was happy to have facilitated conversations between PLOS and&nbsp;University of Padua&nbsp;to reach this important agreement which will play a key role&nbsp;in&nbsp;making scientific research&nbsp;at the University of Padua&nbsp;open and accessible.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The University of Padua joins a growing list of institutions including the Big Ten Academic Alliance, the University of California system, CRL and NERL, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester), the Sachsen and TIB consortia&rsquo;s in Germany, &nbsp;and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a> have decided to support their researchers through publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> recently honored PLOS as the 2021 co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>

<p>Dating back to 1222, the University of Padua is a leading University in Italy and has a long tradition and consolidated reputation for scientific excellence. As a multi-disciplinary institute of higher education, the University aims to provide its students with professional training and a solid cultural background.</p>



<p>Intertwined within the story of the University of Padua are the many illustrious figures who lived, studied and taught in this city. Such famous names included those who have changed the cultural and scientific history of humanity, from Copernicus to Vesalius, Galileo, to William Harvey, to the more modern Tullio Levi-Civita, Concetto Marchesi, Giuseppe &lsquo;Bepi&rsquo; Colombo and many others.</p>



<p>The University of Padua has been a proud pioneer of several endeavours, including the first university botanical garden (1545, a UNESCO World Heritage Site), the first permanent anatomical theatre (1594) and in 1678, Elena Lucrezia Cornaro becomes the first woman in the world to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree. <a href="https://www.unipd.it/en/university-padua">https://www.unipd.it/en/university-padua</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscientists-decoded-thoughts-brain-scans">Neuroscientists decoded people’s thoughts using brain scans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like Dumbledore’s wand, a scan can pull long strings of stories straight out of a person’s brain — but only if that person cooperates.<br><br>This “mind-reading” feat, described May 1 in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, has a long way to go before it can be used outside of sophisticated laboratories. But the result could ultimately lead to seamless devices that help people who can’t talk or otherwise communicate easily. The research also raises privacy concerns about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics">unwelcome neural eavesdropping</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/21</em>).</p>



<p>“I thought it was fascinating,” says Gopala Anumanchipalli, a neural engineer at the University of California, Berkeley who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s like, ‘Wow, now we are here already,’” he says. “I was delighted to see this.”</p>





<p>As opposed to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-reads-peoples-thoughts">implanted devices</a> that have shown recent promise, the new system requires no surgery (<em>SN: 11/15/22</em>). And unlike other external approaches, it produces continuous streams of words instead of having a more constrained vocabulary.</p>



<p>For the new study, three people lay inside a bulky MRI machine for at least 16 hours each. They listened to stories, mostly from <em>The Moth</em> podcast, while functional MRI scans detected changes in blood flow in the brain. These changes are proxies for brain activity, albeit slow and imperfect measures.</p>



<p>With this neural data in hand, computational neuroscientists Alexander Huth and Jerry Tang of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues were able to match patterns of brain activity to certain words and ideas. The approach relied on a language model that was built with GPT, one of the forerunners that enabled <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chatgpt-ai-artificial-intelligence-education-cheating-accuracy">today’s AI chatbots</a> (<em>SN: 4/12/23</em>).</p>



<p>Once the researchers knew which brain activity patterns matched the words in the stories, the team could work backward, using brain patterns to predict new words and ideas. The process inched along in an iterative way. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-023-01304-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decoder ranked the likelihood of words appearing after the previous word</a>, then used the brain activity patterns to help pick a winner and ultimately land on the gist of an idea.</p>



<p>“It definitely doesn’t nail every word,” Huth says. The word-for-word error rate was actually pretty high, between 92 to 94 percent. “But that doesn’t account for how it paraphrases things,” he says. “It gets the ideas.” For instance, when a person heard, “I don’t have my driver’s license yet,” the decoder spat out, “She has not even started to learn to drive yet.”</p>

<p>Such responses made it clear that the decoders struggle with pronouns, though the researchers don’t know why. “It doesn’t know who is doing what to whom,” Huth said in an April 27 news briefing.</p>





<p>Decoders could also roughly reproduce stories from people’s brains in two different scenarios: as people silently told a rehearsed story to themselves, and as they watched silent movies. The fact that these situations could be decoded was exciting, Huth says, because “it meant that what we’re getting at with this decoder, it’s not low-level language stuff.” Instead, “we’re getting at the idea of the thing.”</p>

<p>“This study is very impressive, and it gives us a glimpse of what might be possible in the future,” says Sarah Wandelt, a computational neuroscientist at Caltech who wasn’t involved in the study.</p>



<p>Fast-moving advances in brain decoding can spur discussions of mental privacy, something the researchers addressed in the new study. “We know that this could come off as creepy,” Huth says. “It’s weird that we can put people in the scanner and read out what they’re kind of thinking.”</p>



<p>But the team found that the new method isn’t one-size-fits-all: Each decoder was quite personalized and worked only for the person whose brain data had helped built it. What’s more, a person had to voluntarily cooperate for the decoder to identify ideas. If a person wasn’t paying attention to an audio story, the decoder couldn’t pick that story up from brain signals. Participants could thwart the eavesdropping effort by simply ignoring the story and thinking about animals, doing math problems or focusing on a different story.</p>



<p>“I’m glad that these experiments are done with a view to understanding the privacy,” Anumanchipalli says. “I think we should be mindful, because after the fact, it’s hard to go back and put a pause on research.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-hair-gray-stem-cells">Mouse hair turns gray when certain stem cells get stuck</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hair might go gray when stem cells with wanderlust have their travels interrupted.</p>



<p>Stem cells involved in making the pigment that gives hair its color <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05960-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behave much differently</a> than other stem cells do, researchers report April 19 in <em>Nature</em>. Rather than staying put, these melanocyte stem cells travel up and down hair follicles all while oscillating between two different forms of maturity. But it’s not the unusual behavior that leads to graying. It’s when these stem cells stop their quirky ways that hair turns white.</p>





<p>That movement is really strange behavior for stem cells, says William Lowry, a hair follicle biologist at UCLA. Stem cells usually settle into a niche, or compartment, dividing when they need to, he says. “Their progeny go off and do interesting things … whereas the stem cells typically stay put.” Lowry was not involved in the study but coauthored <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00918-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a commentary about the work</a> that also appeared April 19 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Stem cells are immature cells that make more of themselves and give rise to cells that will mature to perform specific tasks. Melanocyte stem cells can become melanocytes, the cells that make pigments which give hair and skin their color. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Qi Sun and Mayumi Ito Suzuki, stem cell biologists at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, didn’t set out to study gray hair. They wanted to know how melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle behave. The researchers had previously implicated such cells in melanoma skin cancer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand the life cycle of melanocyte stem cells, Sun watched the same patch of hair follicles on a mouse again and again over the mouse’s lifetime. She saw that melanocyte stem cells move out of a compartment at the base of the follicle and up into the follicle bulge. Then the cells turn around and head back to the base.</p>



<p>That is not the cells’ only odd behavior. The stem cells mature, or differentiate, into an intermediate form that ultimately gives rise to melanocytes, the cells that make the pigment melanin, which colors hair. For other stem cells, once they start maturing there is no going back. But melanocyte stem cells can toggle between the less-mature and more-mature states.</p>



<p>Being able to slide between the two states is necessary for hair to keep its color, Sun and colleagues report. The intermediate state is needed for migration to the base of the growing hair shaft, where some of the cells develop into melanocytes to color the hair. And the stem cell state regenerates a pool of stem cells that can then mature to touch up the roots.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="401" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042523_ts_hair-graying_inline.jpg" alt="A series of images of a hair follicle over time.

Unusually for stem cells, the cells moved and up and down the growing follicle, the team discovered.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124022">Q. Sun <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature</em> 2023</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The stem cells must move because proteins that help control cell maturity and proliferation are found in different compartments of the hair follicle. A protein called WNT made by cells in the compartment at the base of the follicle causes  stem cells to mature into melanocytes, the researchers found. But too much WNT activity prevented the stem cells from sliding back into their regenerative state.</p>



<p>As mice aged, or if the researchers plucked hairs to make them grow faster, more and more worn-out melanocyte stem cells got stuck in the hair follicle bulge. There they couldn’t mature into the intermediate stage to travel back to the base compartment where they could have formed melanocytes. That led to depletion of the color-producing cells, causing the hair to turn gray.</p>





<p>The graying could be reversed though. Getting the cells moving and starting the maturation cycle again gave hair back its color, the team found. Previous research has shown that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-stress-turns-hair-gray-triggers-body-fight-flight-response">periods of stress</a> deplete melanocytes and temporarily <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stressed-out-dna-turns-mousy-brown-hair-gray">cause hair to gray</a> (<em>SN: 1/23/20; SN: 6/11/09</em>).</p>



<p>In principle, this sort of behavior from melanocyte stem cells may cause humans’ hair to turn gray too, says Rui Yi, a stem cell biologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who was not involved in the research. Until researchers can observe human hair follicles over time, he says, it’s not possible to say for sure.</p>

As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/23/nature-paper-on-cancer-retracted-after-years-of-scrutiny/">previously reported by Retraction Watch</a>, <em>Nature</em> in 2020 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2112-4">pulled</a> a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04695">2006 paper</a> on which she was first author because of “image anomalies” and the absence of original data. Two other papers co-authored by Erler <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/79/19/5123/638733/Correction-LOXL2-Mediated-Matrix-Remodeling-in">have been</a> <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/17/10/2141/89875/Correction-Tumor-Secreted-LOXL2-Activates">corrected</a> and one additional paper has an <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/73/6/1721/587582/LOX-Mediated-Collagen-Crosslinking-Is-Responsible">expression of concern</a>.</p>

<p>The now-retracted 2015 paper claimed to have found evidence that the enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX) can be a driver of metastasis to the bone of some breast cancers. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.2990">2016 report</a> published in the J<em>ournal of Bone and Mineral Research</em> disputed some of the claims made in the paper, and in March 2018, an <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A52D8B1530C5E6AF39C6CF9C56C8B0">anonymous commenter on PubPeer</a> pointed out issues with the paper’s western blots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the April 2023 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06048-x">retraction notice</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Editors have retracted this paper because, in their view, data in Extended Data Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 4a are unreliable. Issues with the original antibody used in Extended Data Fig. 1d and 4a have been identified. The western blots showing an increase in secreted LOX in bone-trophic and hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells, and shRNA knockdown of LOX in 4T1 cells, present unreliable bands. R.L. agrees with the retraction. All other authors disagree with the retraction and believe the findings are still valid.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked to comment on the retraction, Erler forwarded a press release that she said represents the views of the 14 authors who do not agree with the decision to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the statement:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The University of Sheffield, Institute of Cancer Research, University of Copenhagen, and&nbsp; Technical University of Denmark, have independently evaluated the evidence regarding the “issue” originally raised on PubPeer around two extended figure Western blots where the legends did not clearly state that the beta-actin blots were sample processing controls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our collective assessment is that there is insufficient scientific justification for a retraction. Rather, a simple text correction, as originally proposed and agreed with Nature, should have been allowed to update the original figure legends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe a major conflict of interest has significantly influenced this case. All but one of the authors agreed to this previously approved correction and, similarly, all the authors, with the exception of the dissenting author, opposed to the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We stand by the validity of the findings and support the 14 authors opposed to the retraction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://research.ku.dk/search/result/?pure=en%2Fpersons%2Fanders-h-lund(197f8063-ab66-4565-a8bc-808c4e5380f2)%2Fpublications.html">Anders Lund</a>, director of the University of Copenhagen’s Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC) where Erler is a group leader, said the <a href="https://ufm.dk/en/research-and-innovation/councils-and-commissions/The-Danish-Board-on-Research-Misconduct">Danish Board on Research Misconduct</a>, a government agency, concluded there was no research misconduct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Prof. Erler was criticized for having mislabeled the supplementary figures,” he said of the board’s finding. “But there was no evidence of fraud in this conduct.”</p>



<p>In a call with Retraction Watch, Lund said the “major conflict of interest” cited in the statement refers to Erler’s ex-husband, <a href="https://www.lindinglab.org/">Rune Linding</a>, now a researcher at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Linding is the only author who agreed with the editor’s decision to retract the paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There were attempts earlier to settle this in a different way from retraction, corrections and so on,” said Lund, who is not one of the paper’s authors. “As far as I understand, Linding did not accept those suggestions.”</p>



<p>Linding told us:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>That is a false claim. The data issues were investigated by an international review panel and antibody experts who advised the Nature editors in their decision. The editors made their decision independently of course and I have seen no data or evidence suggesting that it is not the right decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Linding deferred to <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/james-longden-8b256b1a5">James Longden</a>, a drug discovery biologist at e-therapeutics PLC, for further comment. Longden was a biologist at Linding’s lab at the time the research was being conducted, although he is not an author of the retracted paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About a year ago, Erler failed to replicate the western blots after being asked to do so by <em>Nature </em>editors, according to Longden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the data could have been replicated, the paper would not be retracted,” Longden said in a call with Retraction Watch. “But there is data in that paper that cannot be repeated, and so therefore, the editors think it should be retracted and I agree with them.”</p>



<p>Co-corresponding author <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/medicine/people/oncology-metabolism/alison-gartland">Alison Gartland</a>, a professor of biology at the University of Sheffield, declined to comment on the record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for <em>Nature </em>told Retraction Watch:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-data-unknown-oceans-sea-mountains">Satellite data reveal nearly 20,000 previously unknown deep-sea mountains</a></h4>

              
                <p>The number of known mountains in Earth’s oceans has roughly doubled. Global satellite observations have revealed <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022EA002331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 20,000 previously unknown seamounts</a>, researchers report in the April <em>Earth and Space Science</em>.</p>



<p>Just as mountains tower over Earth’s surface, seamounts also rise above the ocean floor. The tallest mountain on Earth, as measured from base to peak, is Mauna Kea, which is part of the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Chain.</p>



<p>These underwater edifices are often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atlantic-monument-home-unique-and-varied-creatures">hot spots of marine biodiversity</a> <em>(SN: 10/7/16</em>)<em>.</em> That’s in part because their craggy walls — formed from volcanic activity — provide a plethora of habitats. Seamounts also promote upwelling of nutrient-rich water, which distributes beneficial compounds like nitrates and phosphates throughout the water column. They’re like “stirring rods in the ocean,” says David Sandwell, a geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.</p>





<p>More than 24,600 seamounts have been previously mapped. One common way of finding these hidden mountains is to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-book-how-military-funding-shaped-science-oceanography">ping the seafloor with sonar</a> (<em>SN: 4/16/21</em>). But that’s an expensive, time-intensive process that requires a ship. Only about 20 percent of the ocean has been mapped that way, says Scripps earth scientist Julie Gevorgian. “There are a lot of gaps.”</p>



<p>So Gevorgian, Sandwell and their colleagues turned to satellite observations, which provide global coverage of the world’s oceans, to take a census of seamounts.</p>



<p>The team pored over satellite measurements of the height of the sea surface. The researchers looked for centimeter-scale bumps caused by the gravitational influence of a seamount. Because rock is denser than water, the presence of a seamount slightly changes the Earth’s gravitational field at that spot. “There’s an extra gravitational attraction,” Sandwell says, that causes water to pile up above the seamount.</p>



<p>Using that technique, the team spotted 19,325 previously unknown seamounts. The researchers compared some of their observations with sonar maps of the seafloor to confirm that the newly discovered seamounts were likely real. Most of the newly discovered underwater mountains are on the small side — between roughly 700 and 2,500 meters tall, the researchers estimate.</p>



<p>However, it’s possible that some could pose a risk to mariners. “There’s a point when they’re shallow enough that they’re within the depth range of submarines,” says David Clague, a marine geologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, Calif., who was not involved in the research. In 2021, the USS Connecticut, a nuclear submarine, <a href="https://news.usni.org/2021/11/01/investigation-concludes-uss-connecticut-grounded-on-uncharted-sea-mount-in-south-china-sea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran into an uncharted seamount</a> in the South China Sea. The vessel is still undergoing repairs at a shipyard in Washington state.</p>

Service workers or those working jobs that are location dependent do not have the same ability to work remotely and therefore, their ways of working may be relatively unchanged. Yet for those in office environments, trends like remote, hybrid, and gig work have left a permanent mark on the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>From a psychological vantage-point, the social distance created by these new ways of working poses challenges to the establishment of common social norms, shared identity, and clarity around performance expectations, as the cues and opportunities for social interaction are limited. Counteracting promises of increased flexibility, many workers are feeling the fatigue created by endless hours of remote meetings and the temptation for work hours to creep into personal time. In this way, behavior has not kept pace with changes in technology.</p><h2><strong>How can academic research make a practical improvement to worker well-being?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There is a wealth of psychological literature on behavior and motivation that is ready for application into the workplace. There are so many insightful experiments from social and occupational psychology specifically, on the big topics like altruism, obedience, and conflict, that have not made their way into leadership development programs or practical advice for companies. If companies were to adopt a more humanistic perspective, by digging into the human drivers that corporate policies and procedures influence, greater employee well-being is likely to result. Right now, employees are calling out for a combination of financial, social, emotional, and physical well-being, which can be better informed by looking across disciplines and considering the workplace just like any other social environment where human drivers are at play. &nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;If companies were to adopt a more humanistic perspective &#8230; greater employee well-being is likely to result.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><h2><strong>How do we develop and support the next generation of leaders in a more remote world?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Remote, hybrid, and gig work pose distinct challenges for leaders to navigate. They will likely face employees who have a transactional mindset, less developed social networks, and inconsistent understandings of work expectations. Yet, they are likely to be more open to share their personal lives and have greater opportunities to work across geographies and cultures. As such, leaders will need the time and capability to set and communicate clear vision and goals, help employees navigate the organization, and capitalize fully on opportunities for social interaction. At the same time, these leaders might require coaching for themselves on how to attend to their own needs, even as they help others.</p><h2><strong>How does increased flexibility impact employees and organizations?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Much of the attention on the topic of flexibility has focused on physical location (i.e. working from home instead of the office), however this is just one type of flexibility.&nbsp;Employees are also calling out for a say on when they work, with control over start and end times or the ability to work a 4-day week,&nbsp;prioritizing this type of flexibility over physical location.&nbsp;When flexibility is not provided, research by EY (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ey.com/en_gl/workforce/work-reimagined-survey">Work Reimagined Employee Survey, 2021</a>) discovered that 54% of employees were willing to quit their jobs. Employers have responded by providing leniency on working hours, offering unlimited paid time off, and providing home office equipment, yet at the expense of empty and eerily quiet offices.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;When flexibility is not provided, research by EY discovered that 54% of employees were willing to quit their jobs.”</p></blockquote></div><h2><strong>What do you think the world of work will look like in 10 years?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I think in time, we will see the pandemic as just one step along a journey away from the traditional office. Twenty years ago, offices were built on a need for record keeping. Pushes towards a paperless office made file drawers disappear and bookshelves go empty, yet the office hung on due to needs for employees to access computers and other technology. Laptops and cell phones took that need away, leaving personal interaction and collaboration as the core purpose. The pandemic taught us that even that was not sacred and video conferences were an effective mechanism to get work done.&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen so much change in such a short time that it is difficult to predict what the future will hold. It is only in hindsight that we can see the progression of technology and how it can fundamentally change behavior and needs.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image: Canva</sub></em></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog - Academic insights for the thinking world.</a></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/737933759/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/737933759/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/737933759/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/737933759/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/737933759/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2023%2f04%2fWFH-Stock-Image-2-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/737933759/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/737933759/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/737933759/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/737933759/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/04/studying-ancient-tsunamis-is-all-about-glasses/">Studying ancient tsunamis is all about glasses</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/04/digital-dilemmas-feminism-ethics-and-the-cultural-implications-of-ai-podcast/">Digital dilemmas: feminism, ethics, and the cultural implications of AI [podcast]</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2023/04/eight-fun-facts-about-bibles-at-oup/">Eight fun facts about Bibles at OUP</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p>The mechanisms of limb regeneration in amphibians are fascinating and can help devise a plethora of methods in regenerative medicine and engineering. <i>Xenopus</i> and axolotl are the key models for studying limb regeneration, but other amphibians display different mechanisms and little is known on those. In this study, researchers chose to understand how it works in <em>Polypedates maculatus</em>, a species of tree frog commonly found in India, and used transcriptomics to analyze the gene expression of intact limbs and amputated limb blastemas in tadpoles and froglets.</p>
<p>They found that, when the tissue is wounded, the choice between healing and regeneration depends from a balance of several factors. In general, genes associated with inflammation led to a healing environment and do not support regeneration; on the contrary, a reduced inflammation promotes regeneration. Factors such as glycosaminoglycans, metalloproteinases, and methyl transferases, were found to be upregulated or downregulated to modulate this sort of switch mechanism and to stimulate and guide the migration of myeloid cells, which are required for regeneration, exploiting signalling pathways in ways that had not been reported in model amphibians.</p>
<p>The study confirms several conserved strategies of regeneration, but also finds differences in terms of factors and components involved in the process of limb regeneration, giving useful insights into the variety of molecules that can be involved in creating a regeneration-permissive environment potentially paving the way for new approaches for regenerative medicine.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-13206" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection.png" alt="" width="258" height="171" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection.png 797w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection-300x199.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection-768x511.png 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/institutional-objection-640x426.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" />Institutional objection to assisted dying is a debated subject, yet it is empirically understudied. It is important to understand institutional objection because it affects the experiences of patients seeking assisted dying and the impact of the particular regulatory context governing objections by institutions. This study was conducted in Victoria, that in 2019 was the first Australian state to permit voluntary assisted dying, and it investigates the impact of policy regarding institutional objection by focusing on the perspectives of family caregivers through semi-structured interviews.</p>
<p>The study involved 32 family caregivers and one patient who sought assisted dying. Participants reported institutional objection affecting eligibility assessments, medication access, and taking the medication or having it administered. Institutional objection occurred across health settings and was sometimes only inferred through context and interactions, rather than being explicitly stated. In terms of practical consequences, these objections resulted in delays, transfers, and attempts of dissuasion through pressure for palliative or other care. From a psychological point of view, participants also reported adverse emotional experiences and distrust of objecting institutions.</p>
<p>In an already procedurally challenging context, with a limited window in which patients have to apply, all the above points create a barrier in the assisted dying system. The authors argues that better regulation may be needed as Victoria’s existing policy approach appears to preference institutional positions over patient’s choice reinforcing existing power dynamics.</p>

<p>Biomedical image data often have complex patterns that are difficult for human experts to comprehend, making it challenging to develop reliable unambiguous diagnoses using these data. However, machine learning methods can help overcoming the issue.</p>
<p>In this article, the authors explore the potential of using a feature learning algorithm called Invariant Scattering Convolution Network or Wavelet scattering Network to extract features from retinal fundus images for glaucoma diagnosis. By applying a wavelet scattering network to the RIM-ONE DL image dataset, they were able to achieve a stage-wise decomposition process, simplifying and improving the interpretation of images, and extract features for glaucoma detection. The authors also examined the influence of wavelet scattering network parameter settings and 2-D channel image type on the detection correctness. They found that highly optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures achieved detection correctness up to 98%.</p>
<p>This work represents a departure from traditional methods of applying wavelet transform to pre-processed retinal fundus images and extracting handcrafted features from the decomposition results. Instead, their approach applied a wavelet scattering network directly to the images to extract features for glaucoma detection. This method may be a useful tool for developing cheap, simple, fast, and accurate healthcare solutions and further research will help to determine the versatility and reliability of this approach.</p>

To investigate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions for perinatal depression, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted.</p>
<p>A total of 31 studies with 5291 participants were included in the systematic review, and 26 studies with 4658 participants in the meta-analysis, with the majority of the studies conducted in high-income countries. The authors found that CBT-based interventions are effective, but also note that some studies were of low quality and had high levels of heterogeneity. The review identified the need for further investigation into the effectiveness of the interventions on secondary outcomes and highlighted the importance of establishing a minimum core data set to improve consistency of secondary outcome collection across trials. The study also highlighted the need to conduct trials with longer-term follow-up periods and to investigate important clinical moderators of effectiveness, such as the type of health professional delivering interventions.</p>
<p>The authors highlight the need for consistency in data collection and longer-term follow-up periods to improve the quality of the evidence base. Additionally, efforts should be made to investigate the effectiveness of interventions in low- and middle-income countries to ensure that effective treatments are accessible to all women experiencing perinatal depression.</p>

However, little is known about their use and perception. This study focuses on this aspects among young people in Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>The authors collected quantitative and open-text qualitative data through an annual cross-sectional survey of 596 young people aged 15-29 in Victoria, Australia, who reported menstruating in the past 6 months, and asked questions about their menstrual product use, use of reusable materials, product priorities, and preferences. The study found that among the participants, 37% had used a reusable product during their last menstrual period and further 11% had used one in the past. The most commonly used product was period underwear, followed by menstrual cups and reusable pads. However, 37% of participants reported not having enough information about reusable products, and this was particularly common among younger participants</p>
<p>In Victoria, the majority of people still use disposable products and there is a lack of information on menstrual products that fit specific needs. Therefore, the authors conclude that there is a need for greater education and access to reusable period products.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-paradoxes-quantum-states">Black holes resolve paradoxes by destroying quantum states</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS — </strong>Don’t try to do a quantum experiment near a black hole — its mere presence ruins all quantum states in its vicinity, researchers say.</p>



<p>The finding comes from a thought experiment that <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/M08.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pits the rules of quantum mechanics and black holes against each other</a>, physicists reported April 17 at a meeting of the American Physical Society. Any quantum experiment done near a black hole could set up a paradox, the researchers find, in which the black hole reveals information about its interior — something physics says is forbidden. The way around the paradox, the team reports, is if the black hole simply destroys any quantum states that come close.</p>





<p>That destruction could have implications for future theories of quantum gravity. These sought-after theories aim to unite quantum mechanics, the set of rules governing subatomic particles, and general relativity, which describes how mass moves on cosmic scales.</p>



<p>“The idea is to use properties of the [theories] that you understand, which [are] quantum mechanics and gravity, to probe aspects of the fundamental theory,” which is quantum gravity, says theoretical physicist Gautam Satishchandran of Princeton University.</p>



<p>Here’s how Satishchandran, along with theoretical physicists Daine Danielson and Robert Wald, both of the University of Chicago, did just that.</p>



<h4>A quantum experiment near a black hole creates a paradox</h4>



<p>First the team imagined a person, call her Alice, performing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-weirdness">famous double-slit experiment</a> in a lab orbiting a black hole (<em>SN: 11/5/10</em>). In this classic example of quantum physics, a scientist sends a particle, like an electron or a photon, toward a pair of slits in a solid barrier. If no one observes the particle’s progress, an interference pattern typical of waves appears on a screen on the other side of the barrier, as if the particle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-quantum-theory-particle-wave-double-slit-experiment">went through both slits at once</a> (<em>SN: 5/3/19</em>). But if someone, or some device, measures the particle’s path, it will register as having gone through one slit or the other. The particle’s quantum state of apparently being in two places at once collapses.</p>



<p>Then the team imagined another person, Bob, sitting just inside a black hole’s event horizon — the boundary beyond which not even light can escape the black hole’s gravity. Even though Bob <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-boundary">is doomed</a>, he can still make measurements (<em>SN: 5/16/14</em>). The laws of physics behave the same just inside the horizon as outside. “At the horizon, you wouldn’t even know you fell in,” Satishchandran says.</p>



<p>When Bob observes which slit Alice’s particle went through, the particle’s quantum state will collapse. That would also let Alice know Bob is there, messing up her experiment. But that’s a paradox — nothing done inside a black hole should affect the outside. By the laws of physics, Bob should not be able to communicate with Alice at all.</p>





<p>“The paradox is that black holes are a one-way street,” Satishchandran says. “Nothing done in the interior of a black hole can affect my experiment that I do in the exterior. But we just made up a scenario in which, definitely, the experiment will be affected.”</p>



<h4>The paradox is solved if the black hole acts like an ‘observer’</h4>



<p>The team then guessed at a possible solution to that paradox: The black hole itself forces the quantum state of Alice’s particle to collapse, whether Bob is there or not. “It must be that there’s an effect that no one has calculated in these theories that comes to the rescue,” Danielson says.</p>



<p>The rescue came from the fact that charged particles radiate, or emit light, when shaken. No matter how carefully Alice sets up her experiment, her particle will always emit a tiny amount of radiation as she moves it, the physicists showed. That radiation will have a different electromagnetic field depending on which way Alice’s particle went.</p>



<p>When the radiation crosses the black hole’s event horizon, the black hole will register that difference, effectively observing enough about the original particle to destroy its quantum state.</p>



<p>“The horizon actually ‘knows’ which way the particle went,” mathematically speaking, Satishchandran says. Alice blames the black hole for ruining her experiment, not Bob, and the paradox is resolved.</p>



<p>The team took the idea a step further. If Alice does a comparable experiment with an uncharged particle, that particle — as long as it has mass — will emit flecks of gravity called gravitons. In this case, the team found, the same thing happens as if the particle were an electron emitting packets of light.&nbsp;And if the horizon in question is not a black hole, but the cosmic horizon marking the edge of the visible universe, then Alice’s particle <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR23/Session/M08.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will still collapse</a>, the team reported at the same meeting.</p>



<h4>Quantum gravity theories need to take all this into account</h4>



<p>The ultimate goal of this thought experiment is not to create a complete theory of quantum gravity, but more to sketch an outline that a possible future theory must fit into, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“We’re not in the business of building theories of quantum gravity,” Satishchandran says. “But we would like … to provide benchmarks, which hopefully tell us something more fundamental about what such theories look like.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear how to get from here to a complete theory, agrees physicist Alex Lupsasca of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, who was not involved in the study. But the idea that black holes can act as quantum observers is interesting on its own.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a true fact that has to be part of the eventual theory of quantum gravity,” he says. “But whether it’s a crucial clue that we’re gleaning along the way to the final theory of quantum gravity, or it’s just an interesting detour on the path to uncovering that theory, is unknown.”</p>

<p>Game theory is a mathematical framework used in economics to understand how  a contestant&#8217;s strategy in a competition over resources is determined by rational decisions regarding the strategy of opponents. Over the last century since game theory was first developed in mathematical language, it has been adapted for evolutionary and animal behavior contexts, and tested across a number of animal species with different types of competitive behaviors. The consensus has historically been that weaker animals tend to lose and that the timing of their decision to give up relies on how motivated they are to attain the resources they are fighting for. This highlights how winning and losing relies on both the perceived value of the resource and the skills of the contestants.</p>
<p>However, simplifying the model to” losers quit” neglects the fact that animals may adapt their fighting behavior and strategically gain advantages against the odds. For example, some animals have more aggressive personalities, independently of their opponent, while others  may use aggression strategically and exaggerate their strength to ward off opponents that are stronger than them. In order to better understand these competitive animal behaviors, we studied male Siamese fighting fish and found that they display both of these unexpected strategic behaviors: small males more readily engage relatively bigger opponents and flair their fins to overstate their size.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is likely that the behavior of these fish relies on a combination of motivated aggression and calculated strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aggression towards bigger opponents relies on the fish’s <a href="https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12983-021-00397-x">motivation to defend its territory</a> from greater threat. Therefore, fish show less aggressive behavior when their territory is negatively affected by acoustic noise, such as that imposed on aquatic environments by light human traffic. However, male Siamese fighting fish become more aggressive once they have built bubble-nests. Males build these nests to signal their preparedness for mating and to deposit fertilized eggs into them after mating. This increases their young&#8217;s survival, is attractive to the females and therefore highly beneficial to the males. To defend territory, especially territory with bubble-nests, males use elaborate displays to ward off intruders by displaying their size and aggressiveness, including lateral displays where they present their extended fins. Interestingly, the display of fins is used to exaggerate their strength by overstating their size, but this tactic can be <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347219301332">recognized by fish</a> during a fight. As a result, contestants progressively disregard the size-information from fin displays as the fight develops. This shows that male Siamese fighting fish can adjust their assessment of their opponent’s abilities and take them into account when fighting. Therefore, it is likely that the behavior of these fish relies on a combination of motivated aggression and calculated strategy.</p>
<p>In our recent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40850-022-00156-3">study published in <em>BMC Zoology</em></a> we decided to test this hypothesis by characterizing the modulators of fighting behavior in Siamese fighting fish in detail. First, we measured each individual’s aggression level against its mirror image on two separate instances to spot any baseline personality differences. We used this information to see whether the level of aggressiveness could predict the fish’s behavior during fights against other fish. Then, we examined each animal’s behavior during fights and how they were affected by their opponent’s size and behavior when compared to their own. In order to test the fish’s motivation to fight, we interrupted the fight at 5 and again at 10 minutes into the interaction and measured how fast fish re-engaged opponents.</p>
<p>Using a composite score of consistent aggressiveness measured from the repeated mirror fights, we found that individual personalities only affected early stages of the live fights but not decisions to attack opponents or retreat. As expected, smaller animals engaged bigger opponents faster and more aggressively, but could become submissive when ongoing attacks increased the risk of injury. In addition, fish used new information from ongoing behavior as well as their energy levels to decide whether to continue fighting, and whether to escalate or retreat, respectively. Finally, the motivation to defend resources, drives behaviors meant to achieve this in the least costly manner, like signalling their size and strength or submitting to attack. On the contrary, behaviors with potentially dangerous consequences- such as engaging opponents and attacking them – depended on informed decisions like the relative size or behavior of the opponent and the territory’s value.</p>
<blockquote><p>Decisions rely on personality differences, resource value and are adjustable to changes in own and opponent fighting performance during the contest.</p></blockquote>
<p>These strategies show that male Siamese fighting fish can make calculated decisions. However, contrary to most models used in economics, where strategic decisions are considered dependent largely on fixed assessments of opponents, in Siamese fighting fish we find that decisions rely on personality differences, resource value and are adjustable to changes in own and opponent fighting performance during the contest. The evaluation of resources follows long-standing expectations by evolutionary applications of game-theory, while the composite effects of personality and the use of flexible assessments are a developing field. We hope that similar approaches can help further develop accurate models of contest theory and that their future application in other help elucidate both archetypal mechanisms and phenotypic variation across the evolutionary scale.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fentanyl-deaths-children-teens-opioid">Fentanyl deaths have spiked among U.S. children and teens</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid, is killing a growing number of children and teens in the United States. &nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 1,500 kids under the age of 20 died from fentanyl in 2021, four times as many as in 2018, says epidemiologist Julie Gaither of the Yale School of Medicine, who will present the data May 1 at the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; The fentanyl deaths account for nearly all of the opioid-related deaths in this age group in 2021.</p>





<p>Fentanyl is a lab-made opioid used for pain treatment that is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin, making it lethal at a much smaller dose. The drug is also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/synthetic-prescription-opioids-deaths">manufactured and sold illegally</a> and is increasingly found contaminating counterfeit prescription drugs, or entirely replacing the drug a buyer expects to get (<em>SN: 5/1/18</em>).</p>



<p>“That’s primarily the story of what’s happening among teenagers,” says pediatrician and addiction provider Sarah Bagley of the Boston University Chobanian &amp; Avedisian School of Medicine. They intend to purchase and use one kind of drug or substance but unknowingly ingest fentanyl. “People are not anticipating that they are going to be exposed to fentanyl, and then they are, and that results in an overdose.”</p>



<p>Some of the signs that a person is experiencing an overdose include falling asleep, losing consciousness, gurgling or choking sounds and weak or no breathing.</p>



<p>“This change in the drug supply, where you just have a much more potent opioid, is really driving it all,” says Bagley, who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Many of the fentanyl deaths among children and teens occurred at home and the vast majority were accidents, Gaither reports. “For smaller kids, kids who are mobile, they could be taking a drug that’s off the floor,” she says. There needs to be more education so that parents understand how lethal fentanyl is and that drugs “need to be kept out of proximity to a child.”</p>



<p>Gaither analyzed pediatric mortality data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1999 to 2021. The mortality rate from fentanyl soared more than 300 percent during that period, from 0.47 per 100,000 children to 1.92 per 100,000, she found. In 2021, 40 infants and 93 children 1 to 4 years of age died from fentanyl.</p>

<h3>Deadly trend</h3>



<p>Opioid deaths in the United States have been rising since the late 1990s, as the drugs were more frequently prescribed. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl has increasingly been found in the illegal drug supply in the last decade. By 2017, more children under age 20 were dying from fentanyl than from other opioids, and those deaths have since spiked, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.</p>

<p>Fentanyl deaths have also been climbing for adults. More than 70,000 deaths in the United States were due to synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, in 2021, out of over <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">106,000 drug overdose fatalities</a> reported that year.</p>



<p>Naloxone, a medication that can reverse an opioid overdose, was <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-over-counter-naloxone-nasal-spray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved for the over-the-counter use</a> in March by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is expected to be available at a variety of stores in late summer. Some communities have been holding trainings on how to administer the medication, which comes as a nasal spray, and conclude by distributing naloxone to participants.</p>



<p>Sold under the brand name Narcan, the opioid antidote “is safe for kids of all ages,” Gaither says. If parents have the medication on hand, they can “reverse the effects of the opioids almost immediately.”</p>



<p>It’s important to also raise awareness of Narcan among teenagers, Bagley says. In conversations she’s had with teens, they have a lot of questions about how to keep their friends safe, “which is really wonderful.” Discussing overdoses with teens can include talking about an individual’s risk as well as “how do you take care of the people in your life you care about so much and respond if they’re in crisis.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former director of a cancer research center faked data and presented others’ published data and text as his own in four grant applications to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and one research record, according to a U.S. government watchdog.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/academics/faculty/johnny-j-he/">Johnny J. He</a>, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science (RFUMS) in Chicago, Ill., “engaged in research misconduct by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly falsifying, fabricating, and plagiarizing experimental data and text” published by other scientists, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) <a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-he-johnny-j">said today</a>.</p>



<p>He did not immediately respond to an email or phone call seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-127006"></span>



<p>He <a href="https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/news/call-him-johnny-meet-the-new-director-of-the-center-for-cancer-cell-biology-immunology-and-infection/">started at RFUMS in 2020</a> as the director of the Center for Cancer Cell Biology, Immunology and Infection and the chair of the Discipline of Microbiology and Immunology. The <a href="https://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/research/centers/centers-institutes-and-consortia/cancer-cell-biology-immunology-and-infection/">cancer research center</a> now lists another scientist as its director, but He remains among its members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He received nearly $15 million in NIH funding from 2000 to 2021, about $1.5 million of that total while at RFUMS. Before his current post, he was a professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORI found that He took figures from published papers by other researchers and used them to represent his own data in NIH grant applications, sometimes cropping and splicing the images. He also plagiarized text from published articles, ORI said. None of the grant applications with plagiarized and faked data were funded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the agency and agreed to a three-year period of supervision for his research. During that time, He may not serve on any advisory committee, board, or peer review committee for the U.S. Public Health Service, which includes the NIH.</p>



<p>We reached out to RFUMS for comment and received a <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rosalind-Franklin-University-statement.pdf">statement</a> from Ronald S. Kaplan, the university’s executive vice president for research, which read in part: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The RFU Office of Research Integrity was alerted to allegations of research misconduct and conducted a thorough investigation, in strict accordance with university policies. The RFU investigation determined that research misconduct had taken place and promptly imposed appropriate sanctions and initiated the appropriate steps for remediation. RFU forwarded the investigation report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Research Integrity as required by university policies and federal regulations. HHS ORI made findings of research misconduct that have been recently published and are nearly identical to our findings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/findings-zoonomia-project-mammal-genomes">Here are 5 cool findings from a massive project on 240 mammal genomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have taken a deep dive into the wild world of mammalian evolution.</p>



<p>An international team of more than 100 researchers has <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn3943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyzed genetic information from 240 mammalian species</a>. Using the data, scientists can begin to answer questions about human disease, the brain, the arc of mammalian life on Earth and more.</p>



<p>Called the <a href="https://zoonomiaproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoonomia Project</a>, the research involved collecting DNA from species across mammals’ family tree, including an aardvark, human, fat-tailed dwarf lemur and a tapir, the team reports in 11 studies in the April 28 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“It’s a really nice survey of the mammals that are out there,” says Irene Gallego Romero, a human evolutionary geneticist at the University of Melbourne in Australia who was not a part of the work.</p>



<p>For every one of those mammals, scientists read out the slew of DNA “letters” that make up an animal’s genetic instruction book, or its genome, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2876-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work first described in 2020</a>. Then, the team lined up the text of each mammal’s book and looked for differences. Some text stayed nearly identical across all species examined, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Those spots, which have remained mostly unchanged across some 100 million years of evolution, may be parts of the genomes that are “doing something important,” geneticist Elinor Karlsson of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester said in an April 25 news briefing. Sections with lots of changes are interesting too, she says, and can offer clues about how a particular species may be adapting to its environment.</p>



<p>Karlsson recognizes that the 240 studied species, all placental mammals, represent just a tiny slice of living mammals — roughly 4 percent. And one animal not included “will annoy me to no end,” she said with a laugh. “For some reason, we couldn’t get a raccoon.”</p>



<p>But the team now has enough species to zero in on potentially essential bits of the mammalian genome, and to start to piece together new stories about mammals&#8217; evolution, including our own. Here are five findings that we thought were especially cool.</p>



<h4>1. A legendary sled dog’s genetic changes may have helped it survive in an extreme environment<strong>.</strong></h4>


<div class="wp-block-image  has-alignleft">
<figure class="alignleft size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="364" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-364x450.jpg" alt="A black and white photo of Balto the sled dog with a man in a fur jacket." class="wp-image-3124054" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-364x450.jpg 364w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-310x383.jpg 310w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-151x186.jpg 151w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-470x580.jpg 470w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline-628x776.jpg 628w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/042723_mr_zoonomia_inline.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3124054">Balto the famous sled dog had genetic variants that may have helped him survive in 1920s Alaska.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3124054">Brown Brothers/Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In 1925, a sled dog named Balto helped deliver diphtheria medicine to children in Nome, Alaska, a feat that made him famous. He was part of a dog population that had adapted to the region’s harsh conditions, scientists now propose. <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn5887" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An analysis of Balto’s DNA</a>, extracted from his remains, hints at what made these sled dogs so tough.</p>



<p>Balto most likely had an enhanced ability to digest starch and carried relatively few potentially damaging mutations, the researchers report. He was also less inbred than modern dogs — a sign that his population was genetically healthy.</p>





<p>Scientists also uncovered gene variants linked to bone and skin development. They can’t say for sure what advantages those variants offered, but it’s possible they gave Balto tough foot pads that helped him endure the cold and ice, says study coauthor Heather Jay Huson, an animal geneticist at Cornell University. “He was likely a very hardy dog.”</p>



<h4>2. Mammalian evolution ramped up well before the dinosaurs died out.</h4>



<p>The <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl8189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">origin of placental mammals may trace back to 102 million years ago</a>, one Zoonomia analysis suggests.</p>



<p>Scientists have long debated the timing of when mammalian evolution got underway. One traditional view is that the number of new mammalian species began to grow after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-asteroids-dinosaurs-impact-crater-nadir">an asteroid (or two</a>) hit Earth some 66 million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs (<em>SN: 8/22/22</em>).</p>



<p>But the new study supports a much longer timeline for different groups of mammals to arise. Instead, mammalian evolution may have kicked off around the time that the continents were breaking apart, and then continued over time, while <em>Spinosaurus</em> and <em>Oviraptor</em> still roamed Earth. Later, after the mass extinction event that marked the Cretaceous Period’s end, even more new mammalian species evolved.</p>



<p>While people may think mammals didn’t branch out until after the dinosaurs went extinct, “the data really suggest that they started to diverge earlier on,” Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at the Broad Institute and Uppsala University in Sweden, said in the news conference.</p>



<h4>3. Mammalian genomes could help identify genes that drive human cancer.</h4>



<p>In people with cancer, scientists can find mutations speckled through the genome. As cancers grow, these genetic changes tend to pile up. But it can be hard to know which mutations matter — which ones trigger or nudge along the disease. Data from the Zoonomia Project could help pinpoint which ones are important.</p>



<p>One of the new studies examined <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn2937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutations that occur in medulloblastoma</a>, a malignant brain tumor that mainly affects kids. The researchers looked for mutations in spots in the mammalian genome that don’t typically change. Because that DNA is shared across hundreds of mammal species, it’s likely essential for health, Gallego Romero says. Any disruptions could have big consequences — like cancer.</p>



<p>So a cancer mutation in these areas “is probably one of the ones to focus on,” says Gallego Romero, who wrote <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh0745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a commentary on the studies</a> in the same issue of <em>Science</em>. It could be one of the key genetic changes responsible for setting off the disease, she says. Homing in on these potentially problematic mutations could help scientists identify suspicious genes and figure out treatments.</p>



<h4>4. Some “jumping genes” may be more likely in meat eaters.</h4>



<p>Scientists have known for decades that some stretches of organisms’ genomes can hop from one location to another. Now, one Zoonomia study estimates just <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn1430" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how much of the genome is mobile among mammals</a>, and how an animal’s diet may come into play.</p>



<p>Among the hundreds of mammals analyzed, aardvark genomes were the most stuffed with “jumping genes,” researchers found. These mobile elements make up nearly 75 percent of the animal’s genome.</p>



<p>Meat-eating mammals also stood out. Compared with their noncarnivorous counterparts, meat eaters tended to accumulate more of one jumping gene type. “That was a little bit shocking to me,” says Nathan Upham, an evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved with the work, but also cowrote <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2209" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an accompanying commentary</a>.</p>



<p>It’s possible that predators somehow receive DNA from the prey they’re eating. That suggests that an animal’s ecology — in particular, what it eats — shapes the evolution of its genome, Upham says.</p>



<h4>5. Comparing the genomes of humans and other mammals might reveal secrets about the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Researchers have long sought what in our DNA sets us apart from other animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lining up mammals’ genomes and looking for regions in human DNA that have undergone lots of changes unearthed some clues. Those regions represent <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm1696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">areas that are evolving faster in humans than in other mammals&nbsp;</a>—&nbsp;and could hint at what makes us unique, researchers report in one Zoonomia study.</p>



<p>The scientists suggest that the human genome folds up in such a way that brings fast-changing regions physically close to genes involved in brain development, like two shoelace ends brought closer together when tying a knot. That proximity may ultimately dial up gene activity&nbsp;— perhaps changing how the human brain works.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, scientists don’t know exactly what such genomic alterations might do. But, Lindblad-Toh says, “it’s important to remember that what makes us human is not one change, but many, many changes.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worms-escape-tangle-knot-speed">These worms can escape tangled blobs in an instant. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like tiny, wriggling Houdinis, California blackworms are master escape artists. Groups of the worms work themselves into gnarly tangles but they can undo the knots in just tens of milliseconds. Now scientists have teased out how they do it.</p>



<p>Found in ponds and other standing water, California blackworms (<em>Lumbriculus variegatus</em>) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-worm-blobs-behave-liquid-and-solid">interlace themselves into clumps</a> to control their temperature or conserve moisture (<em>SN: 1/11/19</em>). The worms are typically just a few centimeters long. Their clumps, which can contain anywhere from 5 to 50,000 worms, take minutes to weave. But when spooked by a potential predator, the worms are outta there in an instant.</p>





<p>Videos and ultrasound images helped scientists unravel the worms’ behavior. The tangling and loosening <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade7759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results from the different types of sinuous paths the worms take</a>, researchers report in the April 28 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>When the worms are in tangling mode, they do loop-de-loops in the clump, swimming in circular paths that only occasionally switch direction between clockwise and counterclockwise. To disentangle, the worms go into overdrive, frequently switching between clockwise and counterclockwise, often forming figure eights with their bodies. “It’s kind of like the worms have two gears,” — tangling or untangling — says applied mathematician Vishal Patil of Stanford University.</p>

<p>Patil and colleagues created computer simulations that re-created the worms’ elite escape skills. Simulated worms that rarely changed looping direction tangled into a blob, and those that often reversed course quickly exploded out of the knot. Those simulations helped confirm the mechanism behind the tangling and untangling.</p>



<p>Understanding how tangling and untangling works is relevant beyond worms — or this morning’s bedhead. Felt is made from tangled fibers, as are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-nest-sturdy-physics">birds’ nests</a> and a host of other materials (<em>SN: 5/12/22</em>). Studying worm snarls might help scientists design tangled materials that can be tweaked. By changing the amount of tangle between fibers, scientists could adjust properties like the stiffness of a material.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2023/04/plos-response-to-the-national-institutes-of-health-request-for-information/">PLOS response to the National Institutes of Health Request for Information</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently requested feedback on its planned implementation of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) directive</a> to make all US federally funded research immediately publicly accessible. PLOS has been a longtime champion of making scholarly publications, and their underlying data, immediately available to the public, and we welcomed the opportunity to share our feedback. Below is our response to this request.</p>



<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>



<p>As a nonprofit Open Science publisher, PLOS aims to ensure that Open Science is practicable for the entire scholarly community, and that the reward system of science appropriately acknowledges and honors Open Science practices as contributing to a common good. We wish to express our enthusiastic support for the vision articulated in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">OSTP memo of August 25 2022</a> and our appreciation of the NIH&rsquo;s thoughtful steps toward realizing that vision. We appreciate <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-091.html">the opportunity</a> to share our perspective on the NIH&rsquo;s plan to enhance access to the results of research, and improve equity in scholarly publishing for authors and readers alike.</p>



<p>The rapid dissemination and widespread availability of research and underlying data through Open Science is key to meeting major challenges&mdash;from the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic to the climate crisis&mdash;with effective, evidence-based solutions grounded in rigorous reproducible science. We see Openness as more than the ability to read research articles. Openness includes unrestricted access to the tools and information necessary to understand research results in context, to verify and reproduce results, and to reuse data and methods. True Openness also means equitable opportunities for publication and participation in the peer review process.</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>How to best ensure equity in publication opportunities for NIH-supported investigators.</strong></li></ol>



<p>We believe that equitable access to Open publishing opportunities requires a shift away from a volumetric &lsquo;pay per publication&rsquo; model reliant on Article Processing Charges (APCs). APCs have demonstrated that Open Access is viable&mdash;but they are exclusionary and they create incentives for publishers to increase volume or price. Waivers, while a useful stop-gap, are not a sustainable solution.</p>



<p>Instead, we should work together to evolve new models based on partnership, collaboration, and community. Already, publishers, including PLOS, are experimenting with new ways to finance Open Access, including <a href="https://plos.org/publish/community-action-publishing-for-authors/">Community Action Publishing,</a> Subscribe to Open programs, and more.</p>



<p>In the short term, and in parallel with developing and honing new solutions, we can implement simple changes to better meet author and stakeholder needs.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Establish funding mechanisms specifically for research dissemination. Researchers shouldn&rsquo;t have to choose between using their grant to pay a publication fee, or to conduct more experiments.</li><li>Aggregate funding for publication services fees through a university library or similar body, rather than allocating small amounts through individual research grants. Centralizing administrative functions increases efficiency, reduces the administrative burden on individual researchers and the administrative costs to publishers, and makes it possible to more fairly distribute the cost of publication, putting Open Access within reach for more of the research community.</li></ol>



<p>In the US, libraries and consortia have shown that they are open to testing new methods, and that these types of partnership can be effective both in increasing transparency, and addressing cost inflation.</p>



<ol type="1" start="2"><li><strong>Steps for improving equity in access and accessibility of publications.</strong></li></ol>



<p>PLOS supports the NIH&rsquo;s efforts to increase and accelerate access to publicly funded research. Eliminating the embargo will meaningfully benefit researchers, practitioners, and patients alike, and is reasonable and feasible for publishers as well. PLOS has always deposited research with indexing and archiving services as soon as possible following publications.</p>



<p>We also appreciate the emphasis placed on machine readability, which is essential to discoverability, reuse, and reanalysis. However, because the NIH policy provides for access alone, without the legal right to reuse that true <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Open Access licensing</a> provides, its utility is limited&mdash;especially in this era of big data and rich text data mining. Reuse and redistribution are key to maximizing the reach and impact of research.</p>



<p>Equally vital to reproducibility is ensuring access to research outputs other than articles, such as data and methods documentation, including study designs, code, and protocols. The NIH can help to drive change in this area by encouraging, reinforcing, and rewarding the sharing of a broader range of research outputs in line with best practices for reproducibility, transparency, and inclusivity, in the grant application process.</p>



<ol type="1" start="3"><li><strong>Methods for monitoring evolving costs and impacts on affected communities.</strong></li></ol>



<p>The expectation of transparency in pricing policy will encourage continued experimentation with more equitable scholarly communications business models, helping to drive positive change.</p>



<p>In the short term, we recommend that the NIH take advantage of the considerable public information on pricing already available, by aligning with established systems (like those of Coalition S). Gathering similar information independently in a new system will create additional administrative tasks and unnecessary expense.</p>



<p>In developing any new monitoring or measurement frameworks, it&rsquo;s crucial to recognize that individual article fees are not an essential part of an Open system. Future monitoring efforts must be structured in a way that allows for the evolution of business models, which is key to increasing equity in publication opportunities. In order to be successfully adopted, any new monitoring framework must also be broadly applicable beyond the NIH, or the US context alone.</p>



<ol type="1" start="4"><li><strong>Early input on considerations to increase findability and transparency of research.</strong></li></ol>



<p>The development and consistent application of shared metadata standards is key to discoverability and credibility. We encourage the NIH to invest and participate in community-based metadata initiatives in order to build systems that work for all, and to prioritize systems with the broadest potential impact, focusing on utility and reuse with the aim of increasing system-wide efficiency and accelerating scientific advancement.</p>



<p>To be effective, metadata and persistent identifiers (PIDs) must be interoperable and follow some level of standardization. Therefore the NIH should recognize the benefits of making specific recommendations in this area, to accelerate harmonization around emerging standards adopted by the scientific community. In developing guidelines for grantees and publishers, the NIH should:</p>



<ul><li>Specify clear and detailed metadata standards and provide recommendations about which PIDs to use to describe diverse research artifacts and the links between them, both in a machine-readable way at scale, and as human readers accessing individual research elements.</li><li>Set expectations for PIDs and metadata to understand the individual contributions of authors, editors, and peer reviewers, and provide a digital infrastructure to support credit for all contributions.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Although Open Access has made great strides over the past two decades, the majority of research outputs are still not accessible, either because they are behind a paywall (according to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265545">recent analysis</a> of Web of Science and Dimensions data, 53-56% of published research remains closed), or because they have not been shared at all (e.g. datasets, protocols, negative and null results).</p>



<p>In order to actively move away from paywalled research, we need to change the reward system of science, ensuring that researchers receive meaningful credit and recognition for all kinds of contributions. This includes both acknowledgement for a wider variety of research creation and assessment roles, from protocol development through peer review, and a more representative range of research outputs, including information that contextualizes research articles and enables reproducibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaccines-antibodies-rsv-virus">Here’s what we know about upcoming vaccines and antibodies against RSV</a></h4>

              
                <p>Finally, researchers may have ways to combat a deadly respiratory illness.</p>



<p>The disease is not the flu or COVID-19, but respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.</p>



<p>The virus was first identified in 1957 in Baltimore, but it has probably been around for millennia, says Jim Boonyaratanakornkit, a virologist and transplant immunologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. “It’s always been a plague for the very young and the very old,” he says.</p>



<p>In Europe, people age 60 and older may soon get some protection against the virus. An advisory committee recommended April 26 that a vaccine against RSV made by the pharmaceutical giant GSK should be approved for use. That decision will go to the European Commission for final approval.</p>





<p>No RSV vaccine has been approved in the United States. And there are no specific antiviral medications to combat RSV, and only one preventive treatment — a monoclonal antibody — is reserved for a small number of babies at high risk of severe disease. But that could soon change. Several companies now have clinical trial data suggesting that their various vaccine candidates or lab-made monoclonal antibodies can protect against RSV’s worst consequences.</p>



<p>Those treatments are geared, in part, toward the youngest children. People of all ages can contract the virus, but it tends to hit the youngest the hardest. In 2019, RSV caused an estimated 33 million infections worldwide in children ages 5 and younger. About 3.6 million children were hospitalized and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00478-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 100,000 died</a>, researchers reported last year in the <em>Lancet</em>. Their calculations revealed that RSV causes 1 in every 28 deaths of children 28-days- to 6-months-old.</p>



<p>“This is why we should care,” Penny Heaton of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a company owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson, said April 4 at the World Vaccine Congress, held in Washington D.C. Vaccines and antibodies might be able to prevent some of those deaths. “This is the amazing impact that … RSV vaccines [and] monoclonal antibodies … can have on the health of children globally.”</p>



<p>But it’s not just the 5-and-under crowd who will benefit. Their grandparents, great-grandparents and other older adults could soon get RSV shots. That could mean an easing of the burden of RSV in the two groups hit hardest by the virus.</p>



<p>Two companies — GSK, formerly GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer — are close to getting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for their RSV vaccines. Moderna isn’t far behind with an mRNA-based RSV vaccine. Meanwhile, Danish company Bavarian Nordic expects results from a clinical trial soon for its vaccine, and several other companies also have RSV vaccines in the works.</p>





<p>Other companies are developing monoclonal antibodies to give to babies and infants as preventives against RSV. Those lab-made antibodies aren’t vaccines, but a dose given before the start of RSV season may temporarily protect vulnerable babies from becoming very sick if they get infected.</p>



<p>There are so many options on the horizon that Janssen decided to bow out. “As we looked across our portfolio, and we looked across the RSV landscape,” Heaton said, “we have made the decision to discontinue our RSV program,” and to stop a late-stage clinical trial. The company also <a href="https://www.janssen.com/janssen-provides-portfolio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced the decision</a> in March, saying it wanted to focus on unmet medical needs. RSV, it seems, may soon no longer fit that bill.</p>



<p>For now, the virus is still very much a problem. Usually, RSV season starts in October and peaks in December or January — at least in the United States. It generally ends in April.</p>



<p>The virus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">almost vanished</a> in the winter of 2020–21. In that first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, RSV-positive PCR tests never rose above 3 percent — the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s threshold for an epidemic. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, RSV positivity rates peaked each season at about 13 to 16 percent. &nbsp;RSV’s disappearance was thanks mostly to precautions, including social distancing and mask-wearing, put in place against COVID-19.</p>



<p>But the virus rebounded, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7214a1.htm?s_cid=mm7214a1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appearing in the summer of 2021</a>, researchers report April 7 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. That year RSV season shifted, starting in May. It hit its zenith in July and ended in January 2022.</p>



<p>The 2022–23 RSV season shifted closer to the prepandemic pattern but was still early. The 2022 season started in June and peaked in November with a positivity rate of 19 percent. &nbsp;The season ended sometime between December and February, depending on which part of the country you live in. This latest RSV season hit kids hard, overwhelming children’s hospitals in some places.</p>



<p>No one knows when the next RSV season will begin. But some of the vaccines and treatments in development could be ready for deployment this fall, potentially reducing the number of doctor visits, hospitalizations and deaths from the infections.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of the vaccine and treatment candidates.</p>



<h4>What is in the vaccines?</h4>



<p>Three companies — Pfizer, GSK and Moderna — have based their vaccines on one of RSV&#8217;s proteins. That protein, called the F protein, sits on the virus’s outer membrane and helps it fuse to human cells. The F protein is a shapeshifter. Before fusion, it looks like a rounded knob. After fusion, it resembles a needle or pointy tower.</p>

Researchers discovered a decade ago that the F protein has a knobby shape (illustrated at left) before the virus fuses with a cell. After fusion, the protein takes on a pointier shape (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123907">Jason McLellan</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A decade ago, researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health figured out that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1243283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">locking the protein into its prefusion knob state</a> causes the immune system to react more strongly than to the virus’ shapeshifting form. All three companies use some version of the F protein locked in the prefusion state in their vaccines. Pfizer described the nitty-gritty <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ade6422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details of making this stabilized F protein</a> April 6 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Pfizer and GSK’s vaccines contain the protein itself. Moderna’s candidate, like its COVID-19 vaccine, is an mRNA vaccine that tells the body to produce the protein.</p>



<p>Bavarian Nordic is taking a different approach. The company makes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine">a vaccine that works against both smallpox and mpox</a>, formerly called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-ebola-monkeypox-mpox-polio-hepatitis-bird-flu-2022">monkeypox</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/22</em>). That vaccine is live vaccinia virus, a pox virus that has been engineered so that it can’t replicate well in the body. Many vaccines, including those against flu, measles and chicken pox are also such live attenuated, or weakened, viruses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For its RSV vaccine, Bavarian Nordic engineered the vaccinia virus to <a href="https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/what-we-do/pipeline/rsv.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make five of RSV’s proteins</a>, including the F protein. At the World Vaccine Congress, one person asked whether such a hybrid virus might give protection against RSV, mpox and smallpox. But the company has no data yet to suggest the vaccine would protect against all three, Peter Costa, Bavarian Nordic’s U.S. medical affairs regional lead, said April 5 during a session in which multiple companies presented data on RSV vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.</p>



<p>Another company, Codagenix, is working with the RSV virus itself, tinkering with its genetic instruction book to make the virus unable to cause disease. For its vaccine, the company’s researchers introduced more than 1,000 mutations in one gene to slow replication of the virus, says Jeffrey Fu, the company’s chief business officer. Those mutations change the virus’s RNA but don’t alter the amino acids in its proteins.</p>



<p>“We’re able to design viruses … that look identical or nearly identical to the real virus,” Fu told me. Because the virus replicates slowly, it doesn’t cause disease but stimulates an immune reaction. The vaccine will be given as nose drops, unlike the other vaccines, which are given as shots.</p>



<p>Codagenix plans to start testing its vaccine’s safety at a low dose in healthy 5-year-olds this spring. If safe, the company wants to gradually increase the dose as well as begin testing the vaccine candidate in younger children, working down to 6-month-olds. </p>



<p>Pfizer’s vaccine is being tested for its ability to protect newborns, babies and older adults. The rest of the companies&#8217; vaccines are for use in older adults.</p>



<h4>How well do the RSV vaccines work in newborns and babies?</h4>



<p>Only Pfizer is testing a vaccine to protect newborns. And it doesn’t give shots to babies. Instead, the company gave its vaccine candidate to more than 7,300 healthy pregnant women age 49 or younger. The idea is that the mother will produce antibodies against RSV that will transfer through the placenta to the baby. Those antibodies would give babies temporary protection against the virus in the especially vulnerable first six months of life.</p>



<p>Most children get infected with RSV by the time they are 2 years old. The disease may be just a coldlike illness for many kids, with a runny nose, decrease in appetite and a cough. But wheezing or difficulty breathing can also occur, and very young infants might pause breathing for more than 10 seconds. RSV can also lead to more severe illnesses including bronchitis and pneumonia.</p>



<p>Pfizer’s strategy to protect babies from these consequences of RSV seems to have worked. In the 90 days after birth, six infants born to moms who got the vaccine had severe RSV lung infections requiring medical attention. In the placebo group, 33 babies had severe lung infections. That’s a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2216480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine efficacy of 81.8 percent</a>, researchers report April 5 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Over time, that vaccine efficacy slipped a bit as mothers&#8217; antibodies wore out. Within six months after birth, 19 babies of mothers in the vaccine group and 62 infants of mothers in the placebo group developed severe lung infections, a vaccine efficacy of about 69 percent.</p>



<p>The vaccine didn’t meet statistical criteria for preventing less-severe lung infections, but there were about half the number of such infections in babies whose mothers got the vaccine compared with babies whose mothers got a placebo. Within 90 days after birth, 24 infants in the vaccinated-mom group and 56 in the placebo group got lung infections. That’s roughly 57 percent efficacy. That efficacy against less-severe lung infections also slipped slightly, to 51 percent, within 180 days of birth.</p>



<p>The vaccine kept babies out of the hospital too. In the first 90 days of life, the vaccine’s efficacy was almost 68 percent at preventing hospitalization, falling to about 57 percent efficacy within 180 days of birth.</p>



<p>Like the COVID vaccines and most vaccines for respiratory illnesses, the vaccine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">wasn’t great at preventing infection</a> (<em>SN: 5/29/22</em>). The vaccine’s efficacy against any RSV illness requiring medical attention was about 39 percent in the first three months of life and 38 percent in the six months after birth.</p>



<p>As for safety, there weren’t side effects beyond what researchers expected; some pain at the injection site, some muscle aches. “This was a maternal trial, so obviously moms were tired [and] had headaches. You can see that from the placebo numbers,” Barbara Pahud, the clinical lead for Pfizer’s ongoing study, said at the vaccine congress. No serious safety concerns caused by the vaccine appeared during the trial in either mothers or babies.</p>



<p>Pfizer is continuing to follow the children and will have two years’ worth of data to present ahead of an FDA meeting to discuss the vaccine’s approval in August, she said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Protecting babies</h3>



<p>Giving an RSV vaccine to pregnant women helped protect those women&#8217;s infants from severe RSV lung infections that required medical attention. Antibodies transferred from the vaccinated mothers were most effective in the first 90 days after birth. The vaccine&#8217;s efficacy was 81 percent in that period. As babies&#8217; bodies broke down the antibodies, the vaccine&#8217;s efficacy waned a bit, but was still more than 69 percent effective six months after birth.</p>

<p>Codagenix has data from lab animal studies suggesting its vaccine can trigger the production of protective antibodies. But its trial in children is just getting started, and there are no results to report yet.</p>



<h4>Do monoclonal antibodies help protect newborns and babies?</h4>



<p>Giving monoclonal antibodies to newborns and babies might help against RSV too. Like antibodies passed from mothers to babies, lab-made antibodies targeted against the virus’s F protein are showing some signs of success at protecting infants against RSV.</p>



<p>One monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, was approved by the FDA in 1998. But that antibody is used only for babies at the highest risk of severe illness from RSV. That includes babies born prematurely, those with a chronic lung condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia and infants with certain heart conditions. That’s only a fraction of the babies born in the United States each year. And palivizumab isn’t available in most of the low- and middle-income countries where the virus is the biggest problem, Codagenix’s Fu says.</p>



<p>What’s more, palivizumab doesn’t last long. Vulnerable babies need an injection every month during RSV season. And at more than $1,800 per dose, the medication is expensive.</p>



<p>Some companies have been working on more potent, longer-lasting monoclonal antibodies for use in babies and infants. Sanofi and AstraZeneca teamed up to make one called nirsevimab. That antibody was approved for use in the European Union and the United Kingdom in November. It is being considered for approval in the United States.</p>



<p>In a clinical trial, about 2,000 newborns got an injection of nirsevimab and about 1,000 babies got a placebo. Through 150 days after getting the shot, the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2214773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antibody’s efficacy against hospitalization was 76.8 percent</a>, researchers report April 5 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em></p>



<p>Merck also has a long-lasting monoclonal antibody being <a href="https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/trial/nct04938830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested in clinical trials</a>. Results from those studies aren’t yet available.</p>



<h4>Do the vaccines protect older people?</h4>



<p>Babies, toddlers and preschoolers are perhaps the population that people worry most about when it comes to RSV, but the virus hits older people hard too.</p>



<p>In the United States alone, between 60,000 and 160,000 older adults are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/high-risk/older-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospitalized with RSV each year</a>, and 6,000 to 10,000 die, the CDC estimates. <br><br>In 2019, an estimated <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irv.13031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.2 million people</a> ages 60 or older caught RSV in high-income countries, researchers reported last year in <em>Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses.</em> Of the 5.2 million cases, 470,000 people landed in the hospital, with about 33,000 of those dying, the researchers estimate. The study looked only at high-income countries, including the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan and some European countries. But if the kid data are any indication, the death rate for older folks may have been much higher had people in low- and middle-income countries been included. </p>



<p>“This is a relatively unrecognized infection in adult populations,” Edward Walsh, an infectious diseases doctor at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said April 5 at the World Vaccine Congress.</p>



<p>Walsh was one of the lead researchers testing Pfizer’s vaccine for older adults. He and colleagues conducted a large trial involving more than 34,000 people ages 60 and older in Argentina, Canada, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa and the United States. Half got Pfizer’s vaccine candidate, and half got a placebo.</p>



<p>The trial started in August 2021. Though RSV reemerged to infect a lot of children that year, it didn’t come back in prepandemic numbers in older adults, especially not in the over-60 crowd, Walsh said. “They continued to stay away from grandchildren, stay away from crowds and wear masks,” preventing transmission.</p>



<p>Walsh told me later that he and colleagues found only 16 percent of prepandemic numbers of infections in older adults in the Rochester area during the study period. With such low numbers of infections, “we were very nervous that [the trial] wasn’t going to show us anything.”</p>



<p>The Rochester area was just one of 240 sites in the study. With the information collected from each site, the researchers had enough data to calculate the vaccine’s efficacy. The researchers considered different levels of severity based on whether the virus infected the lungs and how many symptoms, such as cough, wheezing or shortness of breath, that participants reported.</p>



<p>In the placebo group, 14 participants developed lung infections with three or more symptoms. Only two participants who got the vaccine developed that level of illness for an <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2213836" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficacy of 85.7 percent</a>, Walsh and colleagues report April 5 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Against RSV lung infections with two or more symptoms, the vaccine had an efficacy of 66.7 percent, with 33 cases in the placebo group and 11 in the vaccine group.</p>



<p>Those efficacy numbers are lower but similar to those reported by GSK on February 16 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. But results from the vaccine trials are not directly comparable because they were conducted in different countries and used different measurements.</p>



<p>GSK tested its vaccine on about 25,000 participants age 60 and over from 17 countries across five continents. In the trial, seven people who got the company’s vaccine and 40 who got a placebo developed RSV lung infections with two or more symptoms lasting at least 24 hours. That is an <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2209604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efficacy of 82.6 percent</a>. The European Medicines Agency&#8217;s committee for human medicines&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/first-vaccine-protect-older-adults-respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv-infection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended the vaccine for approval</a>&nbsp;on the strength of those data.</p>



<p>Moderna hasn’t yet published results from its vaccine trial in a scientific or medical journal, but it issued a <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Announces-mRNA-1345-an-Investigational-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-RSV-Vaccine-Has-Met-Primary-Efficacy-Endpoints-in-Phase-3-Trial-in-Older-Adults/default.aspx#:~:text=Following%20review%20by%20an%20independent,by%20two%20or%20more%20symptoms." target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> in January with the numbers. The company gave its vaccine or a placebo to about 37,000 adults ages 60 and older in 22 countries. Only nine people in the vaccine group got lung infections with two or more symptoms compared with 55 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 83.7 percent.</p>



<p>Bavarian Nordic gave healthy 18- to 50-year-olds a shot of vaccine or placebo and then purposely gave them RSV in a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-uk-first-human-challenge-trial-covid-19">human challenge trial</a> (<em>SN: 2/18/21</em>). The vaccine prevented symptomatic infections with <a href="https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/investor/news/news.aspx?news=6393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">79 percent efficacy</a>, the company reported in a press release in 2021. But that was among healthy younger adults who have less risk of severe complications than elderly people do.</p>



<p>Bavarian Nordic also conducted a clinical trial in the United States and Germany of 20,000 people age 60 and older. Results of the study should be available later this year, Costa said.</p>



<p>Without masking and social distancing, RSV probably isn’t going to disappear again. As for the new vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, they probably won’t stop RSV’s spread. But they may at least protect the most vulnerable among us against the virus’s worst effects.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">On January 16, inspectors from an environmental agency in western Colombia made some <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Link-1.pdf">troubling findings</a>. At a U.S.-funded facility supposed to be doing cutting-edge malaria research, researchers were keeping dozens of monkeys in dirty cages in poorly ventilated, over-lit enclosures. Several animals were smeared with feces. Some looked sick, and one was missing an eye. A fetid smell hung in the air. On the floor of a cage, a baby monkey lay dead.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t the first time <a href="https://inmuno.co/cic/es/fucep-fundacion-centro-de-primates/">Fundación Centro de Primates</a> (FUCEP) had run afoul of local authorities. In 2021, inspectors had turned up signs of “animal abuse” at the facility, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Centro+Internacional+De+Vacunas/@3.3031825,-76.4831794,175m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x8e309fbfada906ab:0x178c01c2d29f66d0!8m2!3d3.3034494!4d-76.4821417!16s%2Fg%2F11c205xq21">located</a> a few miles from the city of Cali, and found no veterinarian on site. Perhaps more damning, the researchers in charge did not have the permits required to experiment on or keep lab animals.</p>



<p>But the problems may run even deeper. According to an 18-months investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a U.S.-based animal-rights group, FUCEP&#8217;s parent organization, <a href="https://inmuno.co/cic/es/consorcio-2/">Caucaseco Scientific Research Consortium</a>, apparently also conducted research in people without valid ethics approvals. These allegations have not previously been described in the media.</p>



<span id="more-127001"></span>



<p>The consortium, which is run by Colombian husband-and-wife team Myriam Arévalo-Herrera and Sócrates Herrera, has received more than $17 million from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2003, along with other international funding, according to PETA.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about this married couple and their three kids who handle this consortium that they are portraying as if it were, let&#8217;s say, like a university campus with several schools, like independent and all, but it&#8217;s all the same business, managed with the same people,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthmagnoliamartinezpena">Magnolia Martínez</a> of PETA, who led the investigation.</p>



<p>A Google Maps <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Centro+Internacional+De+Vacunas/@3.3031825,-76.4831794,175m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x8e309fbfada906ab:0x178c01c2d29f66d0!8m2!3d3.3034494!4d-76.4821417!16s%2Fg%2F11c205xq21">aerial photo</a> of the consortium&#8217;s <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LINK-3.pdf">self-described &#8220;campus&#8221;</a> shows several buildings in a wooded area. One is a big house in a neat garden with a circular driveway, a swimming pool and some smaller structures. A former Caucaseco employee who spoke on condition of anonymity told Retraction Watch this was the residence of Herrera and Arévalo-Herrera. It was known as “la mansion,” the person said, and was usually off limits to the consortium’s staffers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Arévalo-Herrera nor Herrera responded to requests for comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">NIH every year provides <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105736">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in contracts or grants to foreign organizations for animal research. Although this funding comes with several requirements, such as meeting certain animal-welfare policies, NIH relies on self-reported information from award recipients to ensure compliance. According to a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105736.pdf">new report</a> from the U.S. Government Accountability Office:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>NIH does not take steps, such as conducting site visits or requiring third-party verification, to ascertain the reliability of this information. As a result, NIH may be missing opportunities to identify and respond to possible instances of noncompliance with animal care and use standards at foreign research facilities.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In December, Martínez sent <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LINK-2.pdf">a letter</a> to the NIH with a detailed summary of her findings. We reached out to the agency in March for comments and were told:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All animals used in NIH-funded research are protected by laws, regulations, and policies to ensure the greatest commitment to animal welfare. NIH takes very seriously all allegations of non-compliance and investigates every allegation. NIH has opened an investigation regarding the allegations sent by PETA. NIH does not comment on allegations while an investigation is underway. Information about OLAW&#8217;s compliance oversight procedures can be found at: https://olaw.nih.gov/sites/default/files/ComplianceOversightProc.pdf.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.fiscalia.gov.co/colombia/noticias/fiscalia-verifica-posible-maltrato-animal-en-centro-de-investigacion-que-utiliza-monos-para-sus-pruebas-cientificas-en-valle-del-cauca/">criminal investigation</a> by the Colombian attorney general into Herrera and Arévalo-Herrera’s activities is also underway. And the Colombian comptroller general said in a letter obtained by PETA that an audit of the government agency that funded the couple’s research for decades will <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LINK-5.pdf">take into account the “alleged irregularities”</a> at FUCEP.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The debacle at Caucaseco has been <a href="https://www.elpais.com.co/cali/monos-decomisados-a-centro-de-investigacion-caucaseco-siguen-en-cuarentena-cvc.html">covered</a> extensively in Colombia, but has received only <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/01/nih-gave-millions-to-researchers-accused-of-vax-development-scam/">scant</a> <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2023/02/10/exclusive-colombia-shuts-down-u-s-taxpayer-funded-lab-torturing-monkeys-research/">media</a> attention in the United States. Many of PETA&#8217;s <a href="https://headlines.peta.org/cruel-colombian-organizations/">findings</a> appear on its website, where the group has also published comprehensive documentation obtained through freedom-of-information requests to both public and private agencies in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What has not received media attention until now is PETA&#8217;s allegation that at least two dozen scientific publications coauthored by the Colombian research duo could be affected by fraud. Martínez said the papers cite research approvals by ethics committees – institutional review boards (IRBs) and institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) – that don&#8217;t seem to exist.</p>



<p>The articles appear in several journals, including <em>Nature Communications</em>, <em>Redox Biology</em>, <em>Vaccine</em>, <em>PLOS One</em>, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases </em>and others. Martínez said she contacted all the journals, describing her findings and highlighting the affected papers. In her emails, which Retraction Watch has seen, she wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Among the multiple troubling findings that PETA’s investigation documented are the lack of properly established IRB and IACUC. According to the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, there are no records of IRBs operating within the organizations controlled by Herrera and Arévalo. Also, [the researchers] have failed to produce any records related to a propely [sic] established and functional IACUC. Other findings have to do with violations of Colombian animal welfare laws and other regulations; discrepancies between salaries reported to NIAID [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases] and salaries actually paid to staff involved in NIAID-funded activities; apparent illegal capture of Aotus monkeys; dubious incorporation and management practices; unsupported statements in Herrera’s NIAID grant applications; alleged failures to comply with biosafety standards that resulted in an employee being infected multiple times with the malaria parasite; and alleged lack of scientific integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After PETA released its investigation, more ex-employees of Herrera and Arévalo have come forward with grave allegations such as how they were instructed to fill out blank informed consent forms in preparation for a potential audit and how in many cases it was impossible to know whose human samples they were handling since they lacked labels. According to these allegations, Herrera and Arévalo were not meeting basic standards of research with humans either.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Not all of the journals responded, although some promised to investigate.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/redox-biology/editorial-board/michael-davies-dphil">Michael Davies</a>, scientific integrity and ethics editor of <em>Redox Biology</em>, which in 2018 published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231718302556?via%3Dihub">a study</a> coauthored by the Colombian researchers, told Martínez in an email on March 30 that the journal agreed &#8220;that this case is very serious&#8221;:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have examined the paper that was published in Redox Biology and this does not appear to directly involve samples from the primate colony, but we take the comments regarding the alleged mishandled of human samples and manipulated data extremely seriously, and we would like to follow up on this aspect, as soon as we have more data on this aspect.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a follow-up email the next day, Davies added that the IRB problem:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>is a critical issue, but it is also one that we cannot easily assess on our own. So, as soon as you have any updates on this, please let us know, so that we can take the appropriate action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ripudaman Bains, team manager at <em>Nature Communications</em>, which published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29226-3">a clinical trial</a> by the Colombian researchers last year, told Martínez in an email from April 17:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Following your original email, my colleagues and I (in consultation with the Springer Nature Research Integrity team) performed an extensive investigation into the concerns that you raised regarding the IRB approval for this study and, as is standard process in such instances, we raised these concerns with Dr Herrera and Dr Arévalo. We have established that the authors did acquire approval from Centro Internacional de Vacunas’.</p>



<p>We have also reviewed the study protocols relating to the published work and concluded that they were appropriately evaluated. As a result of our investigation, we will not be taking further action with respect to this paper.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Martínez shot back:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As I mentioned in my initial communication, there are no records of properly established and functional IRBs affiliated with the organizations controlled by Herrera and Arévalo, including Centro Internacional de Vacunas. Colombian officials confirmed this to PETA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bains then requested &#8220;the contact information for the Colombian officials&#8221; to &#8220;be able to liaise with them directly.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retraction Watch emailed the <em>PLOS</em> journals for comments, but we have not heard back. Springer Nature, the publisher of <em>Nature Communications</em>, said it was looking into the case.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Elsevier, which publishes <em>Vaccine</em> and <em>Redox Biology</em>, told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We take these accusations seriously and are undertaking an in-depth investigation, but we cannot comment until the investigation is complete. If the allegations are upheld, we will take appropriate action.</p>
</blockquote>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/iStock-869270600-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Pregnancy, childbirth and caring for an infant can be stressful. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61276-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One in five women</a> experience mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression, during their pregnancy or after giving birth. This can have very serious consequences for women, their infants and their families. It is critical that we identify women who are struggling with their mental health so that we can offer help and support.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg192/chapter/Recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidelines</a> set out by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England recommend that all women should be asked about their mental health when they attend their first appointment in pregnancy and again soon after they give birth. In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05518-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our new paper</a>, we used responses to three national maternity surveys in England to find out whether women are being asked in accordance with the guidelines.</p>
<p>Over 13,000 women who gave birth between 2014 and 2020 took part in our <a href="https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/maternity-surveys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveys</a>. Across the three surveys, we found that between 17% and 20% of these women were not asked about their mental health during pregnancy and between 12% and 26% were not asked after they gave birth. We also found that women from ethnic minority backgrounds were less likely to be asked about their mental health, when compared to white women. This is important because if certain groups of women are less likely to be asked, then these same groups of women are less likely to be identified as needing support and less likely to receive treatment.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we don’t ask, then we risk missing vulnerable women who can be helped.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why are some women not asked about their mental health? Studies have shown that there are <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02646838.2016.1188278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barriers</a> for healthcare professionals when it comes to talking to women about mental health. These include time constraints during maternity appointments, lack of training and confidence to talk to women about their mental health, not knowing how to support women with symptoms or how to get help for women who need further input. There may be <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/evaluation-of-ethnic-disparities-in-detection-of-depression-and-anxiety-in-primary-care-during-the-maternal-period-combined-analysis-of-routine-and-cohort-data/98B959EF09DDEBED21FCE66489C23C56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional barriers</a> for healthcare professionals when it comes to talking about mental health with women from ethnic minority backgrounds. These include difficulties with language and communication and concerns over how cultural beliefs might affect perceptions and conversations about mental health.</p>
<p>And why is it so important? If we don’t ask, then we don’t know how many women are suffering from mental health problems around the time of pregnancy or who these women are. We therefore don’t know the scope of the problem, how the problem affects different groups of women, or whether we have adequate services and resources to meet the needs of all women needing support. We know that <a href="https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/assets/downloads/mbrrace-uk/reports/maternal-report-2022/MBRRACE-UK_Maternal_MAIN_Report_2022_v10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maternal suicide</a> remains the leading direct cause of death over the first year following pregnancy. This is a startling reminder of the importance of recognizing women who need help, and this may start with a simple question. If we don’t ask, then we risk missing vulnerable women who can be helped.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pets-owners-bond-pandemic-stress">Pets and people bonded during the pandemic. But owners were still stressed and lonely</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you feel like you bonded with your pet during the pandemic, you’re not alone.</p>



<p>Cat and dog owners in the United States <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gradually grew closer to their pets during the first two years of COVID-19</a>. But these furry friends didn’t ease their humans’ overall stress or loneliness, despite owners citing their pets’ positive influences, researchers report April 26 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>“The one very clear message is that the human-animal relationship is very complicated,” says veterinary epidemiologist Hsin-Yi Weng of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>





<p>When the coronavirus outbreak began, Weng and colleagues recognized it as an unfortunate but unique opportunity to explore the dynamics of pet ownership during a large-scale, disruptive event. The team launched a survey around mid-2020 asking about people’s stress, loneliness and relationships with their pets. Participants reflected on their emotions before the pandemic (February 2020) and during lockdown (April to June 2020). Follow-up surveys in September 2020 and quarterly throughout 2021 captured information about the reopening and recovery phases, respectively.</p>



<p>Analyzing responses from more than 4,200 individuals, the team found that cat and dog owners felt they steadily bonded with their pets between the pre-pandemic and recovery phases. Spending more time at home and isolated from other people might explain those strengthened relationships, the researchers say.</p>



<p>But pets’ effects on mental health were a little fuzzier. Although the authors expected pets to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/six-ways-beat-chronic-stress">buffer stress</a> and loneliness, people with fluffy companions had similar loneliness levels — and sometimes even higher stress levels — compared with non–pet owners (<em>SN: 2/20/15</em>). The results did suggest though that having a pet buffered the loneliness related to romantic relationships, or lack thereof.</p>



<p>On average, people without pets reported the lowest amounts of stress while cat owners had the highest. Affording veterinary and everyday care, especially during lockdown, may have contributed to pet owners’ stress, the team suggests.</p>



<p>“There are two sides of having a pet,” Weng says. While they provide companionship, pets also add extra responsibilities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rosalind-franklin-dna-structure-watson-crick">What was Rosalind Franklin’s true role in the discovery of DNA’s double helix?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rosalind Franklin’s role in the discovery of the structure of DNA may have been different than previously believed. Franklin wasn’t the victim of data theft at the hands of James Watson and Francis Crick, say biographers of the famous duo. Instead, she collaborated and shared data with Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins.</p>



<p>Seventy years ago, a trio of scientific papers announcing the discovery of DNA’s double helix was published. Watson, Crick and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1962 for the finding. Franklin, a chemist and X-ray crystallographer, died of ovarian cancer before the prize was awarded and was not eligible to be included.</p>





<p>Many people have been outraged by accounts that Watson and Crick used Franklin’s unpublished data without her knowledge or consent in making their model of DNA’s molecular structure. What’s more, Franklin supposedly did not understand the significance of an X-ray diffraction image, taken by her graduate student, that came to be known as Photograph 51. Wilkins showed the image to Watson, who is said to have instantly recognized it as proof that DNA forms a double helix. And the rest is history.</p>



<p>Except that history is wrong, say Watson and Crick biographers Nathaniel Comfort and Matthew Cobb. Cobb is a zoologist at the University of Manchester in England, and Comfort, of Johns Hopkins University, is a historian of science and medicine. They uncovered historical documents among Franklin’s papers that they say should change the view of her contribution to the discovery.</p>



<p>Among the documents was an unpublished article from <em>Time</em> magazine depicting Watson and Crick as a team collaborating with Franklin and Wilkins, who were working as a pair. Overlooked letters and a program from a presentation to the United Kingdom’s Royal Society reinforced the idea that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01313-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franklin was a willing colleague who understood her data</a>. The researchers laid out their findings in a commentary in the April 27 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Cobb and Comfort talked with <em>Science News</em> about their new view of Franklin’s contributions. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Why did you decide to go through these documents?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> Matthew&#8217;s writing this biography of Crick, and I am writing a biography of Watson&#8230;. And we decided as a kind of pilgrimage to go and see the Franklin papers in person….</p>



<p>We weren&#8217;t expecting really anything other than just sort of a perfunctory visit when we sat down in this archive room together, and they pulled out the folders. We started going over them together, bouncing ideas back and forth saying, “Hey, what&#8217;s this?”</p>





<p>The sparks started flying, and that was when we found this magazine article from <em>Time</em> that was never published. It was a very rough draft that the author, named Joan Bruce, had sent to Franklin for fact-checking to make sure she got the science right.</p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> So what Nathaniel immediately picked up on in the Bruce article was the way that she presented the discovery. She presents it as being an equal piece of work — that the two groups, at King’s [College with Franklin and Wilkins] and at the Cavendish [Laboratory with Watson and Crick] in Cambridge, are effectively collaborating….</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not [the story] we&#8217;re used to hearing because the version we have is the dramatic Jim Watson version from his book <em>The Double Helix:</em> “Ha-ha! I stole their data!… Little did they know but I had it in my hands.” This is dramatic reconstruction.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> If it were this way [as in Bruce’s article], it actually gives the lie to Watson&#8217;s sensational account. And we know why — or at least I think I know why — Watson gave that sensational account.</p>



<p>The audience for <em>The Double Helix</em> was intended to be high school and college students who he wanted to get excited about science.… And I have lots of examples from that book where he stretches the truth, where he takes liberties, where he takes literary license. And I can show that as a pattern through the entire book. So it also fits with the style and tone of <em>The Double Helix</em>.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> <strong>Is there other evidence that Watson and Crick didn’t steal her data?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> &nbsp;What we have separately done by looking in real detail at the records — the interviews that Crick did in the ’60s and so on — is we’ve been able to reconstruct the process that [Watson and Crick] went through. Which, if you read their papers really carefully, actually says quite explicitly that they engaged in what they called a process of trial and error. So they knew roughly the size of the crystal of the DNA molecule. They knew the atoms that should be in there from the density. So they tried to fit this stuff into this size using chemical rules.</p>



<p>Then there’s this report [on X-ray diffraction data] that was written by the King’s researchers, Franklin and Wilkins, as part of their funding from the Medical Research Council. It was shared with other laboratories, including the head of the laboratory in Cambridge, Max Perutz [Crick’s boss]. And this is all known, so we haven’t discovered this. Watson and Crick used some of the numbers in there from Franklin and Wilkins as a kind of check on their random walk-through of possible structures….</p>



<p>This still looks like kind of underhand, right? Because they&#8217;ve been given this semi-official document. Then two things happened. Firstly, if you read their documents, it&#8217;s quite clear that they do explain that they had access to this document, and that they used it as a check on their models. So this fact is acknowledged at the time….</p>



<p>We then stumbled upon a letter from a Ph.D. student who was at King’s College, called Pauline Cowan, who was a friend of Crick&#8217;s…. So Cowan writes this letter asking him for help with something completely uninteresting. Then she says in passing, “Franklin and Gosling” — that&#8217;s Franklin&#8217;s Ph.D. student who took Photograph 51 — “are giving a seminar on their data.” This is in January 1953. “You can come along if you want. Here&#8217;s the details. But they say that they&#8217;re not really going to go into much detail. It&#8217;s for the general lab audience, and Perutz knows all the results anyway. So you might not want to bother coming.”</p>



<p>In other words, Franklin knows that Watson and Crick will have access to this informal report, and she doesn’t care. It’s all, “Hey, if you want it, that’s fine.” So that then shifts the optic away from they got this surreptitious access to this MRC report. So we’re back to this collaborative [picture]. Franklin doesn’t seem to be too bothered.</p>



<p>And then the final element … we found a program of a Royal Society exhibition…. This is two months after the publication of the papers. [In the program] is a brief summary of the structure of DNA signed by everybody, presented by Franklin.</p>



<p>It was like a school science fair. She’s standing there in front of a model explaining it to everybody, and all their names are on it. So this isn’t a race that’s been won by Watson and Crick. I mean, they did get there first, don’t get us wrong. But it wasn’t seen that way at the time. They could not have done it without the data from Franklin. And Wilkins. And everybody — at least at this stage in 1953 — is accepting that and seems okay with it.</p>



<p>Just like the Joan Bruce article said. So this changes the mood, right? We’re moving away from the Hollywood thriller that Watson wrote, where he’s sneaked some data. That version is really exciting. It’s just not true. [We’re moving] to something that’s much more collaborative, modern in some respects, about sharing data.</p>



<p>Today, we focus on Franklin because we’re currently interested in equality, women’s oppression, and so on. We’re also obsessed with DNA. But people weren’t back then. DNA wasn’t then what it is now. [People might think] how could Franklin not have been livid? This was the secret of life and she had had it taken away from her. But it wasn’t and she didn’t.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>Did Franklin understand the importance of her data?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> Franklin was very skilled at being able to move DNA between two forms; what’s called the A form, which is the crystalline form which gives really precise images, and what’s called the B form. That form is what you get if there’s much more water around the molecule kind of pulling it into a different shape. And it was very clear from her notes that she thought that the B form was basically the loss of order, that it was disintegrating….</p>

The image, dubbed Photograph 51, is said to have inspired James Watson to realize that DNA is a double helix.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123991">Science History Images / Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you study the double helix story, there’s this this kind of enigma, because there are these two forms, A and B.&nbsp; Franklin studies the A form … [but] it’s never been clear to anybody why she chose that form. And then we realized it’s because she’s a crystallographer. She’s a chemist. And if you’re a chemist, and you’re trying to find the crystalline structure of something, what are you going to look at? The crystal.</p>



<p>It’s easy in retrospect to get in a time machine and go back and whisper in her ear, “Hey, but what’s the inside of the cell like? It’s not very dry, you know. Maybe think about the other form.” But … you can’t do that. That’s against the rules….</p>



<p>Everybody who wants to favor Rosalind Franklin thinks that Watson and Crick were kind of sexist pigs who stole her data. The first bit of that description is probably accurate. The second bit isn’t. They certainly were pretty rude. But they did not steal the data.</p>



<p>This is the popular version of the story which we wanted to undermine. That this Photograph 51, which is the B form, is so striking that Watson, when he’s given a glimpse of it, can instantly realize its significance. According to the story he tells and people who are in favor of Franklin tell, this is the moment he steals her data.</p>



<p>But if you think about it for a minute, you think, “Well, why didn’t Franklin get it if it’s so obvious? This really smart woman who’s much smarter than Watson is about this aspect of science, but she doesn’t get it?” And the answer is very clear when you read her notes. She did get it and she didn’t care. She knew it was some kind of helix, but that was not the structure that interested her.</p>



<p>What [the popular story] does is it removes any agency from Franklin. People are inadvertently presenting her as a negative version, the version that Watson presents. She’s the heroine, but she hasn’t gotten it yet. Why hasn’t she got it? Well, the only implication is what Wilkins says; that she was stubborn and blinkered, which is just not true. So we’re trying to put her back at the center of the story, make her much more human than this harridan that Watson presents her as.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>Do we know if Franklin complained at the time about her data being stolen?</strong></p>



<p>So after the double helix [discovery], Franklin and Wilkins never question Watson and Crick, “How did you do this?” They never fall out with them. They never have a row. They never write anything. Either they were stupid and never asked the question, or they knew [that the data were shared fairly].</p>



<p>Then in [19]54, for example, Franklin’s going to the East Coast to go to this meeting on the West Coast that Watson’s going to as well. And so she writes to Watson, “Dear Jim, I gather you’re getting a car across the states. Can I come with you?” So she tried to hitch a ride on a transcontinental car journey with this man who supposedly had stolen life’s secret from under her nose. That doesn’t make sense.</p>



<p>She was on collegial terms — I don’t think she liked him — but she was on collegial terms with Jim…. They had extensive correspondence because they were in the same area of viral structure.</p>



<p>In the last two or three years of her life, she became very good friends with Crick and with his wife. They went on holiday together in Spain after a conference. After she had her first two operations for ovarian cancer, she went to the Cricks to convalesce. She would send Crick her draft articles and ask his advice. So she clearly didn’t think he was a pig who was going to steal all of that data.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>So they were just much more chill about the whole thing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cobb:</strong> They were all much more chill. We look at this, one, through a feminist optic. We being the world. It’s an inverse version of <em>The Double Helix</em>. And, two, through the optic of what would it be like today to discover this? Clearly, you&#8217;d have competing labs, they would not talk to each other, and if one of them had these data, then they would behave exactly like Watson describes it.</p>



<p>But that was not the world of the 1950s. Partly because DNA was not DNA. It wasn&#8217;t clear that it was the genetic material [of life]. So it wasn&#8217;t a big deal.</p>



<p>On Franklin’s tomb there is no mention of DNA. What there is mention of is viruses. &nbsp;Because that&#8217;s the practical work that she was engaged in when she died. She had worked out the structure of the polio virus. DNA wasn&#8217;t a practical thing for another 20 years. Whereas the structure the polio virus, maybe that could save lives.</p>



<p>The way we see her is not how she was seen at the time. She was very famous. She got a page obituary in <em>Nature</em>, obituaries in Britain’s the <em>Times</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. So many of her American colleagues were utterly distraught when they discovered that she died [in 1958]. So you know, she was a very significant person, not just for DNA.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>:</strong> Dr. Watson is still living. Have you spoken with him or anyone else who’s still around that could offer some insight?</p>



<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> I&#8217;ve spoken with him many times, and he knows about this project. But he&#8217;s not in any [physical] shape right now to be able to comment on something like this. Believe me, I would love to, but it&#8217;s just not possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/native-language-shape-musical-ability">Native language might shape musical ability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Your mother tongue may modify your musical ability.</p>



<p>Speaking a native language that requires tones appears to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.03.067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boost perception of melody, but at the cost of rhythm</a>, researchers report April 26 in <em>Current Biology</em>. The massive global study hints at how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-wires-native-language-neurons">language skills seep into other areas of cognition</a> (<em>SN: 3/29/23</em>).</p>



<p>Tonal languages use pitch to distinguish words that otherwise might sound the same. In Mandarin, for instance, mă means horse whereas mā means mother. Nontonal languages like Spanish sometimes include pitch changes to suggest emotion, for example, but not to change a word’s meaning.</p>





<p>As a Mandarin speaker and flutist, Jingxuan Liu wondered about the crossover between language and music. While studying psychology as an undergraduate at Duke University, Liu helped analyze the musical abilities of nearly half a million people from 203 countries. Her colleagues had launched an online game in which participants completed several musical tasks, including identifying matching melodies at different pitches and finding beat tracks that fit songs’ rhythms.</p>



<p>On average, native speakers of the 19 represented tonal languages were better at the melody task compared with speakers of 29 nontonal languages. And the effect wasn’t small — a tonal first language enhanced melodic perception by about half the amount that music lessons did, which was also surveyed. But tonal language speakers tended to be worse at the rhythm task.</p>



<p>Humans must be choosy about what they pay attention to. Pitch patterns are vital in tonal languages, which might explain the musical trade-off. “You’ve got a finite resource of attention, and you’ve got to allocate that somehow,” says study coauthor Courtney Hilton, a cognitive scientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Prior research on language and music often compared just two tongues, usually English and Cantonese or Mandarin. But other cultural influences, such as Eastern and Western music styles, could have affected results. By examining a wide range of people, the new study included languages never assessed in this way and reached more generalizable conclusions.</p>



<p>“Our result here is showing that the language someone speaks — which is an important part of culture — also shapes cognition,” Hilton says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permafrost-thawing-pollution-arctic-climate-change">Thawing permafrost may unleash industrial pollution across the Arctic</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the Arctic’s icebound ground warms, it may unleash toxic substances across the region.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, the thaw threatens to destabilize facilities at more than 2,000 industrial sites, such as mines and pipelines, and further compromise <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37276-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 5,000 already contaminated areas</a>, researchers report March 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>Those numbers come from the first comprehensive study to pinpoint where Arctic permafrost thaw could release industrial pollutants. But there are probably even more contaminated areas that we don’t know about, says permafrost researcher Moritz Langer of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, Germany. “We only see the tip of the iceberg.”</p>





<p>Toxic substances released from these locations could jeopardize fish and other animals living in Arctic waterways, as well as the health of people who depend on them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-permafrost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Permafrost</a> is any soil, sediment or rock that remains frozen for at least two years. Step on the ground in the Arctic and chances are that permafrost lies underfoot. For decades, people have treated the frozen earth as staunch and largely immobile. Industries constructed infrastructure atop its firmness, and within it they buried their refuse and sludge. In some places, scientists and others have used permafrost to store radioactive waste.</p>



<p>But the Arctic is warming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">nearly four times as fast</a> as the rest of the planet as a result of climate change, and as much as 65 percent of the region’s permafrost may disappear by 2100 (<em>SN: 8/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>That could release some worrisome things, says climate scientist Kimberley Miner of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the study. In 2021, Miner and her colleagues warned that the thawing of Arctic permafrost <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01162-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could release</a> antibiotic-resistant bacteria, viruses and radioactive waste from nuclear-testing programs into the environment.</p>



<p>Keen to identify where the warming could spread industrial pollutants, Langer and his colleagues first analyzed the range of Arctic permafrost and whereabouts of industrial infrastructure. They identified about 4,500 sites — including oil fields, mines and abandoned military installations — in places where permafrost probably exists. Next, the team used contamination data from Alaska and Canada — regions with accessible records — and found that as of January 2021, about 3,600 contaminated locations occupy the two regions. These include waste areas and places where pollutants were accidentally released.</p>



<p>Realistically, these numbers are probably deflated, Langer says, because many incidents of contamination have probably gone undocumented.</p>





<p>Focusing on Alaska, the researchers found that diesel, gasoline and related petrochemicals make up about half of the pollutants reported. Lead, arsenic and mercury — substances toxic to fish, people and other organisms — were reported too. But in many cases, the type of pollutant was not documented. “That’s a big problem,” Langer says, in part because it makes understanding the risks of a particular leak or spill much harder.</p>



<p>Using the locations of industrial sites and North American contamination data, Langer and colleagues extrapolated where industrial contamination and permafrost might coexist across the entirety of the Arctic, finding 13,000 to 20,000 such sites may exist today. Then, they used computer simulations to investigate the impact of current and future levels of climate change.</p>



<p>Today, there may already be a risk of permafrost degrading at about 1,000 of the known industrial sites and 2,200 to 4,800 of the known and estimated contaminated locations, they found.</p>



<p>In a low-emissions scenario in which warming rises by up to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, those numbers increase to more than 2,100 industrial sites and 5,600 to 10,000 contaminated areas. An increase of about 4.3 degrees C would probably affect almost all the known and projected locations.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re going to need to think about keeping [pollutants] where they need to be,” Miner says, “not just leaving them on the landscape where we feel like.”</p>



<p>The new findings are probably conservative, Langer says, partly because the analysis didn’t consider that infrastructure itself can warm the ground. What’s more, even if it doesn’t fully thaw, “warming of the permafrost causes quite a bit of problem,” says civil engineer Guy Doré of Université Laval in Quebec City, who wasn’t involved in the study. Permafrost that warms from –5° C to –2° C can lose half of its load-bearing capacity, he says, destabilizing infrastructure.</p>



<p>Today, no international regulations mandate industries in the Arctic to document the substances they use and store, or what happens to them. Without that information, Langer says, it’ll be difficult to assess and manage the growing risk of contamination.</p>



<p>He plans to visit decades-old oil drilling facilities in Canada to study how the changing permafrost has affected the containment of drilling fluids. “That&#8217;s the next step,” he says, “to understand better how [industrial contaminants] spread into the landscape.”</p>

<p>Last week, we brought you the story of a professor who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/">found her name</a> on an article she didn’t write, which also seemed to have been plagiarized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since our story was published, we’ve learned a little more about the journal that published the article, the <em>African Journal of Political Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.buse.ac.zw/faculties/science/geography-department/prof-jephias-mapuva/">Jephias Mapuva</a>, a professor at the Bindura University of Science Education in Zimbabwe, who is listed as the <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/editorial-board.html">editor in chief of the journal</a>, told us in an email that he is “not associated with the journal in any way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It came to me as a surprise that I am listed as an Editor-In-Chief,” he wrote. He also copied an email address for the journal publisher, International Scholars Journal, and asked for his name to be removed from the website:&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126985"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>THIS IS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING and an inconvenience on my profile.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The journal’s <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/editorial-board.html">editorial board</a> also includes a couple of engineering professors and a “Commercial Manager of Multifarious Projects Group” in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As commenters on our original story pointed out, another <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps"><em>African Journal of Political Science</em></a> exists with the same ISSN listed on the International Scholars Journals website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its information page states the publication is an open-access journal that does not charge article processing fees, and is an outlet of the African Association of Political Science. The journal seems to have <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps/issue/archive">restarted publishing last year</a>, after halting in 2004. The International Scholars Journals publication has <a href="https://www.internationalscholarsjournals.com/african-journal-political-science/archive.html">put out issues</a> continuously since 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.uj.ac.za/members/siphamandla-zondi/">Siphamandla Zondi</a>, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, who is listed as <a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajps/about/editorialTeam">editor in chief</a> of the <em>African Journal of Political Science</em> not affiliated with International Scholars Journals, has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>International Scholars Journals is included on Jeffrey Beall’s list of “potentially predatory journals and publishers,” other commenters noted. Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado, Denver, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/01/17/bealls-list-potential-predatory-publishers-go-dark/">took down the list</a> in 2017, but <a href="https://beallslist.net/">archived versions</a> remain online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenter <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/18/a-professor-found-her-name-on-an-article-she-didnt-write-then-it-got-worse/#comment-2160242">Chung-Chuan Lo</a> shared a link to an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/scam-journal-pretending-real-thing-nadine-bekkouche/">account</a> of another academic’s encounter with the alleged <em>African Journal of Political Science</em>. She described what happened after submitting a commentary, at the journal’s invitation:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Then the hustle for money started. The price was initially over 1000 euros. Obscene. Then they called me (!), they kept emailing, they would not hear my (several) requests to withdraw the article, and they are still emailing. This is frankly abusive. Oh, and they tried to charge a withdrawal fee, before deciding to keep the article. This sort of harassement qualifies the operation as fraudulent and engaging in spearphishing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As for why the journal published an article attributed to someone who didn’t write it, several commenters speculated that the publisher was attempting to fill issues with copy and apply a veneer of respectability with the name of a legitimate academic. We’ve <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/12/29/meet-the-publisher-making-the-science-of-bronte-faulkner-and-whitman-available-for-the-first-time/">previously reported</a> on similar attempts using the names of famous authors including Walt Whitman and Charlotte Brontë.</p>

                <p>In keeping with the grand tradition of tubby cats, a newly created quantum “cat” is particularly massive — at least for the quantum realm.</p>



<p>Scientists put a jiggling piece of sapphire crystal in what’s known as a “cat state,” in which an object exists in two different states simultaneously. It’s a situation reminiscent of physicists’ favorite imaginary feline, Schrödinger’s cat, known for being alive and dead at the same time.</p>



<p>The new sapphire cat <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf7553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a relatively hefty 16 micrograms</a>, physicists report in the April 21 <em>Science</em>. That’s close to half the mass of an eyelash, and more than 100 trillion times the mass of cat states previously created with molecules. “We’ve reached a new regime where quantum mechanics apparently does work,” says physicist Yiwen Chu of ETH Zurich.</p>





<p>In a quantum parable dreamt up in the 1930s by physicist Erwin Schrödinger, a cat is trapped in a box and, due to quantum effects, winds up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/schrödingers-cat-now-dead-and-alive-two-boxes-once">alive and dead at the same time</a> (<em>SN: 5/26/16</em>). This paradoxical scenario doesn’t happen in the real world. While quantum particles are capable of existing in two distinct states simultaneously — what’s called a superposition — those effects wash out for cat-sized stuff.</p>



<p>Quantum effects are typically confined to atoms, molecules and the like. The everyday world visible to human eyes doesn’t exhibit quantum properties. Scientists can coax certain tiny objects to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spooky-quantum-entanglement-goes-big-new-experiments">display quantum features</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/18</em>). But scientists don’t fully understand the border between the quantum and nonquantum realms.</p>



<p>“We really have only just begun to understand that intermediate regime,” says Benjamin Sussman of the University of Ottawa, who was not involved with the new study. “It’s of really profound interest to see how these quantum systems scale and how they behave.”</p>



<p>Cat states are a special variety of quantum behavior that come close to re-creating Schrödinger’s idea. They are superpositions of two states that are distinct according to the classical physics that describes the everyday world— like an alive or dead cat — rather than two states that exist only in the quantum domain, such as the energy levels of an atom.</p>



<p>In the new experiment, the researchers jiggled a portion of a sapphire crystal in such a way that its atoms moved in two directions at once. That’s a distinction that “captures the spirit” of Schrödinger’s cat, Chu says.</p>



<p>The jiggling was confined within a sliver of the crystal consisting of 100 million billion atoms. That’s large enough that, if extracted from the rest of the crystal, it would be visible to the naked eye, Chu says.</p>





<p>Still, the oscillations of the atoms were tiny, about a millionth of a billionth of a millimeter — not exactly the scale of everyday objects. Other demonstrations of cat states have demonstrated much larger spatial separation, despite being made up of fewer atoms.</p>



<p>In future work, Sussman says he’d like to see the researchers scale up not only the mass, but also the size of the oscillations. “That’s going to be really hard but will be really interesting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-trees-drought-survival-secrets">Ultrasound reveals trees’ drought-survival secrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>The tissues of living trees may hold the secrets of why some can recover after drought and others die. But those tissues are challenging to assess in mature forests. After all, 90-year-old trees can’t travel to the lab to get an imaging scan. So most studies of the impacts of drought on plants are done in the lab and on younger trees — or by gouging cores out of mature trees.</p>



<p>Barbara Beikircher, an ecophysiologist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, and colleagues came up with a different approach: They brought the lab to the trees.</p>



<p>In the Kranzberg Forest outside Munich, the team outfitted stands of mature spruce and beech trees with rugged, waterproof ultrasound sensors. Some of the stands had been covered by roofs to block the summer rain, creating artificial drought conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="500" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1.jpg" alt="A photo of several trees with ultrasound equipment strapped to the trunks and short green fences surrounding the trees." class="wp-image-3123551" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-521x383.jpg 521w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-612x450.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/040423_kb_treeultrasound_inline1-253x186.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3123551">Researchers outfitted stands of mature spruce and beech trees with ultrasound sensors and electrical probes to figure how the species cope with long dry spells.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3123551">University of Innsbruck</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Five years of monitoring revealed that beeches (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>) are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/plb.13444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more drought-resilient than spruces</a> (<em>Picea abies</em>), the team reported in the December <em>Plant Biology</em>. Delving into the underlying mechanisms explained this difference.</p>



<p>Drought-stressed trees produced more ultrasound signals than trees exposed to summer rains. Those faint acoustic waves were bouncing off air bubbles called embolisms deep within the trees’ vasculature. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-sap-water-power-energy-world">Surface tension keeps water moving</a> through a tree’s thousands of tiny vessels — evaporation from pores in leaves drives water up the trunk (<em>SN: 9/6/22</em>). But if there’s insufficient water in the soil, this upward pull can generate embolisms that clog vessels. In the experiments, spruces pinged much more than beeches, suggesting they had far more embolisms.</p>





<p>That’s despite the fact that beeches appear to be less conservative with their water management, at least aboveground. Trees can prevent embolisms by closing the pores on their leaves, but there’s a trade-off. Doing so cuts off the supply of the carbon dioxide that drives photosynthesis, which makes the carbohydrates and sugars that trees need to live and grow. In dry conditions, trees face an impossible choice “between starving and dying of thirst,” Beikircher says.</p>



<p>Beeches suffered fewer embolisms than the spruce, even though they kept their pores open longer than the conifers did. Perhaps that’s because beeches have roots that extend into deeper, wetter soil as well as more robust water reserves, Beikircher says. Another set of experiments after the researchers relieved the drought suggests that’s the case.</p>



<p>At the end of the experiment, the team drenched the soil. All the trees recovered well by most measures: Rates of photosynthesis in the previously parched trees caught up to the rates of trees in the control groups and embolisms filled with water.</p>



<p>But when Beikircher measured the trees’ resistance to an electrical current, an indication of moisture levels deep within trunks, the spruces’ water reserves were still depleted. One season of rain was not enough to help these trees fully recover. It’s unclear whether spruces can replenish their reserves after prolonged drought or how long that might take.</p>





<p>Species that can withstand drought conditions and recover more quickly may become more populous in future forests as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate change causes droughts to become more frequent</a> and intense (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). That means the compositions of the trees that make up the world’s temperate forests could change as the climate warms, with uncertain consequences for the other plants and animals in these ecosystems.</p>



<p>Beikircher plans to test whether a more diverse forest could help drought-sensitive species like the spruce survive. Deep-rooted beeches interspersed with spruces might help increase moisture in the soil’s upper levels by wicking water up to where spruce roots are, she says.</p>

<p><em>We are pleased to present an excerpt from <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/distrust-9780192868459?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Distrust: Big Data, Data-Torturing, and the Assault on Science</a>, a new book by Pomona College economics professor <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/gary-n-smith">Gary Smith</a>. The Washington Post said the book&#8217;s lessons &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/03/23/smith-distrust-review-data-disinformation/">are very much needed</a></em>.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The fact that changes in bitcoin prices are driven by fear, greed, and manipulation has not stopped people from trying to crack their secret. Empirical models of bitcoin prices are a wonderful example of data torturing because bitcoins have no intrinsic value and, so, cannot be explained credibly by economic data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Undaunted by this reality, a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24877">National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) paper</a> reported the mind-boggling efforts made by Yale University economics professor <a href="https://economics.yale.edu/people/aleh-tsyvinski">Aleh Tsyvinski</a> and a graduate student, Yukun Liu, to find empirical patterns in bitcoin prices.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-126972"></span>



<p>Tsyvinski currently holds an endowed chair named after Arthur M. Okun, who had been a professor at Yale from 1961 to 1969, though he spent six of those eight years on leave so that he could work in Washington on the Council of Economic Advisors as a staff economist, council member, and then chair, advising presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on their economic policies. He is most well known for Okun’s law, which states that a 1 percentage-point reduction in unemployment will increase U.S. output by roughly 2 percent, an argument that helped persuade President Kennedy that using tax cuts to reduce unemployment from 7 to 4 percent would have an enormous economic payoff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Okun’s death, an anonymous donor endowed a lecture series at Yale named after Okun, explaining that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Arthur Okun combined his special gifts as an analytical and theoretical economist with his great concern for the well-being of his fellow citizens into a thoughtful, pragmatic, and sustaining contribution to his nation’s public policy.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The contrast between Okun’s focus on meaningful economic policies and Tsyvinski’s far-fetched bitcoin calculations is striking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liu and Tsyvinski report correlations between the number of weekly Google searches for the word bitcoin (compared to the average over the past four weeks) and the percentage changes in bitcoin prices one to seven weeks later. They also looked at the correlation between the weekly ratio of bitcoin hack searches to bitcoin searches and the percentage changes in bitcoin prices one to seven weeks later. The fact that they reported bitcoin search results looking back four weeks and forward seven weeks should alert us to the possibility that they tried other backward-and-forward combinations that did not work as well. Ditto with the fact that they did not look back four weeks with bitcoin hack searches. They evidently tortured the data in their quest for correlations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, only seven of their fourteen correlations seemed promising for predicting bitcoin prices. Owen Rosebeck and I looked at the predictions made by these correlations during the year following their study and found that they were useless. They might as well have flipped coins to predict bitcoin prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liu and Tsyvinski also calculated the correlations between the number of weekly Twitter bitcoin posts and bitcoin returns one to seven weeks later. Unlike the Google trends data, they did not report results for bitcoin hack posts. Three of the seven correlations seemed useful, though two were positive and one was negative. With fresh data, none were useful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only thing that their data abuse yielded was coincidental statistical correlations. Even though the research was done by an eminent Yale professor and published by the prestigious NBER, the idea that bitcoin prices can be predicted reliably from Google searches and Twitter posts was a fantasy fueled by data torturing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The irony here is that scientists created statistical tools that were intended to ensure the credibility of scientific research but have had the perverse effect of encouraging researchers to torture data—which makes their research untrustworthy and undermines the credibility of all scientific research.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Traditionally, empirical research begins by specifying a theory and then collecting appropriate data for testing the theory. Many now take the shortcut of looking for patterns in data unencumbered by theory. This is called data mining in that researchers rummage through data, not knowing what they will find.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Way back in 2009, Marc Prensky, a writer and speaker with degrees from Yale and Harvard Business School, claimed that&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In many cases, scientists no longer have to make educated guesses, construct hypotheses and models, and test them with data-based experiments and examples. Instead, they can mine the complete set of data for patterns that reveal effects, producing scientific conclusions without further experimentation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We are hard-wired to seek patterns but the data deluge makes the vast majority of patterns waiting to be discovered illusory and useless. Bitcoin is again a good example. Since there is no logical theory (other than greed and market manipulation) that explains fluctuations in bitcoin prices, it is tempting to look for correlations between bitcoin prices and other variables without thinking too hard about whether the correlations make sense. In addition to torturing data, Liu and Tsyvinski mined their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They calculated correlations between bitcoin prices and 810 other variables, including such whimsical items as the Canadian dollar–U.S. dollar exchange rate, the price of crude oil, and stock returns in the automobile, book, and beer industries. You might think I am making this up. Sadly, I am not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They reported finding that bitcoin returns were positively correlated with stock returns in the consumer goods and health care industries and negatively correlated with stock returns in the fabricated products and metal mining industries. These correlations don’t make any sense and Liu and Tsyvinski admitted that they had no idea why these data were correlated: “We don’t give explanations . . . . We just document this behavior.” A skeptic might ask: What is the point of documenting coincidental correlations?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that is all they found. The Achilles heel of data mining is that large data sets inevitably contain an enormous number of coincidental correlations that are just fool’s gold in that they are no more useful than correlations among random numbers. Most fortuitous correlations do not hold up with fresh data, though some, coincidentally, will for a while. One statistical relationship that continued to hold during the period they studied and the year afterward was a negative correlation between bitcoin returns and stock returns in the paperboard-containers-and-boxes industry. This is surely serendipitous—and pointless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have assembled enormous databases and created powerful computers and algorithms for analyzing data. The irony is that these resources make it very easy to use data mining to discover chance patterns that are fleeting. Results are reported and then discredited, and we become increasingly skeptical of scientists.</p>

                <p>Mars’ heart is about the size of our moon, and almost twice as dense. Or so suggest the first observed rumblings from a Marsquake and meteorite impact to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217090120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross the Red Planet’s heart</a>, researchers report April 24 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The penetrative reverberations allowed researchers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">refine estimates of the core’s size, density and composition</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Nobody&#8217;s ever seen before a seismic wave going through [Mars’] core,” says seismologist Jessica Irving from the University of Bristol in England. “We waited for more than 900 days for one quake on the farside,” she says. Then “24 days later, there was … a meteorite impact.”</p>

<p>Both were captured by NASA’s InSight lander, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-dart-artemis-space-news-2022">monitored seismic activity on Mars</a> for four years, up until December 2022 (<em>SN: 12/20/22</em>). Over its 1,480-day career, the lander captured the quivers of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-volcanic-activity-planet-nasa-insight">over 1,000 Marsquakes</a> and a handful of impacts (<em>SN: 11/3/22</em>). But in all that time, it detected just two rumblings on the planet’s farside.</p>



<p>Analyzing the core-crossing seismicity from the two events, Irving and her colleagues found that Mars’ heart has a radius of 1,780 to 1,810 kilometers with a density of about 6,200 kilograms per cubic meter. That radius is slightly smaller than previously estimated, and about half that of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-complex-seismology">combined layers of Earth’s heart</a> (<em>SN: 3/16/23</em>). The cores of both planets comprise about half of their total thickness.</p>



<p>Moreover, the researchers inferred that Mars’ core is mostly made of a liquid iron alloy, with sulfur making up about 15 percent of its mass. A smattering of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon together comprise about 5 percent. The findings roughly align with some previous analyses of Martian meteorite compositions.</p>
