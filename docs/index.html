                <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image-1024x538.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132076" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image-1024x538.png 1024w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image-300x158.png 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image-768x403.png 768w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lacour-retraction-main-image.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A study on how conversations can change minds grabbed headlines when it was published — and again five months later when retracted.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Gay Advocates Can Shift Same-Sex Marriage Views,” read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/health/gay-marriage-canvassing-study-science.html?_r=0">the <em>New York Times</em> headline</a>. “Doorstep visits change attitudes on gay marriage,” <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-gay-canvassing-20141211-story.html">declared the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>. “Cure Homophobia With This One Weird Trick!” <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/12/homophobes-support-marriage-equality-when-gay-people-talk-to-them.html"><em>Slate</em> spouted</a>.</p>



<p>Driving those headlines was <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1256151">a December 2014 study</a> in <em>Science, </em>by Michael J. LaCour, then a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Donald Green, a professor at Columbia University.</p>



<p>Researchers praised the “buzzy new study,” as <em>Slate </em>called it at the time, for its robust effects and impressive results. The key finding: A brief conversation with a gay door-to-door canvasser could change the mind of someone opposed to same-sex marriage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time the study was published, David Broockman, then a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, had already seen LaCour’s results and was keen to pursue his own version of it. He and fellow graduate student Joshua Kalla had collaborated before and wanted to look more closely at the impact canvassing could have on elections. But as the pair deconstructed LaCour’s study to figure out how to replicate it, they hit several curious stumbling blocks. And when they got a hold of LaCour’s dataset, or replication package, they quickly realized the results weren’t adding up.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-132075"></span>



<p>The two graduate students found themselves in somewhat uncharted territory for how to share their critique. They wrote up their findings, recruiting help from Yale statistician P. Aronow. They shared the report with Green, the senior author on the paper, who confronted LaCour with the critique.</p>



<p>Then, the trio posted the report with its unassuming title, “<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/qy2se_v1">Irregularities in LaCour</a>,” online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was “like our personal Cuban Missile Crisis,” Broockman said in an interview with Retraction Watch last month. “There was basically this period between when our little PDF report went online and our little world exploded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their revelations about “statistical irregularities” and false statements triggered the paper’s downward spiral, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/20/author-retracts-study-of-changing-minds-on-same-sex-marriage-after-colleague-admits-data-were-faked/">cataloged in nearly real time</a> on Retraction Watch and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/121876/door-door-deception">widely</a> <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/how-a-grad-student-uncovered-a-huge-fraud.html">reported</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/science-retracts-gay-marriage-paper-without-agreement-lead-author-lacour">elsewhere</a>, culminating in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac6638">the paper’s official retraction</a> 10 years ago this week.</p>



<p>A decade later, Broockman, Kalla and Green continue to study persuasion in politics, among other topics. Their involvement in one of the most widely publicized retractions had some lasting effects on how they approach research. And the intervening years have also brought some welcome changes to research and data practices in their field.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘There’s no rule book for this’</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After Broockman and Kalla’s report went public, their peers were unsure how to react. “A lot of the fears we had felt like they were starting to come true,” said <a href="https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/david-edward-broockman">Broockman</a>, now an associate professor at Berkeley. “People were like, ‘is this the right thing to do? Was this the right procedure?’” he said. “We were like, ‘there’s no rule book for this.’”</p>



<p>The same is true today. Post-publication peer review has gained more prominence since 2014, thanks to data sleuths, PubPeer and other efforts to police the literature. This week, a team of sleuths <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/04/cosig-sleuths-publish-toolkit-post-publication-review/">published a series of 25 guides</a> on how to spot integrity issues. But a post on PubPeer is unlikely to draw attention beyond certain circles, and formal investigations trigger processes that move at an academic pace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think there&#8217;s still a cultural problem in academia — and there was at the time — there&#8217;s just a lot of costs associated with criticizing existing research,” Broockman said. “The stories that you&#8217;re worried people are going to tell about you, I think that remains a big deterrent for people to come forward with whatever issues they have. I think academia has made a little bit of progress on that and could make more.”</p>

<p>When Broockman and Kalla spoke with us, news had just broken that <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-163876634">MIT called for the withdrawal</a> of an AI study done by an economics graduate student. Kalla hadn’t been familiar with the research — which had not yet been published but was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17866">posted as a preprint</a> — or the university’s announcement. But he had read <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-163876634">Stuart Buck’s May 18 newsletter</a> recounting his critique of the study — and the backlash Buck faced for asking questions about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He got pushback for not following proper etiquette, for not being kind and understanding and kind of wrong to be questioning the research paper,” said <a href="https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/joshua-kalla">Kalla</a>, now an associate professor at Yale University. “I don&#8217;t know if the norms have changed over the last 10 years, but Stuart is raising some of those same concerns that we had 10 years ago.”</p>



<p>Sometimes, no matter which option a person chooses, there’s pushback, Broockman said.</p>



<p>“I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many people&#8217;s first instinct in these circumstances is to criticize the person raising the issue,” he said. “That&#8217;s really problematic. I think Stuart&#8217;s post shows that this remains a problem.”</p>



<p>Kalla said he encourages early-career researchers to take a direct, respectful approach when critiquing anyone’s work. “The key advice I give to graduate students is to have that kind of respect and curiosity, since oftentimes there aren&#8217;t the smoking guns that David and I had 10 years ago,” he said.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘The hero here is open data’</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2014, publishing datasets, code and documentation with research papers was relatively uncommon. But that’s ultimately what led Broockman and Kalla to realize the “irregularities” they had found with LaCour’s study execution were something more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The hero here is open data. That&#8217;s what led us to do this,” Broockman said. “This is one example – it&#8217;s an extreme example – of why open data is important.”</p>



<p>“Ten years ago, the idea of pre-analysis plans, the idea of open data, the idea that you need to have reasonable sample sizes and studies, that was much more like a fringe, vanguard thing,” Broockman said. “My sense is that in the three main social science quantitative fields of psychology, political science and economics, I think we won that war. I think that’s pretty universal now.”</p>

<p>Kalla was somewhat less certain. “I&#8217;m not sure if I would say the war is totally over. I think there&#8217;s definitely still lots of pushback, especially around both pre-analysis plans and statistical power,” he said. “There’s a perception that our job is to publish and to keep our jobs, and not necessarily to do the best research possible. And sometimes these scientific best practices come at odds with those competing goals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kalla and Broockman are meticulous researchers by nature, but their involvement in the <em>Science </em>retraction amplified that trait. “I think given the prominence of this retraction, I always feared people are going to double check my work,” Kalla said. “So I think that that made me always be careful, to try extra hard to make sure everything is buttoned down, everything is double and triple checked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Green acknowledged he didn’t do his due diligence as a coauthor, telling us <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/20/author-retracts-study-of-changing-minds-on-same-sex-marriage-after-colleague-admits-data-were-faked/">at the time</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Convinced that the results were robust, I helped Michael LaCour write up the findings, especially the parts that had to do with the statistical interpretation of the experimental design. Given that I did not have IRB approval for the study from my home institution, I took care not to analyze any primary data — the datafiles that I analyzed were the same replication datasets that Michael LaCour posted to his website.&nbsp; Looking back, the failure to verify the original Qualtrics data was a serious mistake.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The study and its fallout prompted him to make changes in his collaborations. “My data-related collaborations now involve teams of people (rather than single individuals) working on data collection and data analysis,” Green said last month by email. “Research materials are shared and date-stamped.&nbsp; Replication materials work from basic inputs to final outputs.” And, he added, he no longer supervises doctoral students from other schools.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trust but verify</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">A year after the LaCour retraction, Broockman and Kalla <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad9713?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D47784030037439004724201340512953342440%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1749223486">published a study</a> finding that 10-minute, in-person conversations between door-to-door canvassers and voters in South Florida could “substantially reduce transphobia” and that the gender identity of the canvasser didn’t matter. (The irony of the finding’s similarity to LaCour’s, and its publication in <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/no-wait-short-conversations-really-can-reduce-prejudice/477105/">wasn’t</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/political-sciences-whistleblowers-rebunk-gay-canvassing-study/">lost on</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/real-time-talking-people-about-gay-and-transgender-issues-can-change-their-prejudices">the media</a> either.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, they’ve conducted “at least nine or 10 replications in various forms related to different issues,” from work on transphobia to immigration rights, Kalla said. “This style of non judgmentally exchanging narratives through door-to-door canvassing can durably reduce people&#8217;s prejudicial views towards these various out groups.”</p>



<p>Most recently, they <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/7xbza_v1">posted a preprint</a> of a study on how endorsements and special interest groups affect voter behavior in primaries and general elections. By surveying 31,000 respondents during 2024 elections in 27 congressional districts, they found “primary voters actually struggle to identify which candidates match their views. So they rely on other cues—especially from interest groups who might help drive polarization,” Broockman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dbroockman.bsky.social/post/3lq5uelcvqs2v">posted on Bluesky</a>.</p>



<p>Just as they’ve stayed on theme with their research, so too have their opinions on the infrastructure for research. Shortly after the LaCour retraction, Broockman and Kalla <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/22/9009927/lacour-gay-homophobia-study">wrote an editorial</a> in <em>Vox </em>reacting to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/science/retractions-scientific-studies.html">coverage</a> citing “a growing number” of retractions. They cautioned retractions were a sign that the system is strong, not weak. They wrote at the time:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The fact that we are especially likely to see and hear about the errors scientists make does not suggest scientists are especially prone to making mistakes. Rather, it shows that scientific errors are increasingly likely to be detected and corrected instead of being swept under the rug.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Has that view changed? “When scandals like this MIT thing this week come out, those should make people more confident in academic research, because they show there is an ecosystem to catch this stuff,” Broockman said in our recent interview. “I think we should be wary of proposals to over-regulate academic research, to solve for these rare events.”</p>



<p>He continued: &#8220;But if we&#8217;re going to not over-regulate the doing of the research, that means we need the fire alarm — and that&#8217;s what you guys [Retraction Watch] are — and we need the researchers doing the research knowing that there&#8217;s a reasonable chance they will get caught.&#8221;</p>



<p>He likened blatant fraud cases like LaCour’s to “the airplane crashes of academic research” — they get a lot of attention, but in terms of what&nbsp; affects more people, “they attract far disproportionate attention,” he said. “If I were making a top five list of ways academia is not producing research that is as truthful as it could be, I don’t think fraud would be in my top five.” Issues like p-hacking, selectively including data, and deviating from research plans are all smaller infractions that are bigger issues, he said.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-green-3-by-john-pinderhughes_cropped.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="410" height="498" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-green-3-by-john-pinderhughes_cropped.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132080" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-green-3-by-john-pinderhughes_cropped.jpg 410w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/donald-green-3-by-john-pinderhughes_cropped-247x300.jpg 247w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Donald Green</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Carelessness has a large effect in the literature, too. “For me, the biggest takeaway is, sure, fraud happens,” Kalla said. “I think the bigger concern in research is sloppiness.” He and Broockman are systematic in their collaborations, carefully checking each other’s code and work. “And I think that extends to collaborations with other people as well. The trust-but-verify mentality,” Kalla said, “and definitely not in a skeptical, hostile, fraud based way. It&#8217;s very easy to make mistakes.”</p>



<p><a href="https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/donald-p-green">Green</a> also continues to study U.S. public opinion and political behavior, branching out to study the influence of mass media in low- and middle-income countries. “Several of my field experiments since then have focused on how narrative entertainment shapes beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions,” he said. Those include studies on how a Tanzanian radio drama <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140221139385">influenced attitudes on early and forced marriage</a>, and the influence of a media campaign on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414020912275">violence against women in Uganda</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Coda</h3>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Ten years on, Green, Broockman and Kalla say the study and its demise still come up periodically, but far less often than it did in the year or two immediately after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My sense is that this episode is discussed fairly widely when scholars and instructors assess the replication crisis in social science, in part because the case illustrates both why research might fail to replicate (in this instance, due to fraud) as well as the norms and institutions that have emerged to expose replication failures (such as the availability of replication data that in this case exposed how fabricated data were grafted onto an existing dataset),” Green said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He talks about it indirectly in his undergraduate textbook, but “students seem to be less and less familiar with the episode as time passes,” he said. “I suppose that a senior now would have been in elementary school when it happened.”</p>



<p>Every once in a while a student will ask Kalla about the case, he said, and Broockman said it mostly comes up when he’s talking to researchers in other disciplines, but not so much anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Broockman, the story has an added personal note: Eight years ago, it came up on a first date — with the man he’s now engaged to. “He had listened to the ‘<a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/584/transcript">This American Life’ episode</a> about all of this,” he said. “So maybe that served me well.”</p>

<p><em>PLOS One</em> has retracted a 2011 paper first flagged for image issues 11 years ago. The retraction marks the fourth for the paper’s lead author, Gabriella Marfè of the University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli,” in Caserta, Italy. </p>



<p>“<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027313">Involvement of FOXO Transcription Factors, TRAIL-FasL/Fas, and Sirtuin Proteins Family in Canine Coronavirus Type II-Induced Apoptosis</a>,” has been cited 41 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elisabeth Bik <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/966107DE4652202AFB4D18055459F8">flagged the article on PubPeer</a> in 2014 for apparent image manipulation and duplication in six figures. In a 2019 email to PLOS staff, pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis drew attention to Bik’s findings. The journal retracted the paper on May 6 of this year.</p>



<span id="more-132053"></span>



<p>In response to questions on why the retraction took so long, David Knutson, PLOS’s head of communications, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our Publication Ethics team became aware of this case in 2019; We initially contacted the authors in 2019 to request their input on the concerns, but due to resourcing issues and competing priorities the case was then inactive until November 2024. <br><br>Based on information we received from an external source, PLOS may have discussed the case with the authors several years prior, but if so that correspondence was purged, lost, or archived prior to 2018 when our Publication Ethics team formed and centralized all ethics case records.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The retraction notice called out issues with eight figures that include “discontinuities” and “similarities” in multiple images, as well as one figure “that appears similar” to work <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/107/9/3683/133494/Growth-inhibition-and-apoptosis-in-human">reported in <em>Blood</em></a> in 2006 by a different group of authors. “The authors’ responses did not resolve the concerns with this article,” the notice stated, and the authors did not respond to the decision to retract the article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marfè was a coauthor on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cas.16390">a 2010 paper</a> retracted in October for “several instances of duplications of western blot bands” and “splicing and deletion of bands.” That paper, in the journal <em>Cancer Science</em>, had also been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A2445FE509AA3D92C6EC3ED2B1D980#">flagged on Pubpeer</a> in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two additional retractions — a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.24572">2009 <em>International Journal of Cancer</em> paper</a> retracted in 2019, and <a href="https://bmcphysiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6793-10-7">a 2010 article in <em>BMC Physiology</em></a><em> </em>retracted in 2014 — included some of the same authors as the article in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2014/01/14/out-of-the-running-dodgy-blots-prompt-retraction-of-paper-on-marathoning-and-cell-death/">We wrote about the latter retraction</a> at the time.</p>



<p>Marfè did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The Center for Scientific Integrity, the parent nonprofit of Retraction Watch, has launched a new initiative to investigate and rapidly disseminate problems in the medical literature that directly affect human health.</p>



<p>Thanks to a $900,000 grant from <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/">Open Philanthropy</a>, the <a href="https://medicalevidenceproject.org/">Medical Evidence Project</a> will leverage the tools of forensic metascience — using visual and computational methods to determine a paper’s trustworthiness — to rapidly identify problems in scientific articles, combined with the experience and platform of Retraction Watch to disseminate those findings.</p>



<p>“We originally set up <a href="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://centerforscientificintegrity.org/">The Center for Scientific Integrity</a> as a home for Retraction Watch, but we always hoped we would be able to do more in the research accountability space,” said Ivan Oransky, executive director of the Center and cofounder of Retraction Watch. “The Medical Evidence Project allows us to support critical analysis and disseminate the findings.”</p>



<span id="more-132018"></span>



<p>Several high-profile cases illustrate the need to scrutinize the medical literature. For example, European guidelines for giving beta blockers to patients before major surgery were based on results from a set of clinical trials, the DECREASE trials,<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g5210"> later discredited due to misconduct</a>. Dozens of systematic reviews and clinical guidelines on treatments for osteoporosis included clinical trials by Japanese bone-health researcher Yoshihiro Sato, who, it turned out,<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/researcher-center-epic-fraud-remains-enigma-those-who-exposed-him"> fabricated clinical trial results</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond these high-profile cases are papers with what might appear to be small errors or mistakes that have an outsized impact on clinical results. The Medical Evidence Project aims to take a systematic look at these articles.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heathers_James_square.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="501" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heathers_James_square.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132050" style="width:250px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heathers_James_square.jpg 500w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heathers_James_square-300x300.jpg 300w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heathers_James_square-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Heathers</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Scientific sleuth James Heathers will serve as the project’s director. “When we publish papers or change policies, we often get estimates of how many people would be positively affected by changes in treatment guidelines,” Heathers said. “I would like to produce that same estimate for the <em>re-evaluation</em> of the existing evidence. I strongly suspect that we&#8217;re about to do something seriously cost-effective, but I&#8217;ll only sleep well when I&#8217;ve proved it.”</p>



<p>Grantmaking organization<a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/"> Open Philanthropy</a> has generously funded the Medical Evidence Project for $450,000 per year for two years. Staff for the project will also include part-time analysts and an editor to do investigations and write and publish results.</p>



<p>Investigations by universities, organizations and publishers often take months or years to complete, and findings are only communicated at the end of the process. The Medical Evidence Project hopes to accelerate that, swiftly disseminating the results of its investigations.</p>



<p>The project will take a broad look at all disciplines of medicine, Heathers said.</p>



<p>“There have been some unpleasant and relevant cases in anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, surgery, trauma, and different elements of alternative and complementary medicine over the last few years,” he said. “I&#8217;d like to see if there are any more. But I&#8217;m quite agnostic. There isn&#8217;t much &#8216;patient-neutral&#8217; medicine. It all matters.”</p>

<p>For years, sleuths – whose names our readers are <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">likely familiar with</a> – have been diligently flagging issues with the scientific literature. More than a dozen of these specialists have teamed up to create a set of guides to teach others their trade.</p>



<p>The Collection of Open Science Integrity Guides (COSIG) aims to make “post-publication peer review” more accessible, according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15564777">preprint</a> made available online today. The 25 guides so far range from general – “PubPeer commenting best practices” – to field-specific – like spotting issues with X-ray diffraction patterns.</p>



<p>Although 15 sleuths are named as contributors on the project, those we talked to emphasized the project should be largely credited to Reese Richardson, the author of the preprint.</p>



<span id="more-132027"></span>



<p><a href="https://reeserichardson.blog/">Richardson</a>, a metascience researcher at Northwestern University, told us the motivation behind the project was to “affirm that <em>anyone</em> can do post-publication peer review, especially working scientists.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We wanted to demonstrate how far just a few tidbits of specialized knowledge — like how to check energy dispersive X-ray spectra, what to look for in cases of suspected plagiarism and what softwares are available for image forensics — can go towards spotting integrity issues in the scientific literature,” Richardson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jennifer Byrne, who contributed to the biology and medicine sections, told us she thought the guides would be most helpful for early-career researchers. They are “often the people who are closest to the literature and they&#8217;re also people that might be not aware of these issues already,” she said.</p>



<p>“I tend to think that most people will start within their own fields because they will apply these guides to research they&#8217;re already reading,” Byrne, a molecular oncology professor at the University of Sydney, added.<br><br>People might use the guides differently depending on whether their focus is experimental or theoretical science. In the experimental sciences, spotting issues in the literature could cut back on unnecessary follow-up studies. Reproducing an experiment could take “weeks or months” of work, she said. “Reading one of the guides could stop someone from doing that because they realize before they start that the experiment wasn&#8217;t done correctly,” she said.</p>



<p>For theoretical papers, plagiarism is one of the most prominent issues, Byrne told us. The general guides, like “Citations and “Formulaic research,” might be more helpful in these cases, she said.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Many of the sleuths we spoke with shared concerns about making the guides public, but maintained the outcome of COSIG will ultimately be positive.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Elisabeth Bik told us the team initially worried providing the “red flags” of paper mills was “basically revealing how we detect them. If we&#8217;re telling them what we&#8217;re paying attention to, in a way, we&#8217;re telling them how to fraud better,” she said. (A note that Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/13/elisabeth-bik-science-integrity-fund-einstein-award/">administers</a> the Elisabeth Bik Science Integrity Fund.)</p>



<p>However, Bik also noted the information is already available in PubPeer comments, and the purpose of the guide was to centralize the information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anna Abalkina, research fellow at Freie Universität Berlin in Germany and creator of the Retraction Watch <a href="https://retractionwatch.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4f35c1f2e9acc58eee0811e78&amp;id=a3ced19cd8&amp;e=c820270347">Hijacked Journal Checker</a>, called&nbsp; the current situation with both paper mills and scientific fraud “critical.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The number of activists reviewing problematic papers is far too small given the overall scale of the issue,” Abalkina said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Byrne said journals aren’t responding to issues with papers even now, so “the risk is that the backlog will just get more acute.”</p>



<p>Richardson said he plans to add more guides and that he and his colleagues hope COSIG will be “a constantly-expanding resource.” The list of contributors includes three “Maintainers” who will “review and edit contributions, seek feedback on contributions/guides from other members of the community and from subject-matter experts and manage official updates to COSIG,” he said.</p>



<p>Solal Pirelli, a maintainer and former Ph.D. student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, told us his role is to “help newcomers contribute productively, even if they aren&#8217;t sure of exactly what to say, or if they don&#8217;t have expertise in the specific tooling we use.”</p>



<p>Byrne says she foresees a guide on generative AI being added, among other topics researchers and future sleuths might find useful.</p>



<p>Brandon Stell, the president of PubPeer, said an organizer was involved in initial discussions around the guides. The first guide in the collection is devoted to best practices for PubPeer commenting. </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As for what contributors hoped might come out of the guides, Bik told us she hopes they will bring a “sense of professionalism” to the art of sleuthing. Sleuths “don&#8217;t have magic eyes or come up with random things we see. We have documents on how we do it, we can learn from each other and we can make those documents better,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In discussions about breaches of scientific integrity, “there is always concern that we are only giving ammunition to the anti-science crowd,” Richardson said. That concern is especially relevant with the current U.S. administration, which is “trying to redefine what constitutes scientific misconduct and what constitutes ’<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/restoring-gold-standard-science/">gold standard science</a>’ to meet their specific policy goals,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now is the time to double down on making the scientific enterprise better and commit to doing good science – and good peer review thereof – out in the open,” he said. “We want to arm scientists with the tools to uphold the integrity of the literature, precisely so that the anti-science crowd isn&#8217;t allowed to redefine science integrity on their terms.”</p>

                <p>After 15 happy years on WordPress.com, I&#8217;ve moved to Substack at <a href="https://neuroai.science">neuroai.science</a>. I&#8217;ve already published more than a dozen long-form articles on neuroscience and AI over there in newsletter format. You can subscribe or read the archives completely free. </p>



<p>Substack makes it easy to create sticky experiences for audiences and reach them where they are–in their email. This is all the more important as traditional social media channels have de-emphasized link sharing, making it harder to maintain an audience. The archives of xcorr.net will remain here. Thank you for supporting the blog over its long run!</p>

                A group of neuroscientists and philosophers discuss the use and misuse of the term "representation" across the cognitive sciences and how it influences the way we interpret the connection between neural, behavioral and mental activity.

                The interpeduncular nucleus produces an aversion to nicotine, even at low doses, and helps moderate how rewarding mice find the drug.
