<p><em>Retraction Watch readers may recall the story of Paolo Macchiarini, about whom <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2012/11/26/misconduct-leads-to-retraction-from-italian-super-surgeon-under-house-arrest/">we first wrote in 2012</a> before he became the subject of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/11/29/bad-surgeon-dr-paolo-macchiarini-documentary/71720685007/">international scrutiny</a> &#8212; and who has <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/sweden-says-windpipe-surgeon-can-serve-prison-term-in-spain-6d3f577f">now been sentenced to prison</a>. We are pleased to present an excerpt about the Macchiarini case from&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Thinking+about+Science%3A+Good+Science%2C+Bad+Science%2C+and+How+to+Make+It+Better-p-9781683674344"></a><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324065500">The Occasional Human Sacrifice: Medical Experimentation and the Price of Saying No</a><em>&nbsp;by Carl Elliott published by W. W. Norton, May 2024.</em></p>



<p>One incident illustrates just how determined the leaders of the Karolinska Institute were to protect Paolo Macchiarini. In November of 2014, a leaked copy of the whistleblowers’ report came into the hands of the New York Times, which published an article titled “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/world/leading-surgeon-is-accused-of-misconduct-in-experimental-transplant-operations.html">Leading Surgeon Is Accused of Misconduct in Experimental Transplant Operations</a>.” The article detailed several of the most serious allegations against Macchiarini: that he had never obtained ethical permission to conduct his experiments, that his <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61715-7/fulltext">2011 study in The Lancet</a> had misrepresented the outcome of Beyene’s implant, and that of the three patients at the Karolinska Institute that Macchiarini had given synthetic implants, only Beyene had signed a consent form— and the form was dated two weeks after his surgery. The publicity generated by the article all but forced the Karolinska Institute to act. Anders Hamsten, the vice-chancellor, said he would ask for an external inquiry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retaliation against the whistleblowers came quickly. According to Simonson, the whistleblowers were told that they had violated patient privacy and would be fired immediately. That didn’t happen, but in December the Karolinska Institute informed the whistleblowers that the head of the cardiothoracic clinic would deliver a formal warning, the last step before an employee is terminated.</p>



<p>The Karolinska Institute also reported the whistleblowers to the police. “I was called down to the police and put in a room with no windows, with a tape recorder and a lawyer and a policeman in front of me, and interrogated. That was pretty scary,” Matthias Corbascio, a cardiothoracic surgeons says. “It was exactly what it’s like on television. And you know, it’s hard to be a tough guy in that room.”&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129207"></span>



<p>The accusations were baseless; the whistleblowers had anonymized all the identities in their report, and Corbascio had applied in advance for ethical permission to access patient records. “I wrote that ethics application because I knew that they were going to try to fire us,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the spring of 2015, the external inquiry Hamsten had promised was completed. Dr. Bengt Gerdin, an emeritus professor at Uppsala University Hospital, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/05/28/misconduct-found-in-7-papers-by-macchiarini-says-english-write-up-of-investigation/">concluded</a> that Macchiarini was guilty of scientific misconduct. The inquiry didn’t address any potential abuses of human subjects, but the result of the inquiry was clear. Macchiarini had falsified his research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even an external corroboration of misconduct didn’t deter the Karolinska Institute leaders. It took months for them to respond, and when they finally came to a conclusion, they called a press conference. “We asked if we could attend the press conference, and they said no,” Simonson says. “They then called our boss at the time and said that they were hiring guards to stop us from attending.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accompanied by members of the Nobel Committee, Hamsten disavowed Gerdin’s external inquiry and proclaimed his confidence in Macchiarini. The whistleblowers were stunned. Macchiarini responded with gratitude. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/science/paolo-macchiarini-researcher-cleared-of-scientific-misconduct-charges.html">To have been falsely accused of such serious misconduct is every researcher’s nightmare</a>,” he said. The Lancet applauded the decision with an editorial titled “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00118-X/fulltext">Paolo Macchiarini Is Not Guilty of Scientific Misconduct</a>.”</p>



<p>Grinnemo remembers this entire period as a very dark time. The stress was overwhelming. “I mean, I couldn’t sleep. I was always thinking of this next strategic move,” he says. People he considered friends stopped returning his calls and emails. He could not concentrate on his research. He found it hard to give his children the attention they needed. “It was also hard doing surgery, to be standing there focusing on the operation,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thought that he might have sacrificed his career for a futile cause sent him into a panic. Corbascio felt the same way. The hostility at work was palpable. He says, “I think that Kalle and I were like the two most hated people at Karolinska, and I’ve no doubt about that.”</p>

<p>In the late afternoon at a conference in Cartagena last year, a team of Swedish researchers <a href="https://www5.shocklogic.com/client_data/ccsa/uploads/2023%20ISPRM/001_Programa%20ISPRM%202023%20Sin%20Time%20Table_compressed.pdf">presented their work</a> on a technique that uses machine learning to translate the body&#8217;s own electric signals used to move a limb. They had tested it on a minor recovering from a stroke.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/C-2024-0495-EOK-rapport.pdf">Documents from an internal investigation</a> shared by Chalmers University have now revealed, however, that this case study was part of a series of regulatory lapses and suspicious research practices at the Centre for Bionics and Pain Research (CBPR) where the clinical research was conducted. The researchers seem to have conducted the study before Max Ortiz-Catalán, the center’s founder and former manager, had secured regulatory approval from the relevant Swedish agency. </p>



<p>Chalmers, the Centre’s home, has now <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/research-at-the-centre-for-bionics-and-pain-research-is-suspended-and-deficiencies-are-reported-to-regulatory-authorities/">suspended it</a> after also suspecting that its data and research participants seemed “systematically selected” so that treatments appeared effective, and excluded data when treatments caused health problems. The investigation also uncovered the center had no person responsible for compliance, which is a <a href="https://www.lakemedelsverket.se/sv/medicinteknik/tillverka/person-med-ansvar-for-att-regelverket-efterlevs#hmainbody1">requirement under Swedish law</a>, and that personal data had been handled poorly. </p>



<span id="more-129236"></span>



<p class="has-drop-cap">This isn’t the first time CBPR has come under scrutiny for questionable research practices. Two years ago, a divided committee absolved several of its researchers from charges of misconduct after a local newspaper pointed out serious omissions in a published paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2022, <em>Forskning &amp; Framsteg</em> <a href="https://fof.se/artikel/har-ar-armen-forskarna-ville-glomma/#klarna:486a61ba-fd4c-5fac-91c5-65c3478bda93">reported that researchers</a> affiliated with CBPR, again including Ortiz-Catalán, had excluded the life-threatening complications — such as sepsis and infection — experienced by a patient who had received a prosthetic arm. The paper, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1917537?query=featured_home">‘Self-Contained Neuromusculoskeletal Arm Prostheses’</a> published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, had <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/30/mind-controlled-prosthetic-arm-patients-feel-objects/">generated buzz</a> for its advances in ‘mind-controlled’ prosthetic limbs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CBPR had conducted the research in collaboration with Swedish prosthetics company, Integrum. When the deficiencies in the paper were first reported, Integrum CEO Rickard Brånemark said the omissions were “regrettable” and that the authors’ intention was not to hide information, since the complications had been reported at conferences. A month later, in October 2022, the authors published a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMx220013">lengthy correction</a> explaining the patient’s adverse events.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">But when the correction was published, an investigation into alleged falsification was still underway. Chalmers University had submitted a case to Sweden’s national board for research misconduct one day after the newspaper’s report, followed by the University of Gothenburg submitting the same suspicions to the board a month later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors argued that the patient who experienced the life-threatening complications had received a different kind of prosthetic arm, and that they had intended to publish the medical complications in a subsequent paper, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Decision-in-case-3.1-22-0118_0137_web.pdf">according to the board&#8217;s decision</a> published in June 2023. The authors also claim the Journal’s editor wanted the patient to be included, despite the team’s initial plan to exclude them from the paper because of issues with follow-up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The board found the authors not guilty of research misconduct, though three members dissented, writing:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When the article was ready for publication, the authors knew about the complications that affected Patient 4. However, the reasons why Patient 4, who is mentioned in several places in the article, was excluded are not made clear and the context in which complications arose is not knowable either…</p>



<p>We consider it was gross negligence not to report the complications that arose in one of the few research participants included in the study described in the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ortiz-Catalán left CBPR while an internal investigation was being carried out due to “issues in his leadership,” media relations manager Henrik Dahlberg wrote in an email to Retraction Watch. “I won’t go into any detail here,” he added. Ortiz-Catalán has since moved to Australia, where he works at the Bionics Institute in Melbourne.&nbsp; He has not responded to several requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">New information about operational issues at CBPR came from a staff tip-off in March 2024, prompting the latest internal investigation at Chalmers that has resulted in the center’s suspension. “The ethics committee decided that they needed to investigate, since what had been revealed indicated irregularities in the research that had been carried out at CBPR,” Dahlberg wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The investigators examined 50 publications that were published between 2020 and 2024 which include Ortiz-Catalán as an author. They found a large number of ethical permits, but only one regulatory permit since the CBPR was formed — dated several weeks after researchers had presented their clinical case study at the conference in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also noted a lack of legal agreement between Integrum, the company that collaborated in the 2020 study, and Chalmers University.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is our assessment that the activities at CBPR violate the law regarding regulatory permits.” the investigators wrote, noting that this carries a maximum imprisonment of two years according to Swedish law. “In addition, there is a suspicion that they do not comply with the European regulations for medical devices and do not live up to the Declaration of Helsinki,” the report continues. The investigators also found issues with security in the management of personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While the investigation focused on whether permits were in place for the work, the report suggests that data was selected to appear favorable to the treatments. Chalmers and the other collaborating institutions — the University of Gothenburg and Sahlgrenska University Hospital — agreed to suspend CBPR’s operations and have asked Swedish research authorities to review work from the group dating back to 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to questions about whether this affects research produced collaboratively between Integrum and CBPR, Integrum CEO Rickard Brånemark wrote:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The NEJM article you refer to has already been thoroughly re-examined, after which a correction was published on November 1, 2022. Moreover, an academic research evaluation confirmed that no misconduct had been committed. I feel confident that everything in that paper is correct and balanced. To my current knowledge, there are no reasons to correct or retract any of the other articles I have co-authored with researchers at CBPR. Should the evaluation following the closure of CBPR find any inconsistencies in any publication, we will of course make sure to correct these.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> ResearchGate published the following press release on May 16th, 2024.<br><br><strong>Berlin (Germany) and San Francisco (USA) May 16, 2024 </strong>&ndash; ResearchGate, the professional network for researchers, and PLOS, a leading nonprofit Open Access publisher, are pleased to announce a new partnership that will enhance the visibility and reach of PLOS&rsquo; journals through ResearchGate&rsquo;s innovative <em>Journal Home</em> offering.</p>



<p>PLOS publishes rigorously peer-reviewed research articles together with expert commentary and analysis. All articles are open access meaning the science published can be shared with the widest possible audience ensuring everyone can access, share and reuse the high-quality content. More than 300,000 PLOS articles will now be accessible on ResearchGate, growing engagement with ResearchGate&rsquo;s 25m+ active researcher members &ndash;&nbsp;this includes previously published articles from all their journals, as well as newly published articles being made available as they are published.</p>



<p><em>Journal Home</em> ensures that all PLOS journal content will be visible and accessible throughout the ResearchGate platform and across all relevant touchpoints for members. Dedicated Journal Profiles will provide key information and content from journals, as well as uniquely enable ResearchGate members to explore directly how their own community is connected to a journal.</p>



<p>PLOS authors will have their articles automatically added to their ResearchGate profiles, making it easy for them to share their work and discover more about who is reading and citing it. They will benefit from enhanced opportunities to connect with their communities as their work will now be directly discoverable, accessible and shareable through ResearchGate.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This partnership supports our mission at PLOS to empower and connect researchers across demographics, geographies and disciplines,&rdquo; said Niamh O&rsquo;Connor, Chief Publishing Officer, PLOS. &ldquo;ResearchGate provides us with a new way to open up our journals and published articles and to enable greater connections across our communities.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to be working with one of the vanguards of open science,&rdquo; said S&ouml;ren Hofmayer, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at ResearchGate. &ldquo;PLOS has established an enviable reputation in the industry as an organisation that is transforming research communication. We&rsquo;re committed to helping PLOS learn more about its community through <em>Journal Home</em>&rsquo;s unique network insights.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This coming <strong>Wednesday, May 22, 2024</strong>, the arXiv editorial staff will be attending a team development retreat. Because all editorial staff will be participating in this professional development, it will temporarily affect arXiv’s mailings, help desk, and announcement schedule. This brief change will only affect the announcement of new submissions; arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation, existing papers will still be available to browse, and arXiv will be accepting new submissions during this time.</p>
<p>The arXiv team primarily takes time off according to the holiday schedule of the United States. In the coming months, there are a few US federal holidays that will cause some disruption to arXiv’s regular announcements, mailings, and user support.</p>
<p>Submissions to arXiv are typically made public on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">announced by email</a> on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/availability">regular schedule</a>. As you plan your submissions to arXiv in the coming weeks and months, please be aware of the delays around the following dates. Mailings and public availability of new submissions will be deferred accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wednesday, May 22, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Tuesday, May 21, 2024, and before 14:00ET Thursday May 23, 2024 will be announced on Thursday, May 23, 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, Jun 19, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Tuesday, June 18, 2024, and before 14:00ET Thursday June 20, 2024 will be announced on Thursday, June 20, 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday, July 4, 2024.</strong> No announcement or help desk support. Articles received and accepted at or after 14:00ET Wednesday, July 3, 2024, and before 14:00ET Friday July 5, 2024 will be announced on Sunday, July 7, 2024.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2019, Filippo Berto <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning/flest-innvandrere-pa-publiseringstoppen-blant-norske-forskere/119288">was hailed</a> as Norway’s most productive researcher, publishing a new study on average every two to three days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years on, a committee appointed by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), where Berto, a mechanical engineer, was based until last year, is recommending that the institution carries out an in-depth investigation into his work following a complaint by Per Steineide Refseth, a librarian at the Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences in Rena.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rune Nydal, a philosopher at NTNU who leads the independent research integrity committee that met May 14 partly to discuss the complaint about Berto’s work, told <em>Retraction Watch </em>it is recommending NTNU’s rector conduct an in-depth probe into Berto’s papers and release a public statement on the outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-129227"></span>



<p>The recommendation was first <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/fakultet-for-ingeniorvitenskap-filippo-berto-forskningsetikk/anbefaler-uavhengig-granskning-av-varsler-mot-filippo-berto/406642">reported yesterday by NTNU&#8217;s student newspaper</a>.</p>



<p>Berto is accused of <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/196F5E84F5104AF5B15DE5CA0D22C6">publishing duplicate studies</a> in multiple journals, including <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A6354397676E94CAB9658CAB57D139">references to irrelevant studies</a>, and producing articles that contain keywords from advertisements from <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/20/revealed-the-inner-workings-of-a-paper-mill/">paper mills</a>, which sell authorships and citations on bogus or subpar studies in exchange for a fee. By our count, Berto, who has <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning/flest-innvandrere-pa-publiseringstoppen-blant-norske-forskere/119288">reportedly expressed</a> aspirations to become Europe’s most productive researcher, has at least five retractions to his name. </p>



<p>While the NTNU cannot sanction Berto since he no longer works there, Nydal noted that “any statement from the university is also a sanction.” He added that, “it’s in the institution’s interest in clarifying what happened and what the extent of [the problem] is.”</p>



<p>In September 2023, Berto moved to the Sapienza University of Rome in Italy. <em>Retraction Watch</em> has approached Sapienza and Berto for comments. &nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap"><a href="https://bibliotek.usn.no/publication-points/category26628.html">A policy in Norway</a> now under review allows institutions in the country to benefit financially from the Ministry of Education and Research for every paper produced by their faculty and staff. <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning/flest-innvandrere-pa-publiseringstoppen-blant-norske-forskere/119288">According to NTNU’s student paper</a>, in 2022, an average academic at Norwegian institutions accumulated 1.25 publication points. By comparison, between 2019 and 2022, <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/filippo-berto-forskningsetikk-forskningsjuks/norges-mestpubliserende-forsker-granskes-for-alvorlige-brudd-pa-etiske-normer/403870">Berto earned</a> 407.08 publication points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will be up to the NTNU rector whether the institution will return the money the institution has received from the ministry directly as a result of Berto’s papers, Nydal said, adding that the amount is a significant sum. “It’s a more serious case here than the question of the money,” he said. “It’s a matter of [alleged] misuse of the publication system.”</p>



<p>“Researchers are evaluated too much based on how much they have published instead of the quality of what they have published, and that the Norwegian publication points system may have contributed to this,” Refseth, who has <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/03/29/norway-demotes-hindawi-journals-after-claims-one-published-a-stolen-paper/">been involved in other research integrity efforts</a> in the past, told us. “I support changing the system of publication-based funding in Norway.”</p>



<p>But Nydal said academia has enough incentives for researchers to continuously churn out papers even without the policy being in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Refseth’s complaint only flagged 17 or 18 studies, Berto authored hundreds more papers during his stint at NTNU. According to Google Scholar, Berto published 871 studies between the 2018 and 2023 calendar years. </p>



<p>“It certainly doesn’t look good,” Nydal said. “It’s an enormous amount of papers.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">To date, Berto has <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Filippo+Berto">28 papers flagged on PubPeer</a>, 11 of which were added within the last month. Many of the comments on the site are from Angus Wilkinson, a materials scientist at the University of Oxford, in England, who said he came across a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A6354397676E94CAB9658CAB57D139">March 2023 PubPeer post</a> by scientific sleuth <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/25/meet-a-sleuth-whose-work-has-resulted-in-more-than-850-retractions/">Nick Wise</a>, a fluid dynamics researcher at the University of Cambridge, in England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that post, Wise noted that the paper in question contains keywords from a Telegram advert offering to sell citations. “I’ve looked through the introduction section of this paper and suggest that ~65% of the papers cited are inappropriate for the subject area of the text,” wrote Wilkinson, whose area of expertise is the same as Berto, in response to Wise on PubPeer in November 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That 2022 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167844222003172">paper</a>, “Effects of tensile overload on fatigue crack growth in AM60 magnesium alloys,” has since been retracted by <em>Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics. </em>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167844222003172">retraction notice</a> issued in December 2022 reads:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor in Chief.</p>

<p>The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As a consequence, Berto no longer serves on the editorial board of <em>Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics</em>. According to <a href="https://www.universitetsavisa.no/filippo-berto-forskningsetikk-forskningsjuks/norges-mestpubliserende-forsker-granskes-for-alvorlige-brudd-pa-etiske-normer/403870">NTNU’s student newspaper</a>, Berto has also been removed from the editorial boards of <em>the International Journal of Fatigue </em>and <em>Engineering Failure Analysis</em>, which have also retracted papers by him, for similar reasons.</p>



<p><em>Engineering Failure Analysis </em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350630721003174">retracted a 2021 study</a>, “An investigation on fatigue behavior of AA2024 aluminum alloy sheets in fuselage lap joints,” by Berto and colleagues for “duplication of text and methodology, as well as salami slicing of research results.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile <em>The International Journal of Fatigue</em> has also retracted a 2021 study by Berto and colleagues, titled “Reliability analysis of fatigue crack growth for rail steel under variable amplitude service loading conditions and wear.” According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142112321003091">retraction note</a>, issued in November 2021, the paper duplicates “significant parts” of another already published study.</p>



<p><em>Fatigue &amp; Fracture of Engineering Materials &amp; Structures</em> has retracted the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ffe.12616">2017 study</a>, “Fracture investigation of U-notch made of tungsten–copper functionally graded materials by means of strain energy density.” Its <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ffe.13692">retraction note</a> says that the paper was pulled in agreement with the authors because it has “considerable overlap with a previously published article.”</p>



<p>Berto and colleagues also retracted <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/564816363/10-1007-s11223-017-9884-2">a study</a>, “Fatigue Assessment of Ti-6Al-4V Circular Notched Specimens Produced by Selective Laser Melting,” published by <em>Strength of Materials</em>, noting in <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/01D9EC6D8EE20A2A30E6A3BD072791">the retraction notice</a> that the paper has already been published elsewhere.</p>

<p>The study of skeletal development in mammalian species is difficult due to the technical and ethical challenges of collecting embryonic material. Fortunately, natural history museums contain broad collections that often include prenatal specimens.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors took advantage of one such museum collection to study ossification (bone formation) in 15 specimens from six species of mammalian carnivores: sea lion, mongoose, lion, fox, bear, and civet. They used micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to non-invasively evaluate the extent of bone formation in each specimen and were able to determine the order of ossification in these species.</p>
<p>The authors found that most of the species conformed to known ossification sequences of either canine or feline clades of carnivores, but that the sequence for sea lions diverged. They suggest that sea lion&#8217;s aquatic environment has affected prenatal development to differ from land mammals&#8217;.</p>

<p>Prediction of future COVID-19 waves is crucial to support decision-making regarding vaccine allocation and public health policy. However, many of the models used do not take into account effects of both vaccination and prior infections.</p>
<p>To address these shortcomings, the authors of this paper created predictive models that consider how combinations of vaccination and prior Omicron infection will protect populations from near-future outbreaks of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. They also considered population age demographics and the context of public health measures to reduce infection (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>They found that a variety of factors, including demography, health systems capacity, and vaccine efficacy, had critical effects on the benefits of vaccination and past infection in outbreak prevention. Understanding the interplay between these factors will be useful for tailoring outbreak prevention efforts.</p>

Laws on assisted dying vary around the world, and devising a new law for the UK is a complex matter. Issues to be considered include patient autonomy and protection of the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Twycross presents three different models of assisted dying legal in different countries with different requirements for patient eligibility. He then presents a &#8216;least worse&#8217; model with minimal physician involvement. Importantly, palliative-hospice care should not be involved, as some patient may decline to use such care for fear of overuse of drugs.</p>

<p>Prolonged sitting is known to be associated with numerous negative health outcomes, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Coffee, on the other hand, has been shown to be associated with reduced mortality. How these two common factors interact and balance is not known.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors studied the joint associations of daily sitting time and coffee intake with mortality from all-cause and CVD in nationally representative sample from the United States of America. Data on daily sitting time and coffee consumption for over ten thousand adults were included.</p>
<p>As expected, the authors found that longer sitting time and higher coffee consumption had opposite associations with mortality. Interestingly, the joint analysis showed that the association between higher sitting time and increased mortality was only present among adults who didn&#8217;t drink coffee, indicating a possible protective effect of coffee consumption.</p>

<p>Male partner involvement in antenatal care (ANC) is known to improve maternal outcomes as well as provide opportunities for HIV testing and counselling for men who might not otherwise have healthcare system contact. Generally, pregnant women invite their partners to attend ANC and HIV testing, but uptake is low.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors report the results of a randomized controlled trial that used a mobile phone intervention and clinic staff invitations to partners of women who attended ANC alone. Outcomes included male partner attendance at later ANC visits and utilization of HIV testing of male partners after the invitation.</p>
<p>The results showed that mobile phone invitations from clinic staff had a positive effect on both male partner ANC attendance and male partner HIV testing. This is a promising strategy to enhance male partner involvement in maternal care and improve health outcomes.</p>

<p>A group of researchers is taking <em>Nature </em>to task for publishing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w">paper</a> earlier this month about Google DeepMind’s protein folding prediction program without requiring the authors publish the code behind the work.</p>



<p>Roland Dunbrack, of Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, peer-reviewed the paper but was “not given access to code during the review,” the authors of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6ioZPbxiDZy5h4qxo-bHa0XOTOxEYHObht0SX8EgwfPHY_g/viewform">letter submitted today</a>, May 14, to <em>Nature</em> – including Dunbrack – write, “despite repeated requests.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01385-x"><em>Nature</em> podcast</a> said AlphaFold3 – unlike AlphaFold2 – “can accurately predict protein-molecule complexes containing DNA, RNA and more. Although the new version is restricted to non-commercial use, researchers are excited by its greater range of predictive abilities and the prospect of speedier drug discovery.”</p>



<span id="more-129223"></span>



<p>Not everyone was excited. The authors of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6ioZPbxiDZy5h4qxo-bHa0XOTOxEYHObht0SX8EgwfPHY_g/viewform">letter, which co-author Stephanie A. Wankowicz of the University of California, San Francisco told Retraction Watch was submitted today to Nature</a>, write they “were disappointed with the lack of code, or even executables accompanying the publication of AlphaFold3 in <em>Nature</em>.” They continue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Although AlphaFold3 expands AlphaFold2’s capacities to include small molecules, nucleic acids, and chemical modifications, it was released without the means to test and use the software in a high-throughput manner. This does not align with the principles of scientific progress, which rely on the ability of the community to evaluate, use, and build upon existing work. The high-profile publication advertises capabilities that remain locked behind the doors of the parent company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The authors, who are circulating the letter for additional signatures, write that “the model&#8217;s limited availability on a hosted web server, capped at ten predictions per day, restricts the scientific community&#8217;s capacity to verify the broad claims of the findings or apply the predictions on a large scale. Specifically, the inability to make predictions on novel organic molecules akin to chemical probes and drugs, one of the central claims of the paper, makes it impossible to test or use this method.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01383-z">May 8 news story</a> by the independent team of journalists at <em>Nature</em> noted the restrictions. <em>Nature</em> editor in chief Magdalena Skipper told Retraction Watch:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>Nature</em> has a long-standing <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards#availability-of-computer-code">policy</a> designed to facilitate the availability of data, materials and code upon reasonable request. While seeking to enhance transparency at every opportunity, <em>Nature</em> accepts that there may be circumstances under which research data or code are not openly available. When making a decision on data and code availability, we reflect on many different factors, including the potential implications for biosecurity and the ethical challenges this presents. In such cases we work with the authors to provide alternatives that will support reproducibility, for example through the provision of pseudocode, which is made available to the reviewers during peer review.</p>



<p>As noted in the code availability statement in the paper: AlphaFold 3 is available as a non-commercial usage only server at <a href="https://www.alphafoldserver.com/">https://www.alphafoldserver.com</a>, with restrictions on allowed ligands and covalent modifications. Pseudocode describing the algorithms is available in the Supplementary Information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pseudocode, however, “will require months of effort to turn into workable code that approximates the performance, wasting valuable time and resources,” the authors of the letter write. “Even if such a reimplementation is attempted, restricted access raises questions about whether the results could be fully validated.”</p>



<p>The authors of the letter continue:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>When journals fail to enforce their written policies about <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards">making code available to reviewers</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/initial-submission">alongside publications</a>, they demonstrate how these policies are applied inequitably and how editorial decisions do not align with the needs of the scientific community. While there is an ever-changing landscape of how science is performed and communicated, journals should uphold their role in the community by ensuring that science is reproducible upon dissemination, regardless of who the authors are.</p>

<p>A professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia who once served as a dean at the Stevens Institute of Technology in the United States, has received expressions of concern on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText=expression%20of%20concern&amp;highlight=true&amp;returnFacets=ALL&amp;returnType=SEARCH&amp;matchPubs=true&amp;refinements=Author:Yehia%20Massoud&amp;refinements=Author:Y.%20Massoud">93 of his conference proceedings</a> for what a publisher said were irrelevant self-citations and “artificially inflating the number of citations.”</p>



<p>The notes by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) on the work of Yehia Massoud, a professor of electrical and computer engineering,  take two forms. One reads:</p>



<span id="more-129216"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Expression of Concern: Concerns were raised regarding the high number of self-citations included by the authors in the reference section of this article. A subsequent review of the citations by a duly constituted committee found that many are irrelevant to the work presented in the article, and that the addition of these citations artificially increased the citation impact of one of the authors of the article, Yehia Massoud. The addition of irrelevant self-citations is a violation of IEEE’s Publication Principles and community standards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other reads:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Notes: Expression of Concern: After careful consideration by a duly constituted committee, an author of this article, Yehia Massoud, was found to have acted in violation of the IEEE Publication Principles by artificially inflating the number of citations to the article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The EOCs were posted in mid-March, IEEE told Retraction Watch. All of the papers were published more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Massoud, who according to his <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/itl/people/person/yehia-massoud">bio</a> remains a fellow of the IEEE, told Retraction Watch he disagrees with the EOCs and is “exploring various avenues to have these expressions reconsidered:”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I respectfully disagree with the IEEE’s expressions, which amount to a difference of opinion on a subjective matter. These expressions relate to papers that were peer reviewed and editorially accepted for publication more than a decade ago. The inclusion of self-references in these papers was appropriate and is a common practice in pioneering fields for completeness, research continuity and transparency. I am exploring options to have these expressions of concern reconsidered and removed, including by working collaboratively with IEEE on a mutually agreeable resolution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Massoud had an <em>IEEE </em>paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6144484">retracted</a> sometime around 2012 for similar reasons as part of a massive purge of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.362.6413.393">some 7,000 articles</a>. As his bio notes:</p>



<p>Prior to Stevens, he served as the head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) between 2012 and 2017. During that period, the ECE department saw a considerable growth in research expenditures, research output, industrial partnerships, undergraduate and graduate student enrollments, unrestricted funds and gifts, and recognition. The department also rose 26 positions in the U.S. News &amp; World Report department rankings.</p>



<p>Such rankings, as <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1887">we’ve noted</a>, rely heavily on citation metrics.</p>

<p>A study published in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth </em>explored the experiences of mothers of infants with orofacial clefts in Uganda, with the occurrence of cleft in children known to lead to feeding difficulties and malnutrition. The authors assessed the breastfeeding history of children with a cleft between 0 to 24 months old, including the use of prelacteal feeds, breast milk alternatives and feeding devices used.</p>
<p>Mothers of children with a cleft were invited to complete a survey and attend focus group discussions to explore their experiences of breastfeeding and the support they received. The study involved 32 mother-child pairs, with 25 mothers participating in the qualitative focus group and interviews. Participants frequently expressed difficulties with breastfeeding, with the use of cow’s milk often reported as an alternative due to the high cost of formula milk. The use of feeding devices was also frequently reported. Whilst participants indicated that family members and the hospital could provide social and feeding support, they also reported experiencing negative attitudes and social stigmatization from the community and shared concerns about their risk of anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>An article published in <em>BMC Oral Health</em> describes the development of a questionnaire to evaluate the understanding of cleft lip and palate (CLP) amongst recent dental graduates. In this study, a questionnaire to assess knowledge of CLP, early interventions, interdisciplinary care, and management options was developed and validated using three groups of subject matter experts, including orthodontists, paediatric dentists, and surgeons. The questionnaire was distributed to a cohort of graduates between the ages of 23 and 30 who were enrolled in a dental internship in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The authors identified that whilst graduates demonstrated a strong understanding of how to treat and manage CLP from a dental perspective, knowledge gaps were identified in aspects of care relating to possible risk factors and post-surgical complications. Additionally, whilst graduates identified the importance of interprofessional collaboration when managing CLP, knowledge of the specific roles of specialised healthcare professionals was not expressed by participants.</p>
<p>The authors propose that these knowledge gaps may be addressable by developing bespoke training and practical sessions during undergraduate education.</p>

<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an increased shift towards online and hybrid learning by higher education institutions, facilitating distance learning in undergraduate medical education. Whilst this has led to benefits such as the increased accessibility and geographical dissemination of resources and flexibility in learning options for students, online learning may be a barrier to education in regions with disparities in adequate internet access.</p>
<p>This study explored the outcomes of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on cleft lip and palate developed for undergraduate students in Indonesia in collaboration with Smile Train.  414 out of 717 participants completed the MOOC, with course competing students providing positive feedback about the course’s content and the support they received from teachers when enrolled. Challenges identified by students included difficulties with internet access, course scheduling and that some of the topics were perceived as being too advanced, which provides feedback for further course re-assignments.</p>
<p>Continued development of e-learning resources for undergraduate curricula may enhance the geographical dissemination of medical education and future quality of care in low resource settings, particularly for topics with known knowledge gaps such as cleft lip and palate.</p>

<p>The ability to generate high-quality images is a crucial part of surgical planning, for example when performing alveolar bone grafting for unilateral cleft lip and palate. Whilst traditional two-dimensional X-rays can be used, they may lack the detail required for precise planning. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans provide a comprehensive view of facial structures for alveolar bone graft, enabling surgeons to plan the grafting procedure more accurately and assess post-surgery outcomes.</p>
<p>The authors of a study in <em>BMC Oral Health</em> describe the application of a machine learning model using 3D U-net to automatically detect morphometric changes in scans taken before and after secondary alveolar bone grafting to assess the impact on the growth and development of the maxilla post-surgery. The study involved the analysis of archived images from 32 patients who had not previously undergone surgery or orthodontic treatment. Using the improved efficiency and accuracy of the machine learning model, the authors observed differences in growth trends between the cleft and non-cleft sides of the maxilla following surgery, with secondary alveolar bone grafting appearing to have a positive effect on the length of the maxilla and alveolar ridge, but limited benefit to the height and width of the maxilla on the cleft side.</p>
<p>More in-depth image analysis with machine learning methods may help improve surgical outcomes and inform better treatment approaches.</p>

<p>An Elsevier chemistry journal has marked <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?qs=%22expression%20of%20concern%22&amp;pub=Chemosphere&amp;cid=271852&amp;sortBy=date">more than 60 papers</a> with expressions of concern amid an investigation involving potential undisclosed conflicts of interest among editors, authorship irregularities and manipulation of peer reviews and citations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524008816">One of the notices</a>, published online April 11 in <em>Chemosphere</em>, reads, for example:</p>



<span id="more-129212"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns have been brought to the attention of the journal regarding:</p>



<ul>
<li>unusual changes to the authorship of the article prior to publication.</li>



<li>potential undisclosed conflicts of interest by a reviewer.</li>



<li>potential undisclosed conflicts of interest by the editor who handled the peer-review process for the article.</li>
</ul>



<p>The journal editors are investigating the article, including contacting the authors, in line with Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and Elsevier&#8217;s policies.</p>



<p>The Expression of Concern will remain appended to the article until the investigation has been completed. If the editors can reach a conclusion, they will take any action that is deemed necessary. If the editors have determined that they cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion with the information available to them, a further notification will be published to update the community.</p>

<p>Sleuths have flagged dozens of publications in <em>Chemosphere</em>. In December, for instance, an anonymous PubPeer comment listed several papers that were “part of a potential breach in the publication ethics as <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/87A4CAC90B526F773F36C93BC737B4">the editor is linked with the authors</a>.” In other cases, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/32B04AD9A0235DD21932848B9CF773">the handling editor was also an author</a> of the paper, another post pointed out.</p>



<p>The notices started to appear online in March. Papers in both special&nbsp; and regular issues of the journal seem to be affected.</p>

<p>The move follows a Retraction Watch story published in February that revealed the paper’s corresponding author, <a href="https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=hesalm&amp;lang=en">Almas Heshmati</a> of Jönköping University in Sweden, used Excel’s autofill function and other undisclosed operations to populate thousands of empty cells, or well over 10% of the dataset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a guest post on our blog, economist Gary Smith argued Heshmati and his coauthor had&nbsp; “<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/21/how-not-to-deal-with-missing-data-an-economists-take-on-a-controversial-study/">no justification</a>” for not describing what they had done. Smith also commented in <a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2024/02/retracted-paper-is-a-compelling-case-for-reform/">an article</a> for <em>Mind Matters</em> that “<a href="https://mindmatters.ai/2024/02/retracted-paper-is-a-compelling-case-for-reform/">the solution to an absence of data is not to fabricate data</a>.”</p>



<p>Less than three weeks after our report, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/22/exclusive-elsevier-to-retract-paper-by-economist-who-failed-to-disclose-data-tinkering/">Elsevier told us</a> it would pull the study, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022503">Green innovations and patents in OECD countries</a>,” which appeared last year in the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>. On May 4, the publisher issued a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018560">retraction notice</a> stating:</p>



<span id="more-129194"></span>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Concerns were raised about the data in this paper post-publication. The first author confirmed to the Editors that the data contained many gaps across countries and over time. The majority of the missing unit values appeared in beginning and end year years (1990–1992 and 2017–2018). To represent country data over time, the first author imputed the missing unit values using forward and backward trends based on three consecutive values in Excel. The first author claims that this resulted in a balanced dataset inclusive of the sample countries and further states that the imputation of missing values based on variable—specific trend will not change the result and large number of observations will produce more stable estimated coefficients.</p>



<p>However, the first author agrees that he has not explained the imputation in the data section of the article and the effects that the imputed data has on the result has not been tested. Since a total of 36 variables had missing units, few observations would have remained.</p>



<p>The Editors and the authors have concluded that the findings of the paper may be biased.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heshmati did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His paper has been cited twice, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including once in February.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0B5019C56E0A6ADCC0E1A2E485FDB8#5">PubPeer comment on the retraction</a>, sleuth Alexander Magazinov said “the imputation as described in the note is way more benign than the one described in the Retraction Watch blog post. Which description is more accurate?”</p>



<p>Heshmati has used the same dataset in past research. As <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/22/exclusive-elsevier-to-retract-paper-by-economist-who-failed-to-disclose-data-tinkering/">we reported</a> in February:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In 2020, he and two colleagues published <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-020-01986-1">a paper</a> in Empirical Economics, a Springer Nature title, that bore strong resemblance to the 2023 article and relied on the same patched-up dataset. The article mentioned neither the data gaps nor the Excel operations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The publisher told us at the time it was “looking into the matter carefully.” In a May 9 email, however, Deborah Kendall-Cheeseman, a communications manager at Springer Nature, told us:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I’m afraid we don’t have an update we can share at the moment but we’ll let you know once we do.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/paul-mccrory.jpeg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="214" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/paul-mccrory.jpeg?resize=214%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-124354" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Paul McCrory</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>More than two years after retracting an article by one of its former editors in chief for plagiarism, the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> has retracted six more pieces by the editor, Paul McCrory, a noted concussion researcher in Australia.</p>



<p>The retractions join 11 more of McCrory’s works, including 10 from <em>BJSM </em>and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/JSR.0000000000001125">one from <em>Current Sports Medicine Reports</em></a>.The <em>BJSM</em>, published by The BMJ, is also correcting two additional articles by McCrory.</p>



<p>Troubles for McCrory – for decades “the world’s foremost doctor shaping the concussion protocols that are used by sports leagues and organizations globally,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/sports/football/paul-mccrory-plagiarism-concussions.html">according to the <em>New York Times</em></a> – began in 2021 when Steve Haake, a professor at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/02/28/this-is-frankly-insulting-an-author-plagiarized-by-a-journal-editor-speaks/">told the <em>BJSM</em></a> McCrory had plagiarized a 2000 article by Haake in <em>Physics World</em>. (It would <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/11/neri-oxman-accused-of-lifting-from-article-whose-plagiarism-led-to-downfall-of-concussion-expert/">not be the only time</a> the work was plagiarized.)</p>



<span id="more-129190"></span>



<p>The journal retracted the offending editorial in February 2022, with McCrory apologizing for the “isolated incident.” McCrory told us at the time that he was “sincerely sorry that this has happened and caused [Haake] and his team hurt.” He said he would be requesting another of his articles be retracted.</p>



<p>By then, however, sleuth Nick Brown had started looking into McCrory’s work, and he <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/02/was-leading-sports-medicine-researchers-plagiarism-an-isolated-and-unfortunate-incident/">found more problems</a>. In October of that year, the journal retracted <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/10/concussion-researcher-paul-mccrory-earns-nine-more-retractions-nearly-40-expressions-of-concern/">nine more of McCrory’s single-authored editorials</a>, and placed expressions of concern on nearly 40, the total they said they could find in their archives. They revised that number upward significantly after we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/16/bmj-says-its-an-ongoing-effort-to-find-articles-by-concussion-researcher-paul-mccrory/">pointed out that we found 78 such articles</a>, and told us the expressions of concern would remain unless they were replaced with retraction notices.</p>



<p>McCrory, whose University of Melbourne email address no longer seems to work, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/concussion-kingpin-resigns-global-post-over-plagiarism-scandal">resigned from key posts</a> in the wake of the scandal. The <em>BJSM </em>said he <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/23/1327.responses">agreed with the new retractions</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement today, the journal said the retractions and corrections “conclude BMJ’s investigation into research integrity issues concerning Paul McCrory.” The University of Melbourne had also requested an investigation, the journal said.</p>



<p>“As no further concerns have been raised with BMJ about Dr McCrory’s authorship in BMJ journals, no further action will be taken,” Helen Macdonald, the BMJ’s publication ethics and content integrity editor, said in the statement.</p>



<p>Macdonald left open the possibility the McCrory saga is not over: “But should any further allegations be made about Dr McCrory’s work published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine or in any of the other titles in BMJ’s journal portfolio, these will be investigated.”</p>

                <p><br /></p>
<p>A recent study published in Nature has identified blood protein biomarkers that could be used to predict the risk of developing dementia, up to 15 years before diagnosis in clinic. Given that there is currently no cure, early preventative action could prove crucial in our fight against dementia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the time of presenting to the clinic, when a person is experiencing symptoms that impact on their daily life, the pathology in the brain is typically very advanced. Any potential treatment options or interventions may be being delivered too late. However, these potential treatments can have much more impact on slowing, stopping, or reversing decline if we can intervene earlier before significant damage is done. Dementia is very difficult to treat, but early detection affords new opportunities for early intervention.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Guo et al. analysed data from 52,645 adults (without a dementia diagnosis) who were followed up for up to 14.1 years, with their blood samples analysed repeatedly over this time. By the end of the study period, 1,417 of these participants had developed dementia. Using data from the UK Biobank, it was found that of 1,463 proteins in the blood plasma, changes in the levels of two proteins, GFAP and LTBP2, had high specificity for predicting cases of dementia. This study is a great example of how advances in proteomics and other scientific techniques can be used to provide new insights into large longitudinal datasets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A biomarker is an objective indication of disease that can be accurately and reproducibly measured.  Blood biomarkers are particularly promising, as they are minimally invasive to obtain and relatively cheap to process. This in turn means that they are also a scalable option, suitable to screen large numbers of the population for early signs of disease – in this case, dementia. The Guo et al. study concludes that people with high levels of a specific protein in their blood are more than twice as likely as people with normal levels to develop dementia, and nearly three times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nonetheless, whilst the findings are promising, we must be cautious. Further validation of the new potential blood-based biomarkers is needed and a better understanding of how these changes in protein differ between disease must be a focus for future research.</p>
