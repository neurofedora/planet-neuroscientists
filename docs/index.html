<p><strong>A get-sober pill? </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 18, 1972</p>



<p>Researchers at the Tucson Veterans Administration Hospital have been able to reduce intoxication time in rats by administrating harmless chemicals…. Injections of vitamin B3, and vitamin B5 with cystine, were successful&#8230; Glyceraldehyde, however, was effective when ingested and sodium acetate (still untested orally) is expected to be even more effective.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Inebriation and the dreaded hangover that follows still don’t have cures — but scientists haven’t stopped searching. A compound in the seeds of Japanese raisin trees appeared to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drug-gives-rats-booze-guzzling-superpowers">fend off drunkenness in rats</a> and sober them up (<em>SN: 1/4/12</em>), but follow-up research found <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33656905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no effect</a>. Remedies that <em>have</em> worked in rodents have not yet led to treatments for people. </p>



<p>In July, an antihangover supplement became available in the United Kingdom and may soon appear in U.S. stores. The Swedish company that makes this probiotic pill, Myrkle (pronounced &#8220;miracle&#8221;), claims that it can break down <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/11786388221108919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent of the alcohol</a> in a person’s system in one hour. But the claim is based on a single study conducted by the company. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-health-risk-water">‘Forever chemicals’ may pose a bigger risk to our health than scientists thought</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">For decades, chemicals that make life easier — your eggs slide out of the frying pan, stains don’t stick to your sofa, rain bounces off your jackets and boots — have been touted as game changers for our busy modern lives. “Better things for better living … through chemistry,” was the optimistic slogan coined by DuPont, the company that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/materials-plastics-polymers-fiber-optics-history">invented the widely used chemical coating Teflon</a>.</p>



<p>But this better living has come at a cost that is getting new attention. These chemicals — dubbed forever chemicals for their ability to last in the environment — are proving to have a lasting impact on human health. A growing body of research links the group of chemicals broadly known as PFAS, short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, to conditions from unhealthy blood lipid levels to pregnancy complications to cancer.</p>





<p>Alarm about the health impacts of these chemicals has sparked a recent flurry of action from U.S. public health and regulatory officials. Warning that PFAS pose a greater health risk than previously thought, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in June <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-new-drinking-water-health-advisories-pfas-chemicals-1-billion-bipartisan#:~:text=EPA&#039;s%20lifetime%20health%20advisories%20identify,these%20PFAS%20in%20drinking%20water." target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatically lowered its recommended safe levels</a> of the chemicals in drinking water.</p>



<p>“The updated advisory levels are based on new science, including more than 400 recent studies which indicate that negative health effects may occur at extremely low levels, much lower than previously understood,” Radhika Fox, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Water, said in June at the <a href="https://pfasproject.com/conference-presentations/2022-pfas-conference/#:~:text=2022%20Third%20National%20PFAS%20Conference%20The%203rd%20National,to%20discuss%20how%20best%20to%20address%20PFAS%20contamination." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third National PFAS Conference</a>, held in Wilmington, N.C.</p>



<p>Soon after, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released the <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26156/guidance-on-pfas-exposure-testing-and-clinical-follow-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first clinical guidelines quantifying blood concentration levels of PFAS</a> that could put someone’s health at risk. The 300-page report urges clinicians to recommend regular blood tests for anyone exposed to high levels of the chemicals and to provide information on how to limit exposure, such as <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/news/not-all-home-drinking-water-filters-completely-remove-toxic-pfas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing special filters</a> known to reduce PFAS in drinking water.</p>



<p>In the United States alone, by one measure, the tally in medical care costs and lost productivity from PFAS exposure linked to five medical conditions <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12403-022-00496-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adds up to at least $5.5 billion annually</a>, researchers at New York University reported July 26 in <em>Exposure and Health</em>. Those conditions include low birth weight, childhood obesity, hypothyroidism in women, and kidney and testicular cancers. </p>



<p>“We only looked at two of the more than 9,000 chemicals in the PFAS family, so we’re just seeing the tip of an iceberg,” says Leonardo Trasande, a pediatrician and environmental health expert at NYU Langone Health.</p>

<h4>Ubiquitous chemicals</h4>



<p>Among those most at risk of exposure are firefighters: PFAS make protective gear more water resistant, and the chemicals are found in a widely used fire suppressant foam. But most people have some measurable level of PFAS in their bodies, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exposure typically comes from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineering-clean-drinking-water-treatment-pollution">ingesting PFAS-contaminated drinking water</a> or food grown in soil treated with fertilizers made from sewage contaminated with the chemicals (<em>SN: 11/24/18, p. 18</em>). An estimated 2,854 locations across the United States have PFAS contamination.</p>





<p>“People and communities have had significant exposure to these chemicals. If they can ID that they are in an area of significant exposure, they should seek testing through their usual source of care,” says Ned Calonge, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora who chaired the committee that wrote the National Academies report. The committee linked PFAS exposure to a slightly different list of conditions than the NYU team, finding “sufficient evidence” linking PFAS to four conditions: poor antibody response to vaccination, abnormally high cholesterol levels, decreased infant and fetal growth, and kidney cancer. Evidence was “suggestive” for breast and testicular cancers, as well as thyroid problems and ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease. </p>



<p>The report calls for more research into the health effects of PFAS, noting gaps in evidence on everything from neurological issues to bone density. These chemicals have a wide range of impacts on multiple systems in the body, Calonge says. And they’re “ubiquitous in the environment.”</p>

<h4>Newer, not safer</h4>



<p>PFAS have been produced in the United States since the 1940s. Because they are good at repelling oil and water, holding up at high temperatures and reducing friction, the chemicals became useful for a vast array of products, including carpeting, upholstery, food packaging and even dental floss. Yet, relatively few of the 9,000 or so versions of these synthetic chemicals have been studied for their toxicologic effects. </p>



<p>Many PFAS are now recognized as endocrine disruptors, chemical compounds that interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine, or hormonal, system. But <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1668/htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFAS have other effects that can boost cancer risk</a>, such as weakened immunity, excessive cell growth and altered gene activity. One study <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/113/5/580/5906528?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a greater than twofold increase in kidney cancer risk</a> between people with the highest versus lowest blood levels of one common PFAS called perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, researchers reported in 2021 in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>.</p>



<p>A newer generation of PFAS was assumed to be safer because the chemicals <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-10/genx-final-tox-assessment-general_factsheet-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are less likely to accumulate in the body</a>. But these newer compounds are structurally similar to the older ones and can be just as harmful to health as their cousins, Trasande says. These newer molecules “are increasingly being associated with diseases like gestational diabetes. We’re just starting to see the bigger problem that might be at play.”</p>



<p>The EPA’s new drinking water advisory aims to tackle both old and new PFAS. It targets two of the earlier and most commonly found kinds of PFAS in the environment: PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS. The advisory reduces the level of drinking water contamination below which adverse health effects are not expected from 70 parts per trillion to 0.004 and 0.02 ppt, respectively. Those levels are based on routine exposure to them over a lifetime.</p>



<p>The EPA’s health advisory also provided the first-ever recommendations on two of the newer kinds of PFAS: hexa­fluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and HFPO ammonium salt, collectively known as GenX chemicals, and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid, or PFBS. The agency set the drinking water safety threshold at 10 ppt for GenX chemicals and 2,000 ppt for PFBS. These newer chemicals have similar persistence in the environment, the agency states.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>Health impacts</h3>



<p>A National Academies panel found sufficient and suggestive evidence that PFAS boost risk for several ailments.&nbsp;<br>* in adults, † in children</p>



<h6>Sufficient evidence</h6>



<ul><li>Poor antibody response to vaccination *†</li><li>Abnormally high cholesterol levels *†</li><li>Decreased infant and fetal growth</li><li>Kidney cancer *</li></ul>



<h6>Suggestive evidence</h6>



<ul><li>Breast cancer *</li><li>Liver enzyme alterations *†</li><li>Pregnancy-induced hypertension *</li><li>Testicular cancer *</li><li>Thyroid disorders * </li><li>Ulcerative colitis *</li></ul>
</div>



<p>Consumers can ask their municipal water provider for data on PFAS testing in their area. Testing is becoming more common, and providers should be able to list which PFAS they test for. Private wells can be contaminated with PFAS if they are near manufacturers that produce or use the chemicals, as well as airfields where PFAS are used for firefighting, firefighting training areas and some waste disposal sites. People with private wells near one of these facilities can get their water tested. The EPA is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwcapacity/wiin-grant-small-underserved-and-disadvantaged-communities-grant-program-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving grants</a> to help underserved small and disadvantaged communities provide household water quality testing and comply with drinking water regulations.</p>



<h4>PFAS price tag</h4>



<p>Because there are limited available data on the health effects of the newer generation of chemicals, the NYU and National Academies reports focused on the impacts of older PFAS.</p>



<p>First, the NYU team examined PFAS chemicals in blood samples obtained from roughly 5,000 adults and children who participated in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Then, based on earlier studies linking PFAS to certain diseases and models that estimate medical costs and lost worker productivity for these illnesses, the team came up with its PFAS price tag.</p>



<p>Childhood obesity, the largest contributor to the overall economic toll of PFAS exposure, costs about $2.7 billion a year, the team estimates, followed by hypothyroidism in women at $1.26 billion. When the researchers considered other PFAS-linked diseases beyond the top five, such as endometriosis, obesity in adults and pneumonia in children, the estimated economic burden rose to as much as $63 billion annually.</p>



<h4>Assessing risk</h4>



<p>The National Academies report focused in part on how to curb that toll by providing testing guidelines to clinicians to detect high levels of PFAS in the body and try to reduce exposure.</p>



<p>The report provides the first clinical guidelines on how to assess a person’s disease risk. A person with a PFAS blood concentration of less than 2 nanograms per milliliter doesn’t have to worry. But for patients with blood concentrations between 2 and 20 ng/mL, clinicians should screen for conditions like unhealthy levels of fat in the blood, which can lead to heart problems. Such screening is especially important for people more vulnerable to the effects of PFAS exposure, like children, pregnant people and those who are immunocompromised. For anyone who tests above 20 ng/mL, the report encourages routine screenings for some cancers, thyroid problems and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>“For almost 20 years, we’ve been able to measure PFAS in people’s blood, but there was no guidance to say what [those measurements] mean,” says National Academies report coauthor Jane Hoppin, who heads the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “For the first time, this actually sets some ranges, some guidance for what could be levels of concern, and what kinds of health follow-up might be appropriate.”</p>



<p>She hopes that the recommendations will increase testing availability and make both doctors and patients more aware of these chemicals and their health risks. The report also encourages doctors to work with their patients to figure out where they are being exposed to PFAS and how to mitigate those risks, by cutting down on PFAS-containing products and filtering water.</p>



<p>Activated carbon filters, found in some countertop or pitcher filters, don’t remove PFAS as completely as reverse osmosis filters, researchers at Duke University and North Carolina State reported in 2020. The National Academies report offers a link to NSF, a testing organization that offers <a href="https://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/Listings.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CPFOA+Reduction&amp;ProductFunction=053%7CPFOS+Reduction&amp;ProductFunction=P473%7CPFOA+Reduction&amp;ProductFunction=P473%7CPFOS+Reduction&amp;ProductType=&amp;submit2=Search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical details</a> on which filters actually filter out PFAS.</p>



<p>Efforts like reducing PFAS in drinking water could help. While EPA’s health advisories are recommendations and not enforceable, Trasande is pleased that the agency acted quickly, particularly on newer chemicals like GenX. But he argues that in light of what we already know and are continuing to learn about the disease burden caused by these chemicals, PFAS should undergo more testing before they are approved. Better yet, they should be regulated by class instead of taking what he calls a whack-a-mole approach.</p>



<p>“Our environmental policy still takes a wait-and-see approach that we should wait 20 to 30 years, which is the time that people take to develop diseases due to chemical exposures,” he says.</p>

                <p>Scientists have found that bats use distinct structures in the larynx to produce high-frequency echolocation calls and lower-frequency social calls. Surprisingly, the structures used to make the low-pitched calls are analogous to those used by death metal vocalists in their growls. See our study summary of the findings from Coen Elemans at the University of Southern Denmark and colleagues below, or jump to the <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a> in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>



<h5><strong>Background and Study Design</strong></h5>

<p>Echolocating bats have an extremely large vocal range of 7 octaves, compared to just 3 to 4 octaves for most mammals, including humans. Their echolocating calls and social calls range between 1 and 120 kilohertz, making them unique among mammals. To understand how different vocal structures allow bats to create such a wide range of calls, researchers extracted the larynx from five adult Daubenton&rsquo;s bats (<em>Myotis daubentonii</em>), mounted and filmed them at 250,000 frames per second while applying a flow of air to mimic natural vocalization. They then used machine learning to reconstruct the motion of vocal membranes that were obscured by other structures.</p>



<h5><strong>Findings</strong></h5>



<p>They found that air pressure generated self-sustaining vibrations in the vocal membrane at frequencies between 10 and 70 kilohertz, sufficient to produce high-frequency echolocation calls. In contrast, thick folds of membrane just above the vocal cords, called &ldquo;ventricular folds,&rdquo; vibrated at frequencies between 1 and 3 kilohertz, and are likely involved in producing the animals&rsquo; lower-frequency social calls. Some humans also use their ventricular folds to produce low-frequency vocalizations, such as death metal growls and Tuvan throat singing.</p>



<h5><strong>Further Insights</strong></h5>



<p>The study is the first to directly observe self-sustained vibrations in bat vocal structures that can generate echolocation and social calls. Natural selection to produce high-frequency calls for echolocating prey and much lower-frequency calls for social communication have created distinct evolutionary pressures that expanded the vocal range of bats, the authors say.</p>



<p>The authors add, &ldquo;We show that bats vibrate extremely thin and light membranes extending from their vocal folds to make their high-frequency ultrasonic calls for echolocation. To extend their limited lower vocal range, bats make aggressive calls with their ventricular folds &ndash; as in death metal growls.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dry-cat-dog-food-environmentally-friendly-than-wet">Dry pet food may be more environmentally friendly than wet food</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pet owners may have a new reason to reach for the kibble.</p>



<p>Dry cat and dog food tends to be better for the environment than wet food, veterinary nutritionist Vivian Pedrinelli of the University of São Paulo in Brazil and colleagues report. Their analysis of more than 900 hundred pet diets shows that nearly 90 percent of calories in wet chow comes from animal sources. That’s roughly double the share of calories from animal ingredients in dry food.</p>





<p>The team factored in the cost of different pet food ingredients across several environmental measures. The findings, described November 17 in<em> Scientific Reports</em>, suggest that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22631-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wet food production uses more land and water</a> and emits more greenhouse gases than dry food. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">meat-heavy human diets drive greenhouse gas emissions</a> <em>(SN: 5/5/22)</em>. But when it comes to environmental sustainability, “we shouldn’t ignore pet food,” says Peter Alexander, an economist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>Just how much various pet foods impact the environment isn’t clear, Alexander says. Commercial cat and canine fares aren’t typically made from prime cuts of meat. Instead, the ingredient lists often include animal byproducts — the gristle and bits people aren’t likely to eat anyway.</p>



<p>How to calculate the carbon cost of these leftovers is an ongoing debate, says Gregory Okin, an environmental scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Some argue that the byproducts in pet food are essentially free, since they come from animals already raised for human consumption. Others note that any calories require energy and therefore incur an environmental cost. Plus, animal ingredients in pet food might not be just scraps. If they contain even a small amount of human-edible meat, that could add up to a big&nbsp;impact.</p>



<p>Knowing that there’s an environmental difference between moist morsels and crunchier cuisines could be helpful for eco-conscious pet owners, Okin says. Having that info handy at the grocery store is “super important when people are making decisions,” he adds. “There are consumers who want to pay attention.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/researchers-fill-the-gaps-long-covid-data">How researchers are working to fill the gaps in long COVID data</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s been more than two years since the first long COVID patients <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-recovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called attention to their condition</a>. But researchers are still unable to answer basic questions about it, such as how vaccination impacts one’s chances of long-term symptoms or which groups of people are most at-risk, thanks to gaping holes in long COVID data.</p>



<p>Some data gaps originated early in the pandemic. For instance, in spring 2020, people who lacked a travel history to China or didn’t have typical flulike symptoms were unable to get a PCR test to confirm they were infected. So when some of those people later developed long COVID, their initial illness had not been logged in medical records — making it difficult for them to get care and keeping them off most researchers’ radar.</p>





<p>Other data gaps reveal long-standing problems in how the medical system treats complex, chronic diseases. Doctors weren’t looking out for long-term symptoms, despite warnings from experts in other postviral diseases. And some of the most common long COVID symptoms, such as a dramatic worsening of health after exertion, lack a standard code for documentation in medical charts, making them hard to track.</p>



<p>Filling in those gaps is becoming increasingly crucial. Studies suggest that between 10 and 30 percent of people with COVID-19 may experience long-term symptoms, ranging from a simple loss of smell and taste to debilitating cognitive challenges. In the United States alone, that adds up to millions of people who, long after the pandemic ends, may still be dealing with the consequences of the disease.</p>



<p>The urgency of supporting these patients has led to a push for greater collaboration, new technologies and perhaps most important of all, an openness to really listen to long COVID patients, believing in and using their experiences to shape future research.</p>



<h4>What is long COVID?</h4>



<p>To inform potential treatments, researchers aim to better characterize the causes of and variations in long COVID’s wide range of symptoms. Currently, long COVID tends to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus">defined broadly</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/22</em>). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention characterizes it as a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“wide range of ongoing health problems”</a> that can last for months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.</p>



<p>The electronic health records that researchers use to study long COVID aren’t comprehensive, however, due to gaps in the data. Records often focus disproportionately on people who could get a PCR or antibody test, were hospitalized and had predominantly respiratory symptoms, says Lisa McCorkell, a public policy researcher and cofounder of <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Patient-Led Research Collaborative</a>, a group of long COVID patients who also have research experience.</p>



<p>What’s more, records “do not document all of the symptoms the patient experiences,” she says. And for many patients, information about different symptoms can be spread across different healthcare systems, making it difficult for researchers to connect the dots.</p>





<p>“A long COVID diagnosis can mean so many different things in your physiology are going wrong,” says David Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation at the Mount Sinai healthcare system in New York City and leader of one of the first labs to focus on long COVID. More comprehensive tracking of patients’ symptoms, he says, is crucial to better understand how long COVID presents itself and document how it impacts patients’ lives.</p>



<p>To achieve this goal, experts say, future data collection must be designed collaboratively. Coordination between patients and researchers helps ensure studies are asking the right questions, while coordination between experts with different specialties promotes multidisciplinary, creative approaches to a condition that impacts every organ system in the body. Coordination between research groups in different locations is also important for producing inclusive datasets.</p>



<p>New studies currently in early phases across the United States provide models for how scientists can work with patients and across specialties to investigate long COVID, learning from mistakes made earlier in the pandemic. The results of this work could inform strategies for patients to manage their symptoms and lead to potential treatments.</p>



<h4>Asking the right questions</h4>



<p>Some of the most influential research on long COVID so far has come from patients themselves, including a 2021 study from the Patient-Led Research Collaborative that <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents more than 200 potential symptoms</a>.</p>



<p>“Patients know the right questions to ask to properly document their experience,” McCorkell says. This can include which symptoms are studied, how data are collected from patients and how groups of patients are compared.</p>



<p>For example, one common flaw in research design is that potential long COVID patients might be included in a study’s control group (that is, with the assumption that they do not have the condition) because they lack a positive test result or “do not have the exact symptoms a study defines as being long COVID,” McCorkell explains. Since many long COVID patients — especially those who got sick early in the pandemic — lack positive test results, such a control group can skew study findings because researchers are comparing two groups of people that, potentially, both include patients with long COVID.</p>



<p>To avoid these problems, researchers can solicit feedback from patients during all parts of the scientific process. The Patient-Led Research Collaborative required this type of engagement for applicants to <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/projects/patient-led-research-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $5-million research fund</a> run by the collaborative: The <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/press-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning projects</a>, announced on November 22, were reviewed by a panel of patient experts and will incorporate further patient feedback throughout the research process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Putrino’s lab is taking a similar approach in setting up a new clinic focused on long COVID and other complex, chronic illnesses. The lab has a “lived experience advisory board” that responds to questions ranging from how the clinic’s waiting room should be set up to how healthcare workers ask patient survey questions, Putrino says.</p>



<p>Surveys have become a particularly valuable tool in long COVID research, filling the gaps left by electronic health records. Health records are “the clunkiest part of this research,” says Arjun Venkatesh, a patient-reported outcomes researcher at Yale University who is investigating <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/ycci/trial/inspire-covid-19-study-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19’s long-term impacts</a>. While new web applications and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/06/health-data-information-blocking-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> have made it easier for patients to access their medical records, researchers still face many technical and data security barriers to connecting datasets from different health systems.</p>



<p>Venkatesh and his colleagues use surveys to collect basic information, such as a patient’s vaccine record, as well as metrics that typically wouldn’t be in an electronic health record, such as their fatigue levels over time. In setting up these surveys, it’s important to solicit input from patients, Venkatesh and others say. Filling out a survey could trigger common long COVID symptoms like brain fog or post-exertion pain and fatigue. Responsible researchers ask a small group of patient volunteers to test surveys before they are widely released.</p>



<p>Input from patients is also crucial in designing clinical trials for long COVID, says Julia Moore Vogel, a program director at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego. People living with the condition have spent time reading studies, comparing notes and testing out symptom management techniques. “There’s actually a decent amount of anecdotal data we can use to inform trials,” she says.</p>



<p>Anecdotal data inspired a study that Vogel, a long-hauler herself, is starting. She is aiming to enroll 5,000 patients who will test how well a wearable device helps them manage their symptoms, using a technique called pacing. Some Garmin health trackers have a feature called “body battery,” which combines several measurements to determine the user’s capacity for exertion. Vogel and other long-haulers use this feature to monitor their activity, stopping to rest when their “battery” gets low. Her new study aims to test the strategy on a larger scale.</p>



<h4>Making connections across specialties and locations</h4>



<p>The number of people impacted by long COVID is unprecedented. But the condition shares many characteristics with other complex, chronic diseases that arise after infections and affect multiple organ systems, such as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS</a>. These conditions have historically received limited research funding even though they impact millions of people — a problem attributed in part to the diseases’ inability to fit into a specific medical specialty, says Jaime Seltzer, director of scientific and medical outreach at the ME/CFS advocacy group #MEAction, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif.</p>



<p>Funding from the National Institutes of Health, for example, is allocated to research groups through the agency’s topic-focused institutes and centers. “Every disease is supposed to neatly and nicely fit into these categories,” Seltzer says. “And if it doesn&#8217;t, everyone goes, ‘It’s not my problem.’” Conditions like ME/CFS and long COVID also are not taught in medical schools, leading to a general lack of awareness among doctors about how to properly diagnose them, she says, which results in incomplete datasets.</p>



<p>To push back against this fractured system, doctors and researchers need to collaborate across specialties, experts say. Scientists with different types of expertise are starting to work together to design comprehensive studies, share data and educate each other about new techniques. The <a href="https://lc19.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long COVID Research Consortium</a> is one such group: Researchers with different specialties are investigating the condition’s underlying biology, with data shared across the participating teams.</p>



<p>“We’re going to be setting up our own data-sharing platform,” says consortium member Richard Scheuermann, director of informatics at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Data from studies of long COVID patients’ microbiomes, immune systems, lungs and other areas will all be in “the same database,” he says, enabling research that connects the different body systems.</p>

<p>Collaboration between scientists in different places is also crucial to producing research that reflects a diverse patient population. One example is the National Institutes of Health’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-risk-nih-recover-symptoms">RECOVER initiative to learn about the long-term health effects</a> of COVID-19 (<em>SN: 10/24/22</em>).</p>



<p>The initiative’s adult study has recruited about 10,000 people from <a href="https://studies.recovercovid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53 sites all over the United States and Puerto Rico</a>. But Putrino would like to see the federal government go further by recruiting more patients, collaborating more closely with patient advocacy groups, educating providers and integrating research with efforts to directly help long-haulers, such as <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/long-covid-barriers-government-disability-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aid with disability benefits applications</a>.</p>



<p>Create “a set of common data elements that every site collects, so that every site around the country can contribute to a national registry of people with long COVID,” Putrino says. Such a registry, similar to <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/registries/cancer_registry/cancer_registry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing registries for cancer patients</a>, would help researchers better understand the different potential subtypes of long COVID and provide a large population ready to volunteer for clinical trials.</p>



<p>As researchers recruit for large studies of long COVID, they should reach out to communities that are less educated about the condition, says Dona Kim Murphey, a physician, neuroscientist and long-hauler based in Houston. “How do you reach the folks who don&#8217;t even know to come to you?” she asks. Public education campaigns about long COVID — combined with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-clinics-map-locations-prevalence">easier access to healthcare for people facing long-term symptoms</a> — can contribute to more comprehensive patient datasets (<em>SN: 11/3/22</em>).</p>



<p>Some long COVID researchers are using new technology to better understand the condition, such as wearable devices, survey apps and machine learning for analysis. But models for comprehensive, collaborative research that includes all patients with a complex condition don’t need to be reinvented. As an example, Seltzer points to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6706a1.htm?s_cid=ss6706a1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2014 CDC initiative to study autism</a>, in which 11 sites across the country worked together to diagnose children while simultaneously educating clinicians about autism.</p>



<p>“They basically had diagnostic experts in autism train other people to become diagnostic experts in autism,” she says. The study is a model in creating an inclusive dataset, while simultaneously enabling a new group of researchers to better study a condition in the future. Seltzer hopes to see federal agencies enable similar large-scale studies for long COVID and related conditions.</p>



<p>As some long COVID patients enter their fourth year with the condition and more people continue to get infected, moving toward impactful clinical trials is a top priority for scientists. “Design research in a way that’s going to be most effective to the end users, who are the patients,” says Vogel, the Scripps researcher. Going forward, this research model could be valuable for other complex diseases, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2022/11/28/encoding-and-retrieval-in-a-model-of-the-hippocampal-ca1-microcircuit.html">Encoding and retrieval in a model of the hippocampal CA1 microcircuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>This week on Journal Club session Eleonora Bernasconi will talk about a paper &quot;Encoding and retrieval in a model of the hippocampal CA1 microcircuit&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It has been proposed that the hippocampal theta rhythm (4- 7 Hz) can
contribute to memory formation by separating encoding (storage) and retrieval
of memories into different functional half- cycles (Hasselmo et al. (2002)
Neural Comput 14:793- 817). We investigate, via computer simulations,
the biophysical mechanisms by which storage and recall of spatio-temporal input
patterns are achieved by the CA1 microcircuitry. A model of the CA1
microcircuit is presented that uses biophysical representations of the major
cell types, including pyramidal (P) cells and four types of inhibitory
interneurons: basket (B) cells, axo-axonic (AA) cells, bistratified (BS) cells
and oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells. Inputs to the network come from
the entorhinal cortex (EC), the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and medial septum. The
EC input provides the sensory information, whereas all other inputs provide
context and timing information. Septal input provides timing information for
phasing storage and recall. Storage is accomplished via a local STDP mediated
hetero-association of the EC input pattern and the incoming CA3 input pattern
on the CA1 pyramidal cell target synapses. The model simulates the timing of
firing of different hippocampal cell types relative to the theta rhythm in
anesthetized animals and proposes experimentally confirmed functional roles for
the different classes of inhibitory interneurons in the storage and recall
cycles (Klausberger et al., (2003, 2004) Nature 421:844- 848, Nat
Neurosci 7:41- 47). Measures of recall performance of new and
previously stored input patterns in the presence or absence of various
inhibitory interneurons are employed to quantitatively test the performance of
our model. Finally, the mean recall quality of the CA1 microcircuit is tested
as the number of stored patterns is increased.</p>

                <p>The idea that meditation is a "mind science" is popular, but in this interview Canadian philosopher Evan Thompson argues that this claim does not stand up to either scientific or philosophical scrutiny. As one of the pioneers of the Embodied Cognition movement Thompson reminds us that the Mind is not restricted to the Brain and we must also consider how other recent discoveries in neuroscience fail to support the claim that meditation provides neutral scientific insight into how the Mind really works.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li>Evan Thompson's <a href="https://evanthompson.me" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">website</a></li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Oj0f7g" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Why I am not a Buddhist</em></a> by Evan Thompson</li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Oj0f7g" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers</em></a> by Kwame Anthony Appiah</li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3N7Vwmr" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience</em></a> by Francisco J.

<h5><strong>Background</strong></h5>



<p>For much of ancient Roman history, Roman mints produced coins featuring portraits of current emperors. In 1713, a group of such coins was allegedly discovered in Transylvania, some of them featuring a portrait labeled with the name &ldquo;Sponsian,&rdquo; although there are no other historical records that a Roman emperor named Sponsian ever existed.</p>

<p>While the Transylvanian coins follow the general style of mid-third century Roman coins, they diverge in certain stylistic characteristics and in how they were manufactured, leading many experts to dismiss them as forgeries created to sell to collectors. However, the coins are also uncharacteristic of the forgeries that would have been of interest to past collectors. Additionally, in 1713, &ldquo;Sponsian&rdquo; was not yet known to be a name that had ever existed in ancient Rome.</p>



<h5><strong>Study Design and Findings</strong></h5>



<p>To further investigate the Transylvanian coins&rsquo; authenticity, Pearson and colleagues conducted a deeper assessment of the physical characteristics of four of the coins, including the Sponsian coin. They applied visible light microscopy, ultra-violet imaging, scanning electron microscopy, and reflection mode Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy to the four coins and, for comparison, two undoubtedly authentic Roman gold coins.</p>



<p>The analysis revealed deep micro-abrasion patterns typically associated with coins that were in circulation for an extensive period of time. The researchers also analyzed earthen deposits on the coins, finding evidence that after extensive circulation, the coins were buried for a prolonged period before being exhumed. Together, the new evidence strongly suggests the coins are authentic.</p>



<h5><strong>Conclusions</strong></h5>



<p>Considering the historical record alongside the new evidence from the coins, the researchers suggest that Sponsian was an army commander in the Roman Province of Dacia during a period of military strife in the 260s CE.</p>



<p>Lead author of the paper, Paul N. Pearson of University College, London, adds: &ldquo;Scientific analysis of these ultra-rare coins rescues the emperor Sponsian from obscurity. Our evidence suggests he ruled Roman Dacia, an isolated gold mining outpost, at a time when the empire was beset by civil wars and the borderlands were overrun by plundering invaders.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Curator of Numismatics at The Hunterian, Jesper Ericsson, adds: &ldquo;This has been a really exciting project for The Hunterian. Not only do we hope that this encourages further debate about Sponsian as a historical figure, but also the investigation of coins relating to him held in other museums across Europe.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-bright-blazar-space">Here’s why some supermassive black holes blaze so brightly</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed how certain supermassive black holes launch jets of high-energy particles into space — and the process is shocking.</p>



<p>Shock waves propagating along the jet of one such blazar <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05338-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contort magnetic fields that accelerate escaping particles</a> to nearly the speed of light, astronomers report November 23 in <em>Nature</em>. Studying such extreme acceleration can help probe fundamental physics questions that can’t be studied any other way.</p>



<p>Blazars are active black holes that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/source-blazars-super-brightness-comes-focus">shoot jets of high-energy particles toward Earth</a>, making them appear as bright spots from millions or even billions of light-years away (<em>SN: 7/14/15</em>). Astronomers knew that the jets’ extreme speeds and tight columnated beams had something to do with the shape of magnetic fields around black holes, but the details were fuzzy.</p>





<p>Enter the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer, or IXPE, an orbiting telescope launched in December 2021. Its mission is to measure X-ray polarization, or how X-ray light is oriented as it travels through space. While previous blazar observations of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">polarized radio waves and optical light</a> probed parts of jets days to years after they’d been accelerated, polarized X-rays can see into a blazar’s active core (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>“In X-rays, you’re really looking at the heart of the particle acceleration,” says astrophysicist Yannis Liodakis of the University of Turku in Finland. “You’re really looking at the region where everything happens.”</p>



<p>In March 2022, IPXE looked at an especially bright blazar called Markarian 501, located about 450 million light-years from Earth.</p>



<p>Liodakis and colleagues had two main ideas for how magnetic fields might accelerate Markarian 501’s jet. Particles could be boosted by magnetic reconnection, where magnetic field lines break, reform and connect with other nearby lines. The same process <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">accelerates plasma on the sun</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>). If that was the particle acceleration engine, the polarization of light should be the same along the jet in all wavelengths, from radio waves to X-rays.</p>



<p>Another option is a shock wave shooting particles down the jet. At the site of the shock, the magnetic fields suddenly switch from turbulent to ordered. That switch could send particles zooming away, like water through the nozzle of a hose. As the particles leave the shock site, turbulence should take over again. If a shock was responsible for the acceleration, short wavelength X-rays should be more polarized than longer wavelength optical and radio light, as measured by other telescopes.</p>

The inset illustrates how particles in the jet hit a shock wave (white) and get boosted to extreme speeds, emitting high-energy X-ray light. As they lose energy, the particles emit lower energy light in visible, infrared and radio wavelengths (purple and blue), and the jet becomes more turbulent.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119559">Pablo Garcia/MSFC/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s exactly what the researchers saw, Liodakis says. “We got a clear result,” he says, that favors the shock wave explanation.</p>



<p>There is still work to do to figure out the details of how the particles flow, says astrophysicist James Webb of Florida International University in Miami. For one, it’s not clear what would produce the shock. But “this is a step in the right direction,” he says. “It’s like opening a new window and looking at the object freshly, and we now see things we hadn’t seen before. It’s very exciting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2022/11/23/eeg-microstates-functional-significance-and-short-term-test-retest-reliability.html">EEG Microstates: Functional Significance and Short-Term Test-Retest Reliability</a></h4>

              
                <p>This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper &quot;EEG Microstates: Functional Significance and Short-Term Test-Retest Reliability&quot; and his related work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>EEG microstates, reflecting discrete topographical organization of the EEG
signal power, may have clinical relevance; however, their functional
significance and test-retest reliability remain unclear. To investigate the
functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes and their
pairwise transitions, and to establish their within-session test-retest
reliability, we recorded 36-channel EEGs in 20 healthy volunteers during three
eyes-closed conditions: mind-wandering, verbalization (silently repeating the
word 'square' every 2 s), and visualization (visualizing a square every 2 s).
Each condition lasted 3 min and the sequence of three conditions was repeated
four times (two runs of two sequence repetitions). The participants' alertness
and their sense of effort during the experiment were rated using
visual-analogue scales. The EEG data were 2textendash 20 Hz bandpassfiltered
and analysed into the four canonical microstate classes: A, B, C, and D. EEG
microstate classes C and D were persistently more dominant than classes A and B
in all conditions. Of the first-order microstate param- eters, average
microstate duration was most reliable. The duration of class D microstate was
longer during mindwandering (106.8 ms) than verbalization (102.2 ms) or
visualization (99.8 ms), with a concomitantly higher coverage (36.4% vs.
34.7% and 35.2%), but otherwise there was no clear association of the four
microstate classes to particular mental states. The test-retest reliability was
higher at the beginning of each run, together with higher average alpha power
and subjective ratings of alertness. Only the transitions between classes C and
D (from C to D in particular) were significantly higher than what would be
expected from the respective micro- states' occurrences. The transition
probabilities, however, did not distinguish between conditions, and their
testretest reliability was overall lower than that of the first-order
parameters such as duration and coverage. Further studies are needed to
establish the functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes.
This might be more fruitfully achieved by looking at their complex syntax
beyond pairwise transitions. To ensure greater testretest reliability of
microstate parameters, study designs should allow for shorter experimental runs
with regular breaks, particularly when using EEG microstates as clinical
biomarkers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rats-bop-their-heads-to-the-beat-music">Rats can bop their heads to the beat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans aren’t the only animals known to move to a musical beat.</p>



<p>For instance, parrots do it, too. And now rats have been observed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo7019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bopping their heads</a> in time with the music of Mozart, Lady Gaga, Queen and others, researchers report on November 11 in <em>Science Advances</em>. </p>



<p>What’s more, the animals seem to respond to the same tempos that get humans’ feet tapping. The study could help reveal the evolutionary foundations of humans’ sense of rhythm.</p>





<p>“Some of us believe that music is very special to human culture. But I believe that its origin is somehow inherited from our progenitors,” says Hirokazu Takahashi, a mechanical engineer at the University of Tokyo, who studies how the brain works.</p>



<p>The ability to recognize the beat of a song and synchronize the movements of one’s body to it is known as beat synchronization. It’s a mystery why some species, like humans and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-bust-move-musical-beats">parrots</a>, have the innate ability and others do not (<em>SN: 4/30/09</em>).</p>



<p>For rats in the lab, Takahashi and his colleagues put on Mozart’s “Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major” (K. 448). The team sped up and slowed the tempo, as well as played it at its normal speed, observing the rats’ motions not only visually, but also with wireless accelerometers, which were surgically placed on the rats.</p>



<p>The team initially thought that body size might determine the tempos that triggered any head bopping. Humans tend to prefer foot tapping to music that’s between 120 to 140 beats per minute, but a small animal like a rat would probably need a quicker tempo to get that same reaction, the researchers hypothesized.</p>



<p>“There’s lots of reasons to think maybe [rats] would prefer faster rhythms. But that’s not what they found. And that’s intriguing,” says Aniruddh Patel, a psychologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., who was not involved in this research. He studies music cognition, the mental processes involved in perceiving and responding to music.</p>



<p>In the video recordings, the rats’ head bobbing was more pronounced when the sonata played at its usual tempo, around 132 beats per minute. The same was true for 20 people who listened through headphones with accelerometers.</p>





<p>For both humans and rats, the head bopping was consistent at about 120 to 140 bpm. When the music was played faster or slower, then there was no head bopping. That suggests that there is something fundamental about how the animal brain is tuned or wired to respond to rhythm, Takahashi says.</p>



<p>The team also played some of their favorite pop songs for the rats, including Lady Gaga&#8217;s &#8220;Born This Way&#8221; and Michael Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Beat It,&#8221; and saw a similar response.</p>

</div><figcaption>Researchers used motion capture cameras to track how rats move to a musical beat. The colored dots indicate markers that helped the cameras track the rodent’s subtle movements as it hears different musical pieces, including a Mozart piano sonata and Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way.”</figcaption></figure>



<p>While Patel agrees that rats seem to prefer beats that humans like, he is not convinced that the rats can synchronize to the beat like humans do.</p>



<p>“I think that that study actually raises more questions than answers in some sense,” Patel says. Humans and parrots show beat synchronicity through big, voluntary movements like head bobbing, dancing or foot tapping. The rats displayed very tiny movements that needed to be captured with special devices like a head-mounted accelerometer and motion capture technology. </p>



<p>The behavior was also more observable when the researchers lured the rats to stand on their back legs by putting their water bottle up high, compared with being on all fours.</p>



<p>“The fundamental nature of beat perception and synchronization is that you predict the timing of the beat and you move predictably” he says. “So, we land right on beat or a little ahead of it.” Since the rats’ movements are so tiny, it’s not clear if rats can predict the beats or if they’re just reacting to it.</p>



<p>Both Takahashi and Patel stress that this study does <em>not</em> show that rats like to dance to human music. “Music stimulus is very appealing to the brain,” Takahashi says. “But it is not evidence [that] they enjoy or they perceive music.”</p>



<p>Next, Takahashi is looking to see what other aspects of music we might share with rodents and other animals. “I&#8217;d like to maybe reveal how other properties, like melody and harmony, also relate to the dynamics of the brain.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-monkeys-remains-ancient-diplomacy-maya-mexico">A spider monkey’s remains tell a story of ancient diplomacy in the Americas</a></h4>

              
                <p>A sacrificed spider monkey is shedding new light on an ancient Mesoamerican relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The remains of a 1,700-year-old monkey found in the ancient city of Teotihuacan outside modern-day Mexico City suggest the primate was a diplomatic gift from the Maya. The find is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2212431119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the earliest evidence of a primate held in captivity in the Americas</a>, researchers report November 21 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unearthed in 2018 at the base of a pyramid in Teotihuacan, the monkey’s skeleton lay beside the corpses of other animals — including an eagle and several rattlesnakes — in an area of the city where visiting Maya elites may have resided.</p>





<p>Evidence of animal sacrifices, including of predators like jaguars, have been found in the city before. But “up to that point, we did not have any instances of sacrificed primates in Teotihuacan,” says Nawa Sugiyama, an anthropological archaeologist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>



<p>Chemical analysis of the spider monkey’s bones and teeth showed that the female had likely been captured in a humid environment at a young age sometime in the third century. The monkey then lived in captivity for a few years before meeting her end between the years 250 and 300.</p>



<p>The highlands around Mexico City are a long way from the natural habitat of spider monkeys (<em>Ateles geoffroy</em>), which require wet tropical forests to thrive. This fact, along with the presence of Maya murals and vessels, suggests to Sugiyama and her colleagues that the spider monkey was a gift from elite Mayas to the people of Teotihuacan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The find is an example of diplomatic relations between two cultures that sometimes had violent interactions. Maya hieroglyphs indicated that military forces from Teotihuacan invaded the Maya city of Tikal in 378, marking the start of a roughly 70-year period in which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lasers-lidar-mexican-pyramid-maya-teotihuacan-temple-feathered-serpent-tikal">Teotihuacan meddled in Maya politics</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>).</p>



<p>The “striking” discovery of the monkey shows that relationship between these two cultures far predates the invasion, says David Stuart, an archaeologist and epigraphist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“The war of 378 had a long history leading up to it,” he says. “The monkey is a really compelling illustration of this long relationship.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marsupials-complex-social-lives-evolution">Long considered loners, many marsupials may have complex social lives</a></h4>

              
                <p>Marsupials may have richer social lives than previously thought.</p>



<p>Generally considered loners, the pouched animals have <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide diversity of social relationships</a> that have gone unrecognized, a new analysis published October 26 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em> suggests. The findings could have implications for how scientists think about the lifestyles of early mammals.</p>



<p>“These findings are helpful to move us away from a linear thinking that used to exist in some parts of evolutionary theory, that species develop from supposedly simple into more complex forms,” says Dieter Lukas, an evolutionary ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who was not involved with the study.</p>





<p>Mammals run the gamut of social organization systems, ranging from loose, ephemeral interactions like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jaguars-brazil-wetland-huge-numbers-fish-hunt-play">aggregations of jaguars</a> in the South American wetlands to the antlike subterranean societies of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/naked-mole-rats-colonies-territory-pups">naked mole-rats</a> (<em>SN: 10/13/21</em>; <em>SN: 10/20/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But marsupials — a subgroup of mammals that give birth to relatively underdeveloped young reared in pouches — have traditionally been considered largely solitary. Some kangaroo species were known to form transient or permanent groups of dozens of individuals. But among marsupials, long-term bonds between males and females were thought rare and there were no known examples of group members cooperating to raise young. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1238677" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous work</a> on patterns of mammalian social evolution regarded about 90 percent of examined marsupial species to be solitary.</p>



<p>“If you look at other [studies] about some specific species, you will see [the researchers] tend to assume that the marsupials are solitary,” says Jingyu Qiu, a behavioral ecologist at CNRS in Strasbourg, France.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Sorting social lives</h4>



<p>Qiu and her colleagues developed a database of field studies that illuminated marsupial social organization, taking into account how populations vary within a species and delving into the evolutionary history of marsupial social lives. The researchers compiled data from 120 studies on 149 populations of 65 marsupial species, categorizing each population as solitary, living in pairs — such as one male and one female — or falling into four kinds of group living, including one male and multiple females (or vice versa), multiple males and females, or single sex groups.</p>



<p>While 19 species, or 31 percent of those studied, appear to go strictly solo, nearly half of the species always live in pairs or groups. The team also found lots of variation within species; 27 of the 65 species — more than 40 percent — fell into multiple social organization classifications.</p>





<p>When the researchers looked at this social variation against climatic conditions in Australia, they found that social variability was more common in drier environments with less predictable rainfall. It’s possible that being able to switch between solitary and group living acts as a buffer against resource unpredictability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers’ focus on social flexibility “highlights that there is nothing simple even about a supposedly solitary species,” Lukas says.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Implications for the earliest mammals</h4>



<p>Qiu and her colleagues also ran computer analyses comparing the evolutionary relationships of the marsupials with how they form social relationships. This let the team predict the social organization of the earliest marsupials, which split from placental mammals about 160 million years ago. Because modern marsupials have been considered solitary, the marsupial ancestors — and the earliest mammals on the whole — have generally been assumed to be solitary as well.</p>



<p>The team found that solitary was the most likely social category of the ancestral marsupials, a 35 percent probability. But Qiu points out that the varied combinations where pair and group living are possible options make up the other 65 percent. So “it is more likely that the ancestor was also non-solitary,” she says. The findings also give insights into the range of possible lifestyles experienced by the earliest mammals, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Robert Voss, a mammalogist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, questions the analyses’ insights about a potentially social ancestral marsupial. The uncertainty about the solitary alternative, he says, is largely due to the researchers’ benchmarks for what does and what doesn’t constitute social behavior — thresholds that Voss views as too permissive. For example, Voss disagrees with the team’s characterization of opossum social organization.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Anecdotal observations of [members of the same species] occasionally denning together is not compelling evidence for social behavior,” says Voss. &#8220;None of the cited studies suggest that opossums are anything other than solitary.”</p>



<p>Future work, Qiu says, will involve gathering data on a larger subset of mammals outside of marsupials to get a clearer picture of how social traits have evolved among mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-improve-urinal-nautilus-shell">How physics can improve the urinal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Restroom visitors can expect cleaner knees and tidier floors, if they happen to use a new urinal inspired by curves in nature.</p>



<p>The key to making <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD22/Session/U12.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a splashless urinal</a> is ensuring that a person’s pee stream hits the porcelain at a shallow angle no matter where it is aimed, researchers report November 22 at the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in Indianapolis. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“For a small enough angle, there is no splash,” says mechanical engineer Zhao Pan of the University of Waterloo in Canada. Pan calls the angle where splashing ceases “the critical angle.” Keeping the angle that a fluid strikes the surface at the critical angle or lower prevents the splash.</p>





<p>Pan and colleagues’ design — a tall, narrow urinal with a curving inner surface — employs the same geometry as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-shell-spirals">nautilus shell</a> (<em>SN: 4/1/05</em>). “There’s a smooth flow across the surface,” says Waterloo mechanical engineering student Kaveeshan Thurairajah, which prevents droplets from flying out.</p>



<p>In experiments involving dyed fluids sprayed into conventional urinals, the team found significant splash that, in the real world, would have ended up on a person’s legs and feet and on the floor nearby. When the researchers repeated the experiments with prototypes of the new design and inspected the surrounding surfaces, “I couldn’t find even a single droplet,” Thurairajah says.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether people using the new urinals will still somehow find a way to make a mess. To tell how well the urinals work in eventual real-world tests, Pan says, “just look at the floor.”</p>

                <p>We’ve never seen images of space as astounding as those from the James Webb Space Telescope, which shared its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first cosmic vistas in July</a>. The pictures have left us dazzled, awestruck and excited for more. They also inspired us to reflect on the top space images past and present. These images have moved us because of their drama, beauty or significance. Here’s how eight <em>Science News</em> staffers answered the question: What’s your favorite space image of all time?</p>



<h4>Apollo 8 Earthrise, taken in 1968</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/lisa-grossman">Lisa Grossman</a>, astronomy writer, chose Apollo 8’s Earthrise as her top space image. She says: The you-are-there, sci-fi-but-it’s-real feeling of seeing Earth over the edge of the moon gets my imagination going. And something about having the surface of the moon in the image gives me deep chills. I can imagine my own feet in those gray craters, my own eyes looking back at my own Earth. It’s wild. It’s eerie. I love it.</p>



<p>I feel similarly about the selfie images from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">the Mars rovers</a>; here’s NASA’s Curiosity rover at Mont Mercou in 2021. </p>

<p>You can see the rover and the landscape behind it. That’s our robotic avatar on that planet, rolling around doing our work. Though I’m lukewarm about sending people to do extraterrestrial exploration – I think the risks outweigh the scientific benefits – I have always been a sucker for imagining living on another world. Or at least visiting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/nikk-ogasa">Nikk Ogasa</a>, staff writer for physical sciences, says: There are so many awe-inspiring space images out there, but my favorite from this year was the <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Webb Space Telescope&#8217;s</a> heavenly shot of Neptune. It is stunning. The image captures the planet’s near-infrared glow in unprecedented detail. Not only can you see the glorious rings, but you can also pick out high-flying methane clouds as bright streaks. It blows my mind that we can see clouds on another world that is billions of miles away.</p>

<p>Two members of our team selected the Hubble Space Telescope’s second view of the Pillars of Creation, taken in 2014, as their top space image.</p>



<p>Design director <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/erin-otwell">Erin Otwell</a> says: My top space image is the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula. It’s my choice because of the awe-inspiring details and the painterly quality of the composition. To me, this image sums up the feeling of studying the cosmos and of creation itself. The towers of gas and dust where new stars are being born compose an almost solid-looking figure. It looks more like a hand than pillars. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/maria-temming">Maria Temming</a>, assistant editor at <em>Science News Explores</em>, says: I know that claiming the Pillars of Creation as my favorite space image is like saying Starbucks is my favorite coffee. But I don’t care! I love it. I have something of a sentimental attachment to this vista, since it was on the cover of the Great Courses intro to astronomy DVD set that first sparked my interest in space science.</p>

<p>The iconic, candy-colored images of the pillars in visible light are not the only versions that Hubble has captured. In 2014, the space telescope also took a ghostly picture of the scene in infrared light (above). Light at infrared wavelengths shines through the pillars’ gas and dust, revealing the baby stars swaddled inside these clouds.</p>



<h4>Thomas Digges’ view of the universe, published in 1576</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/tom-siegfried">Tom Siegfried</a>, contributing correspondent, chose this diagram as his favorite space image. He says: When Copernicus displaced the Earth from the center of the universe, he pictured the stars as occupying a sphere surrounding the planets that orbited on smaller spheres surrounding the sun. But Thomas Digges, an English astronomer who defended Copernicus, believed the stars extended far beyond the solar system. </p>



<p>In this image, published in 1576, Digges depicted numerous stars beyond the spheres of the planets, suggesting that the universe was “garnished with lights innumerable and reaching up in spherical altitude without end.” With these words Digges was the first follower of Copernicus to suggest that the universe encompassed an infinite expanse of space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/helen-thompson">Helen Thompson</a>, associate digital editor, says: Is it extremely blurry? Yes.

<h4>Gravitational lensing of quasar 2M1310-1714, captured in 2021</h4>

Treu</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/elizabeth-quill">Elizabeth Quill</a>, special projects editor, says: Within the ring of light at the center of this image are a pair of distant galaxies and a much more distant quasar behind them. The mass of the galactic duo is warping the fabric of spacetime, bending and magnifying the quasar’s light to form what are four separate images of the quasar, each sitting around the ring. It’s a visually powerful example of a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, which was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity</a> before it was ever observed. </p>



<p>My top space image wows me every time. How incredible that the universe works this way. How incredible that the human mind, a motley product of the universe, could foresee it. And not only foresee it; today’s scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/using-general-relativity-magnify-cosmos">use gravitational lensing as a tool</a> to study otherwise inaccessible regions of space. It’s both humbling and empowering.</p>



<h4>Pale Blue Dot, taken in 1990</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/christopher-crockett">Christopher Crockett</a>, associate news editor, says: My favorite space image of all time isn’t of a colorful nebula, or a glittering galaxy, or even a certain supermassive black hole. It’s a single dot, seemingly ensconced in a shaft of light.</p>



<p>After completing its tour of the solar system in 1990, <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Voyager 1</a> looked back and took a series of parting images – a “family portrait,” it was called – of several planets orbiting our sun. One of the images, which came to be known as <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the “pale blue dot” photo</a>, captured Earth as seen from roughly 6 billion kilometers away — the most distant image of home anyone has ever taken.</p>





<p>The image, updated with modern image-processing software and re-released in 2020 (above), remains a reminder of why we explore the universe. Yes, we want to better understand how space and time, stars and planets, galaxies and superclusters work, because we’re curious. But all those questions ultimately come back to trying to understand where we come from and how we fit into all that surrounds us. </p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/top-10-science-popularizers-all-time">Carl Sagan</a> emphasized, nothing better captures just how tiny we are in the grand scheme of things than seeing our entire planet reduced to a mere speck of light. </p>



<p>When I used to give public talks about astronomy, I almost always closed with this image. And I would usually read from Sagan’s reflections on it: </p>



<p>“Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.… on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.… There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on Monday, November 21, 2022</p>



<p>San Francisco-&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unam.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Universidad Nacional Autonoma Mexico</a>&nbsp;(UNAM) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://plos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Public Library of Science</a>&nbsp;(PLOS) today announced a one-year agreement,&nbsp;brokered by <a href="https://www.accucoms.com/">Accucoms</a> (PLOS&rsquo; regional representative),that will allow UNAM researchers to publish in&nbsp;<em>PLOS ONE</em> and other select PLOS journals<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> without incurring article processing charges (APC). <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-iii-flat-fees/">Flat fee agreements</a> and PLOS&rsquo; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-our-progress-to-date/">other models</a> shift publishing costs from authors to research institutions based on prior publishing history and anticipated future growth with PLOS. The agreement with UNAM starts on January 1, 2023.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to be collaborating with UNAM, our first flat fee institution in Mexico, which furthers our global outreach that will continue on through Latin America,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the largest research institution in Mexico, UNAM is uniquely well-positioned to demonstrate the benefits of Open Access publishing and Open Research practices.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Dr Susana Lopez Charreton, a virology researcher from the Biotechnology Institute of the UNAM, comments, &ldquo;This agreement is great news for UNAM researchers as it helps to bring their findings to a wider audience in excellent OA journals. It is not uncommon to resort to publishing our work in other, less prestigious journals due to APC payments that are often too high for the budgets we have. The opportunity to publish in the PLOS family will greatly benefit our research.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Dr. Alejandro Zentella-Dehesa, a cancer cell biologist and principal investigator of the department of Genomic Medicine and Environmental Toxicology of the Institute for Biomedical Research of the Autonomous National University of Mexico (UNAM), said &ldquo;Incorporation of UNAM to this agreement with PLOS will help a lot to communicate the results generated in original research as the final step of the academic activity of university researchers. UNAM is one of the most prominent and productive academic institutions in Latin America with an active and significant number of publications in all fields of scientific and humanistic research. However, publication of high-quality manuscripts in international journals with demanding peer review committees is frequently hampered by a combination of high publication fees and budget limitations. This agreement between UNAM and PLOS represents a valuable opportunity for UNAM researchers to publish high quality results in journals from this prestigious editorial group, free from budget limitations. All this will contribute to make knowledge generated at UNAM available to the international community.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It is exciting to see and be part of the early developments towards OA publishing agreements in Latin America, and to work closely with UNAM as a pioneer institution in the region in this aspect. I&rsquo;m happy to have been able to facilitate conversations between PLOS and UNAM to reach this important and unprecedented agreement, that will undoubtedly serve as an example for many other institutions in Mexico and Latin America in the years to come,&rdquo; said Anouk Snijders, Commercial Manager Latin America at Accucoms.</p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; Flat Fee model enables APC-free publishing with many of PLOS&rsquo; titles, which creates efficiency and reduces administrative overhead for managing gold APC funds. UNAM and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate Open Access publishing agreements.</p>



<p>UNAM joins a growing list of institutions to sign agreements with PLOS. Others include the <a href="https://consortium.ch/?lang=en">Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries</a> (CSAL), the <a href="https://btaa.org/">Big Ten Academic Alliance</a>, the University of California system, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester), <a href="http://nerl.org/">&nbsp;NorthEast Research Libraries</a> (NERL) and the <a href="https://www.crl.edu/">Center for Research Libraries</a>, the Canadian Research Knowledge Network <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a> to support their researchers through publishing deals with PLOS.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> last year honored PLOS as the co-winner for Innovation in Publishing for its Community Action Publishing model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/device-electric-field-scare-sharks-fishing-hooks">These devices use an electric field to scare sharks from fishing hooks</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new gadget takes advantage of sharks’ sixth sense to send the fish scurrying away from deadly hooks.</p>



<p>Sharks, rays and their relatives can detect tiny electric fields, thanks to bulbous organs concentrated near their heads called ampullae of Lorenzini. So researchers developed SharkGuard, a cylindrical device that attaches to fishing lines just above the hook and emits a pulsing, short-range electric field. The <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01427-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">device successfully deters sharks</a> and rays, probably by temporarily overwhelming their sensory system, the scientists report November 21 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>While many people are afraid of sharks, the fear makes more sense the other way around; numerous shark species are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-ocean-fish-population-recovery-extinction">at risk of extinction</a>, largely due to human activities (<em>SN: 11/10/22</em>).</p>



<p>One major problem facing sharks and rays is bycatch, where the creatures get accidentally snagged by fishermen targeting other fish like tuna, says David Shiffman, a marine biologist and faculty research associate at Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>



<p>Whether sharks and rays would be repelled or attracted by the electric fields generated by SharkGuard devices was an open question. The animals use their extra sense when hunting to detect the small electrical fields given off by prey. So marine biologist Rob Enever of Fishtek Marine, a conservation engineering company&nbsp;in Dartington, England, and his colleagues sent out two fishing vessels in the summer of 2021 — both outfitted with some normal hooks and some hooks with SharkGuard — and had them fish for tuna.</p>



<p>In short, the sharks wanted nothing to do with the SharkGuard gadgets. Video reveals blue sharks approaching a hook with SharkGuard and veering away with no apparent harm. When encountering an unadorned hook, sharks took the bait, becoming bycatch.</p>

</div><figcaption>Sharks and their relatives can detect electric fields using organs in the skin called ampullae of Lorenzini. So researchers tested whether attaching a SharkGuard device, which emits a pulse of electricity every two seconds, to a fishing line just above the hook could deter a shark. The results, showing a shark taking the bait of a normal hook but other sharks veering away from hooks with the device, could hold promise for preventing millions of sharks from becoming bycatch.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hooks with the electric repellant reduced catch rates of blue sharks (<em>Prionace glauca</em>) by 91 percent compared with standard hooks, dropping from an average of 6.1 blue sharks caught per 1,000 hooks to 0.5 sharks. And 71 percent fewer pelagic stingrays (<em>Pteroplatytrygon violacea</em>) were caught using SharkGuard hooks, going from seven captured rays per 1,000 hooks on average to two rays.</p>



<p>A typical fishing boat like those used in the study has approximately 10,000 hooks. So a boat whose entire set of hooks were outfitted with SharkGuard would go from catching about 61 blue sharks to 5, and 70 pelagic rays to 20.</p>





<p>When you scale those numbers up to the millions of sharks and rays that are accidentally caught in longline fisheries every year, Enever says, “you’re going to have massive recovery of these pelagic shark populations.”</p>



<p>“It’s definitely a notable and significant effect,” says Shiffman, who was not involved with the study. “If [the devices] went into effect across the fishing fleet that interacts with blue sharks, it would certainly be good news for [them].”</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean that SharkGuard is ready to be rolled out. Tuna catch rates were unseasonably low across the board in this study, which made it impossible to determine yet whether tuna are also bothered by the device. If they are, it wouldn’t make sense for fishermen to use the device in its current form.</p>



<p>The team is also working to make SharkGuard smaller, cheaper and as easy to manage as possible, so that fishermen can “fit and forget” it. For example, the current battery, which needs to be changed every couple of weeks, will be swapped for one that can be induction charged while the fishing line is not in use, “like a toothbrush, basically,” Enever says.</p>



<p>Shiffman would like to see SharkGuard tested in different environments and on other types of sharks. “There are a lot of shark species that are caught as bycatch on these longlines,” he says.</p>



<p>And while this invention seems effective so far, no technology will serve as a silver bullet for shark conservation. “Fixing this problem of bycatch is going to require a lot of different solutions working in concert,” Shiffman says.</p>



<p>The need for solutions is urgent. “We’re at a situation now where many of our pelagic species are either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable,” Enever says. But the new findings are “a real story of ocean optimism,” he says. They show that “there’s people out there … trying to resolve these things. There’s hope for the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollution-weakens-lungs-immune-defenses">Pollution mucks up the lungs’ immune defenses over time</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lungs’ immune defenses can wane with age, leaving older adults more susceptible to lung damage and severe bouts of respiratory infections. New research reveals one reason why this might happen: Inhaled particulate matter from pollution <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02073-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gunks up the works over time</a>, weakening the lungs’ immune system, researchers report online November 21 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Air pollution is a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30505-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major cause of disease and early death</a> worldwide and disproportionately <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-neighborhoods-40-years-worst-air-quality-pollution">impacts poor and marginalized communities</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/20</em>). Particulate matter — a type of pollution emitted from vehicle exhaust, power plants, wildfires and other sources — &nbsp;has been tied to health harms including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/list-diseases-linked-air-pollution-growing">respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases</a> (<em>SN: 9/19/17</em>).</p>





<p>In the new study, researchers from Columbia University analyzed lung immune tissue from 84 organ donors, ranging in age from 11 to 93 years old. The donors were nonsmokers or had no history of heavy smoking. With age, the lungs’ lymph nodes — which filter foreign substances and contain immune cells — became loaded with particulate matter, turning them a deep onyx, the research team found.</p>



<p>“If the [lymph nodes] build up with so much material, then they can’t do their job,” says Elizabeth Kovacs, a cell biologist who studies inflammation and injury at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.</p>



<p>The lymph nodes are home to an array of immune cells, including macrophages. These cellular Pac-Mans gobble up pathogens and other debris, including the particulate matter. Filled with the pollutant, the macrophages’ production of cytokines, proteins the cells secrete to activate other immune cells, decreased. The cells also showed signs of having a diminished capacity for more gobbling.</p>



<p>The new study indicates that older people have accumulated so much debris, “they may not be able to accumulate more,” impairing their ability to deal with inhaled material, says Kovacs, who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Pollution “is an ongoing and growing threat to the health and livelihood of the world’s population,” the research team writes. Their work finds that threat includes “a chronic and ubiquitous impact” on respiratory immunity with age.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-weird-symptoms-tongue-toe-virus">Got a weird COVID-19 symptom? You’re not alone</a></h4>

              
                <p>As we head into our third pandemic winter, most people are all too familiar with the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> signs of COVID-19</a>. The disease wears many different faces and can show up as chills, cough, difficulty breathing or other troublesome jumbles of symptoms. But sometimes, this illness can look positively peculiar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On rare occasions, SARS-CoV-2 rears its head in body parts not typically touched by respiratory viruses. From head to COVID toe, doctors have seen a bevy of bizarre cases. Patchy tongues, puffy digits, hair loss — such issues can be worrisome for patients, says Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases physician at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>





<p>But the outlook doesn’t have to be. That’s because such symptoms can end up going away on their own, says Chin-Hong, who has treated hundreds of people with COVID-19.</p>



<p>No one knows exactly how often <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/infection/covid-tongue#causes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID tongue</a>, <a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/coronavirus/covid-toes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID toe</a>, <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/is-covid-eye-thing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID eye</a> or other rare conditions occur — and it’s not always clear that COVID-19 is the actual culprit. Still, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-pandemic-long-term-imprint-health">sheer scale of coronavirus infections</a> means that SARS-CoV-2 has had many chances to show its stuff (<em>SN: 9/8/22</em>). The United States is now closing in on<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 98 million confirmed cases</a>. Such a staggering case count means that “statistically speaking, you’re going to find people with more and more weird things,” Chin-Hong says.</p>

<p>Doctors rely on medical case reports for leads on potential treatments and hints about how long symptoms may last. Even just knowing that someone else has had splotchy mouth sores or tender toes can be helpful, Chin-Hong says. That lets him tell his patients, “You’re not the only one,” he says. “That means a lot to a lot of people.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internal medicine doctor Saira Chaughtai published one such study in October in the <em>Journal of Medical Case Reports</em> after one of her primary care patients came in with a symptom Chaughtai had never seen. Ten days after testing positive for COVID-19, the patient’s <a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-022-03519-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tongue began to swell</a>, eventually erupting in white-ringed lesions.</p>



<p>Certain spots looked “denuded,” says Chaughtai, of Hackensack Meridian Health in Neptune, N.J. It was as if some of the tongue’s surface bumps had been sandpapered away. The patient wasn’t someone doctors would typically consider vulnerable, either. She was 30 years old, fit and healthy.</p>



<p>“I was like, ‘Oh my god, COVID can do anything,’” Chaughtai remembers thinking.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Oral sores can look different among patients. Chin-Hong has seen people with tongues coated white, as if they’d chewed a mouthful of tortilla chips. For Chaughtai’s patient, COVID tongue felt sensitive and irritated, with flare-ups that burned. Chaughtai wasn’t sure how to treat it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She searched the scientific literature and prescribed an assortment of mouthwashes, which helped. But six months in, the patient’s tongue hadn’t fully healed. So Chaughtai got creative. She teamed up with a sports medicine doctor, who beamed low-level laser light at the patient’s tongue. He had previously used this photobiomodulation therapy to treat muscle injuries.</p>



<p>Laser light therapy makes blood vessels dilate, enhancing blood flow to treated areas, which could promote healing, Chaughtai says. It seemed to work for her patient. The tongue lesions began to heal and flare-ups subsided. The woman still occasionally feels some tongue sensitivity when stressed, but never as bad as her initial outbreak.</p>



<h4>The effects of COVID toe</h4>



<p>About 1,300 kilometers west, a podiatrist in Crown Point, Ind., also dilated a patient’s blood vessels to treat a curious coronavirus condition: COVID toe. After infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients’ fingers and toes can plump up, sometimes painfully, and turn pink or reddish purple.</p>



<p>“We were seeing cases of these lesions that look like chilblains, which is something you get when you’re exposed to cold weather,” says Michael Nirenberg of Friendly Foot Care. But his patients hadn’t been in the cold — they’d been exposed to the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nirenberg has seen as many as 40 people with the symptom, which he’s found tends to clear up in a month or two. But one of his patients, a 59-year-old man, just couldn’t kick COVID toe. It ultimately lingered for nearly 670 days — the longest documented case Nirenberg has seen. “The term we used was<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cup.14240" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> long COVID toe</a>,” he says. Nirenberg and colleagues reported the case this spring in the <em>Journal of Cutaneous Pathology</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Nirenberg prescribed daily application of a nitroglycerin ointment to boost blood flow to the toes. That may have helped, Nirenberg says, “but I don’t know if time also did the trick.” After 22 months, the condition may have finally resolved on its own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The number of COVID toes Nirenberg encounters these days has gone down, but he’s still seeing people come in with the condition. And though Chaughtai has not treated another case of COVID tongue, a man recently e-mailed her saying that he had suffered from a similar affliction for two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UCSF’s Chin-Hong says he thinks it’s important for people to know that COVID-19 can cause such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-why-covid-19-hits-differently">a variety of symptoms</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/22</em>). “We can’t really predict who’s going to get what,” he says. But in his experience, strange symptoms have tended to crop up more often in people who haven’t been vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such symptoms may not be as serious as COVID-affected hearts or lungs, but they can certainly look scary, Chin-Hong says. “If this is a reason why some people might get vaccinated,” he says, “I think that would be great.”</p>

<h4>Tell us a bit about yourself</h4>
<p>I am a public health specialist and presently the Director of International Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR), Delhi. I have a rich experience in public health and I am particularly interested in implementation of epidemiological and clinical research based projects centered around Maternal and Child health with great relevance to national policies and programmes.</p>
<p>My goal is to mentor students and young professionals who can be the change agents in future &#8211; those who can see through problems directly or indirectly impacting health, explore them scientifically, and engage in advocacy. I seek to nurture researchers and bring people together who could be effective linkages between disciplines, generate synergy between research and programs and promote interdisciplinary research in the country.</p>
<h4> How does your work relate to the SDGs? Which SDGs specifically?</h4>
<p>Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality. It contributes to low birth-weight infants (birth weight less than 2500 grams), who are prone to deaths and diseases while they are young. Such babies are prone to chronic health problems such as diabetes and heart disease later in life.</p>
<p>Target 2.2 of SDG states that by 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons. The WHO global targets call for a 50% reduction in anaemia in women of reproductive age by 2025 relative to 2010 prevalence. Anaemia affects more than 50% of pregnant women in India.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key modalities towards reduction of prevalence of anemia include accurate diagnosis and institution of proper treatment. Several modalities for diagnosis and treatment of anaemia exist. For instance, oral iron has been a part of national program in India for decades with no major impact. Parenteral iron came to the aid of practitioners who were looking for a viable alternative for management of anaemia in pregnancy. However, it could not be included in the national programs due to paucity of reliable evidence on its effectiveness. This gap paved the way for designing and implementing a randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of parenteral iron sucrose compared to oral iron during pregnancy. The study was supported by WHO, India on the request of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This trial on more than 2,000 women in a pragmatic set up has been the largest ever trial on anemia in pregnancy, not only in India but in the world. The findings resulted in high impact publications that have been instrumental in bringing about an amendment in the national policy. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X19304279?via%3Dihub">1</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-abstract/35/10/1339/5999227?redirectedFrom=fulltext">2</a>, <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1447-0756.2012.02033.x">3</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13224-014-0588-2">4</a>)</p>
<p>For diagnosis of anemia, several invasive and non-invasive devices are in circulation. However, in the absence of robust evidence on efficacy and effectiveness, a country-level policy decision could not be taken. A need was felt to identify an accurate and cost-effective point-of-care device. We conducted Health Technology Assessments on such devices in community settings in collaboration with medical colleges, supported by Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health. The assessment included diagnostic accuracy when used by the grassroots-level functionaries in different weather conditions, operational issues, cost factors and scalability. The findings have helped in revising the national guidelines. (<a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05329-9">5</a>, <a href="https://htain.icmr.org.in/images/pdf/5_Policy_Brief_Hemoglobinometer.pdf">6</a>, <a href="https://jcp.bmj.com/content/69/2/164">7</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398422000367?via%3Dihub">8</a>)</p>
<p>These studies have been instrumental in guiding policies at national, regional and global levels.</p>
<h4>What challenges have you faced in your research? How did you work to overcome these?</h4>
<p>In busy medical colleges, getting hospital staff to get involved in research is quite difficult. Research staffs recruited specifically for the study were also simultaneously engaged in routine hospital work, thus sometimes trading-off with their roles in the study. It required a lot of motivation to support studies where regular hospital staff do not get any direct financial or tangible benefit. Needless to say, hospital staff play an important role in such type of clinical studies. Though their salary structure was guided by the Government norms, which was less than their expectations, the frequent dialogues and get-togethers with the core team throughout the study duration ensured that they remained motivated and committed towards their respective roles in the studies.</p>
<p>Follow up of patients was very critical in these studies but was not very easy as women in India normally visit their parents’ house during birth or give birth at home or in private set ups, rather than in hospitals where they can be monitored. Counselling by the research staff reduced the attrition rate to less than 5%, which otherwise could have been higher.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately it is sheer perseverance and grit that is needed to complete any research study successfully.</p></blockquote>
<p>We undertook the trial when ethical guidelines for conduct of clinical research, particularly trials, were undergoing extensive revisions in India. Frequent changes and lack of timely communications to the medical colleges for some period of time created communication gaps and misunderstandings at all levels. Amidst this confusion, the Ethics Committees also remained indecisive on certain matters, thereby extending the duration of the trial for several months with obvious ramifications in terms of smooth conduct of the study, retaining trained staff, staff attrition and exceeding overall budget of the study.</p>
<p>We were constrained by the budget and hence could not provide additional staff that the hospital wanted. Moreover, the contractual agreements were made for defined time periods and extensions were granted only after all official formalities were over. This led to several breaks in the contracts and we had to devise our internal arrangements to take care of the operational expenses.</p>
<p>Conducting a clinical trial spanning a period of ten years came with its own share of operational difficulties. I vividly remember the days when all the research staff came over demanding for a hike in their salaries. This was compounded by wastage of resources as the trial was halted and extended. Other challenges like study sites reporting about increased workload, the team falling short of meeting the timely deliverables to the Ministry, constraints in formalizing agreements with the state government who had generously supported the study, institutional pressure to recover the funds obtained from internal resources, etc. were encountered during this journey. There were differences of opinion within the team at multiple stages throughout the duration of the trial which, though resolved eventually, added to the many impediments which I had to face as a researcher.</p>
<p>Working on these projects has been a Herculean task in the true sense. However, the constant encouragement of Technical Advisory Group and senior faculty members of our Institute helped us to reach a successful conclusion. No wonder, this project has taught us many things which no textbook can ever match. Ultimately it is sheer perseverance and grit that is needed to complete any research study successfully.</p>
<h4>What does success in achieving the SDGs look like in your field of research?</h4>
<p>India is committed to address the problem of anemia. The flagship program of the Prime Minister, Anemia Mukt Bharat (Anemia Free India), is a testimony to this effect. With a great thrust emanating from political commitment and backed by strong evidence, the whole process of planning and programming for anaemia and its implementation has undergone radical changes. I am sure the momentum thus gained will go a long way in addressing the problem of anemia in the country.</p>
