              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gamma-ray-burst-breaks-rules-kilonova">A bizarre gamma-ray burst breaks the rules for these cosmic eruptions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astronomers have spotted a bright gamma-ray burst that upends previous theories of how these energetic cosmic eruptions occur.</p>



<p>For decades, astronomers thought that GRBs came in two flavors, long and short — that is, lasting longer than two seconds or winking out more quickly. Each type has been linked to different cosmic events. But about a year ago, two NASA space telescopes caught a short GRB in long GRB’s clothing: It lasted a long time but originated from a short GRB source.</p>





<p>“We had this black-and-white vision of the universe,” says astrophysicist Eleonora Troja of the Tor Vergata University of Rome. “This is the red flag that tells us, nope, it’s not. Surprise!”</p>



<p>This burst, called GRB 211211A, is the first that unambiguously breaks the binary, Troja and others report December 7 in five papers in <em>Nature</em> and <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>Prior to the discovery of this burst, astronomers mostly thought that there were just two ways to produce a GRB. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boat-brightest-gamma-ray-burst-supernova">collapse of a massive star</a> just before it explodes in a supernova could make a long gamma-ray burst, lasting more than two seconds (<em>SN: 10/28/22</em>). Or a pair of dense stellar corpses called neutron stars could collide, merge and form a new black hole, releasing a short gamma-ray burst of two seconds or less.</p>



<p>But there had been some outliers. A surprisingly short GRB in 2020 seemed to come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/short-gamma-ray-burst-star-core-collapse-explosion">a massive star’s implosion</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/21</em>). And some long-duration GRBs dating back to 2006 lacked a supernova after the fact, raising questions about their origins.</p>



<p>“We always knew there was an overlap,” says astrophysicist Chryssa Kouveliotou of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who wrote the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...413L.101K/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1993 paper that introduced the two GRB categories</a>, but was not involved in the new work. “There were some outliers which we did not know how to interpret.”</p>



<p>There’s no such mystery about GRB 211211A: The burst lasted more than 50 seconds and was clearly accompanied by a kilonova, the characteristic glow of new elements being forged after a neutron star smashup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="409" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120722_lg_strange-GRB_inline.jpg" alt="This shows the glow of a kilonova that followed the oddball gamma-ray burst called GRB 211211A, in images from the Gemini North telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope." class="wp-image-3119969" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120722_lg_strange-GRB_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120722_lg_strange-GRB_inline-637x383.jpg 637w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/120722_lg_strange-GRB_inline-309x186.jpg 309w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><span class="caption wp-caption-3119969">This shows the glow of a kilonova that followed the oddball gamma-ray burst called GRB 211211A, in images from the Gemini North telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119969">M. Zamani/International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA, NASA, ESA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Although we suspected it was possible that extended emission GRBs were mergers … this is the first confirmation,” says astrophysicist Benjamin Gompertz of the University of Birmingham in England, who describes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01819-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observations of the burst</a> in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. “It has the kilonova, which is the smoking gun.”</p>



<p>NASA’s Swift and Fermi space telescopes detected the explosion on December 11, 2021, in a galaxy about 1.1 billion light-years away. “We thought it was a run-of-the-mill long gamma-ray burst,” says astrophysicist Wen-fai Fong of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>





<p>It was relatively close by, as GRBs go. So that allowed Fong’s and Troja’s research groups to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05390-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independently</a> continue closely <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05327-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observing</a> the burst in great detail using telescopes on the ground, the teams report in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>As the weeks wore on and no supernova appeared, the researchers grew confused. Their observations revealed that whatever had made the GRB had also emitted much more optical and infrared light than is typical for the source of a long GRB.</p>



<p>After ruling out other explanations, Troja and colleagues compared the burst’s aftereffects with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">first kilonova ever observed in concert with ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). The match was nearly perfect. “That’s when many people got convinced we were talking about a kilonova,” she says.</p>



<p>In retrospect, it feels obvious that it was a kilonova, Troja says. But in the moment, it felt as impossible as seeing a lion in the Arctic. “It looks like a lion, it roars like a lion, but it shouldn’t be here, so it cannot be,” she says. “That’s exactly what we felt.”</p>



<p>Now the question is, what happened? Typically, merging neutron stars collapse into a black hole almost immediately. The gamma rays come from material that is superheated as it falls into the black hole, but the material is scant, and the black hole gobbles it up within two seconds. So how did GRB 211211A keep its light going for almost a minute?</p>



<p>It’s possible that the neutron stars first merged into a single, larger neutron star, which briefly resisted the pressure to collapse into a black hole. That has implications for the fundamental physics that describes how difficult it is to crush neutrons into a black hole, Gompertz says.</p>



<p>Another possibility is that a neutron star collided with a small black hole, about five times the mass of the sun, instead of another neutron star. And the process of the black hole eating the neutron star took longer.</p>



<p>Or it could have been something else entirely: a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05403-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neutron star merging with a white dwarf</a>, astrophysicist Bing Zhang of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and colleagues suggest in <em>Nature</em>. “We suggest a third type of progenitor, something very different from the previous two types,” he says.</p>



<p>White dwarfs are the remnants of smaller stars like the sun, and are not as dense or compact as neutron stars. A collision between a white dwarf and a neutron star could still produce a kilonova if the white dwarf is very heavy.</p>



<p>The resulting object could be a highly magnetized neutron star called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-spotted-colliding-neutron-stars-magnetar">magnetar</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). The magnetar could have continued pumping energy into gamma rays and other wavelengths of light, extending the life of the burst, Zhang says.</p>



<p>Whatever its origins, GRB 211211A is a big deal for physics. “It is important because we wanted to understand, what on Earth are these events?” Kouveliotou says.</p>



<p>Figuring out what caused it could illuminate how heavy elements in the universe form. And some previously seen long GRBs that scientists thought were from supernovas might actually be actually from mergers.</p>



<p>To learn more, scientists need to find more of these binary-busting GRBs, plus observations of gravitational waves at the same time. Trejo thinks they’ll be able to get that when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, comes back online in 2023.</p>



<p>“I hope that LIGO will produce some evidence,” Kouveliotou says. “Nature might be graceful and give us a couple of these events with gravitational wave counterparts, and maybe [help us] understand what’s going on.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2022-james-webb-space-telescope-images">In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope brought us new views of the cosmos</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">This year marked the end of a decades-long wait for astronomers. The James Webb Space Telescope is finally in action.</p>



<p>The telescope, which launched in December 2021, released its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">first science data in July</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/22, p. 30</em>) and immediately began surpassing astronomers’ expectations.</p>



<p>“We’ve realized that James Webb is 10 times more sensitive than we predicted” for some kinds of observations, says astronomer Sasha Hinkley of the University of Exeter in England. His team released in September the telescope’s first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">direct image of an exoplanet</a> (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 6</em>). He credits “the people who worked so hard to get this right, to launch something the size of a tennis court into space on a rocket and get this sensitive machinery to work perfectly. And I feel incredibly lucky to be the beneficiary of this.”</p>





<p>The telescope, also known as JWST, was designed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">to see further back into the history of the cosmos</a> than ever before (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 26</em>). It’s bigger and more sensitive than its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. And because it looks in much longer wavelengths of light, JWST can observe distant and veiled objects that were previously hidden.</p>



<p>JWST spent its first several months collecting “early-release” science data, observations that test the different ways the telescope can see. “It is a very, very new instrument,” says Lamiya Mowla, an astronomer at the University of Toronto. “It will take some time before we can characterize all the different observation modes of all four instruments that are on board.”</p>



<p>That need for testing plus the excitement has led to some confusion for astronomers in these heady early days. Data from the telescope had been in such high demand that the operators hadn’t yet calibrated all the detectors before releasing data. The JWST team is providing calibration information so researchers can properly analyze the data. “We knew calibration issues were going to happen,” Mowla says.</p>



<p>The raw numbers that scientists have pulled out of some of the initial images may end up being revised slightly. But the pictures themselves are real and reliable, even though it takes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-challenges-artists-see-infrared">some artistry</a> to translate the telescope’s infrared data into colorful visible light (<em>SN: 3/17/18, p. 4</em>).</p>



<p>The stunning photos that follow are a few of the early greatest hits from the shiny new observatory.</p>



<h4>Deep space</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1022" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_deep-space.jpg" alt="James Webb Space Telescope first deep field image with the image on the left taken with the telescope's MIRI instrument and the image on the right taken from the NIRCam" class="wp-image-3119900" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_deep-space.jpg 1500w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_deep-space-562x383.jpg 562w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_deep-space-660x450.jpg 660w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_deep-space-273x186.jpg 273w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_deep-space-768x523.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_deep-space-851x580.jpg 851w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_deep-space-1139x776.jpg 1139w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3119900">NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>JWST has captured the deepest views yet of the universe (above). Galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 (bluer galaxies) is 4.6 billion light-years from Earth. It acts as a giant cosmic lens, letting JWST zoom in on thousands of even more distant galaxies that shone 13 billion years ago (the redder, more stretched galaxies). The far-off galaxies look different in the mid-infrared light (above left) captured by the telescope’s MIRI instrument than they do in the near-infrared light (above right) captured by NIRCam. The first tracks dust; the second, starlight. Early galaxies have stars but very little dust.</p>



<h4>Rings around Neptune</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1022" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_neptune.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3119902" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_neptune.jpg 1500w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_neptune-562x383.jpg 562w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_neptune-660x450.jpg 660w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_neptune-273x186.jpg 273w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_neptune-768x523.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_neptune-851x580.jpg 851w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_neptune-1139x776.jpg 1139w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3119902">NASA, ESA, CSA, STSCI; IMAGE PROCESSING: JOSEPH DEPASQUALE/STSCI, NAOMI ROWE-GURNEY/NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>JWST was built to peer over vast cosmic distances, but it also provides new glimpses at our solar system neighbors. This <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptune-rings-new-image-james-webb-telescope">pic of Neptune</a> was the first close look at its delicate-looking rings in over 30 years (<em>SN: 11/5/22, p. 5</em>).</p>



<h4>Under pressure</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1022" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3119904" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure.jpg 1500w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-562x383.jpg 562w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-660x450.jpg 660w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-273x186.jpg 273w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-768x523.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-851x580.jpg 851w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/121722_jwst_under-pressure-1139x776.jpg 1139w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3119904">NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The rings in this astonishing image are not an optical illusion. They’re made of dust, and a new ring is added every eight years when the two stars in the center of the image come close to each other. One of the stars is a Wolf-Rayet star, which is in the final stages of its life and puffing out dust.

<p>With JWST’s unprecedented sensitivity, astronomers plan to compare the earliest galaxies with more modern galaxies to figure out how galaxies grow and evolve. This galactic smashup, whose main remnant is known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-cartwheel-galaxy-image">the Cartwheel galaxy</a>, shows a step in that epic process (<em>SN Online: 8/3/22</em>). The large central galaxy (right in the above composite) has been pierced through the middle by a smaller one that fled the scene (not in view). The Hubble Space Telescope previously snapped a visible light image of the scene (top half). But with its infrared eyes, JWST has revealed much more structure and complexity in the galaxy’s interior (bottom half).</p>

<p>The gas giant HIP 65426b was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">first exoplanet</a> to have its portrait taken by JWST&nbsp;(each inset shows the planet in a different wavelength of light; the star symbol shows the location of the planet’s parent star). This image, released by astronomer Sasha Hinkley and colleagues, doesn’t look like much compared with some of the other spectacular space vistas from JWST. But it will give clues to what the planet’s atmosphere is made of and shows the telescope’s potential for doing more of this sort of work on even smaller, rocky exoplanets (<em>SN: 9/24/22, p. 6</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brewing-yeast-ancestor-ireland-beer">The ancestor to modern brewing yeast has been found hiding in Ireland</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1516, the duchy of Bavaria in Germany imposed a law on its beer brewers meant to reserve ingredients like wheat and rye for the baking of bread. The decree restricted brewers to using only barley, hops, water and yeast to make their libations, and set the prices for beer depending on the time of year. The law inadvertently limited brewing to the winter, which favored a cold-tolerant yeast called <em>Saccharomyces pastorianus</em>, which brews lager, over the more common <em>S. cerevisiae, </em>which brews ale<em>.</em></p>



<p><em>S. pastorianus </em>is a hybrid, produced from the mating of <em>S. cerevisiae </em>with another yeast called <em>S. eubayanus</em>. Despite lager’s European origins, <em>S. eubayanus </em>hadn’t actually been found there and was only first discovered in 2011, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lagers-mystery-ingredient-found">in the Patagonia region of South America</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/11</em>). Now, thanks to a research project carried out by undergraduate students, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsyr/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/femsyr/foac053" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>S. eubayanus</em> has been found living in European soil</a> — fittingly, in the beer-loving nation of Ireland.</p>





<p>“Since the discovery of <em>S. eubayanus</em> [more than] 10 years ago, it’s been a fun puzzle putting together where the species is actually found,” says Quinn Langdon, a biologist at Stanford University, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>A leading theory is that <em>S. eubayanus</em> originated in Patagonia and then spread around the world, eventually mating with <em>S. cerevisiae </em>in European breweries to make <em>S. pastorianus</em>.</p>



<p>Geraldine Butler, a geneticist at University College Dublin and leader of the project, always thought that teaching genome-sequencing techniques by having students scour soils for yeast could turn up <em>S. eubayanus</em>. Still, she says, she couldn’t contain her excitement when she saw the first hint of the microbe. “I was sitting by the sequencer waiting for the results to come out,” she says.</p>



<p>One of Butler’s students, Stephen Allen, found two local strains of <em>S. eubayanus</em> hiding in plain sight on the Belfield campus of University College Dublin. The team has since gone back and found the yeast again, Butler says, suggesting that there is a stable population of the yeast living in the Irish soil.</p>



<p>The new discovery was published December 7 in <em>FEMS Yeast Research</em>.</p>



<p>Butler hopes this discovery will brew interest elsewhere in Europe to search for <em>S. eubayanus</em>, including in Bavaria, where lager brewing is thought to have first started. She is also looking for commercial partners to try making beer with the Irish strains.</p>



<p>Langdon isn’t confident that the new microbes will lead to tasty brews because there are other <em>S. eubayanus </em>strains that don’t grow well on maltose, the sugar that needs to be digested by yeasts during the brewing process. Still, Langdon says, “it’d be fun to brew with them.”</p>





<p>Whether the newly discovered Irish strains of <em>S. pastorianus</em>’ missing parent taste good or not, there’s no denying that their discovery helps solve a little piece of the puzzle of lager brewing’s origins. That 16th century shift from <em>S. cerevisiae</em> to <em>S. pastorianus</em> led to a global shift that continues to this day — more than 90 percent of beer sold worldwide today is lager.</p>



<p>Fungi are the “forgotten kingdom,” Langdon says, not getting as much attention as plants or animals, despite playing an outsize role in human history. “Yeasts are just single cells living in the soil, and they’re doing really important things.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ankylosaur-dinosaur-tail-club-bludgeon">Armored dinos may have used their tail clubs to bludgeon each other</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tanklike armored dinosaurs probably pummeled each other — not just predators — with huge, bony knobs attached to the ends of their tails. Thanks to new fossil findings, researchers are getting a clearer understanding of how these rugged plant eaters may have used their wicked weaponry.</p>



<p>Many dinosaurs known as ankylosaurids sported a heavy, potentially microwave-sized tail club. This natural sledgehammer has long been considered by both scientists and artists as a defensive weapon against predators, says Victoria Arbour, a paleontologist at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, Canada.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Fossil evidence for tail clubs’ targets was largely lacking, until Arbour and her colleagues chipped more rock away from the same skeleton they used to describe a new armored dinosaur, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dinosaur-resurrects-demon-ghostbusters"><em>Zuul crurivastator</em></a>, in 2017 <em>(SN: 6/12/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dinosaur had five broken spikes on its sides. The team&#8217;s statistical analyses showed the damaged spikes clustered in specific regions of the body. If a large carnivorous dinosaur made these injuries, says Arbour, they’d likely be more randomly distributed and include bite and scratch marks.&nbsp;</p>

White spikes don’t show this kind of damage. (Alphanumeric markers label parts of the fossil.) The pattern suggests injuries occurred at different points in time, consistent with repeated tail club clobbering in the same spot, researchers say.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119941">Danielle Dufault/© Royal Ontario Museum</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead, the injuries are <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more consistent with clubbing</a>, the researchers report December 7 in <em>Biology Letters.</em><br><br>Armored dinosaurs&#8217; tail clubs start out either absent or too tiny to mount a major defense, and they get proportionally larger with age. Similar growth patterns occur in some modern animal weaponry like antlers. It’s possible that tanklike dinosaurs sparred with each other for mates, food or territory much like male deer and giraffes do today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that tail could also be useful in a pinch. “Having a tail club you can swing around at the ankles of a two-legged predator is a pretty effective weapon,” says Arbour.</p>



<p>“Ankylosaurs are often portrayed as stupid, loner dinosaurs,” she adds. The findings “show that they probably had much more complex behaviors than we give them credit for.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wolves-parasite-pack-leader-toxoplasma-gondii">A parasite makes wolves more likely to become pack leaders</a></h4>

              
                <p>A parasite might be driving some wolves to lead or go solo.</p>



<p>Wolves in Yellowstone National Park infected with <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04122-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make more daring decisions</a> than their uninfected counterparts, researchers report November 24 in <em>Communications Biology</em>.&nbsp;The wolves’ enhanced risk-taking means they are more likely to leave their pack, or become leaders of their own.</p>



<p>“Those are two decisions that can really benefit wolves, or could cause wolves to die,” says Connor Meyer, a field biologist at the University of Montana in Missoula. The findings reveal a parasite’s potent ability to influence a wolf’s social fate.</p>



<p>Disease is often considered important for wildlife, mostly in the context of killing its host, Meyer says. “We have evidence now that just being infected with a certain parasite — <em>Toxoplasma</em> — can have pretty major implications for wolf behavior.”</p>

<p>Single-celled <em>T. gondii</em> has a track record of altering animal behavior. Its most important hosts are cats, which provide a breeding ground for the parasite in their small intestine. The parasite offspring hitch a ride on feline feces. Other animals then ingest the parasite, which then manipulates its new hosts’ behavior by tweaking certain hormones, making the hosts bolder or more aggressive. Infected mice, for example, can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parasite-makes-mice-unafraid-cats-may-quash-other-fears">fatally lose their fear of cats</a>, allowing the parasite to infect more hosts once the mice are consumed (<em>SN: 1/14/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Yellowstone National Park, many wolves are also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81192-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infected with <em>T. gondii</em></a>, recent research has shown.&nbsp;So Meyer and colleagues wondered if gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) in the park showed any parasite mind-bending of their own.</p>





<p>Wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995. Ongoing study of the park’s packs meant that the researchers had access to about 26 years’ worth of blood samples, behavioral observations and movement data for 229 of the park’s wolves.</p>



<p>The team screened the wolf blood for antibodies against <em>T. gondii</em> parasites, which reveal an infection. The researchers also noted which wolves left their pack — usually a family unit consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring — or became a pack leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both are high-stakes moves for a wolf, Meyer says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Infected wolves were 11 times as likely as noninfected wolves to disperse from their pack, the team found, and about 46 times as likely to eventually become leaders. The findings fit in with <em>T. gondii’</em>s apparent ability to boost boldness across a wide range of warm-blooded life.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The study fills a crucial gap in the <em>Toxoplasma</em> pool of knowledge, says Ajai Vyas, a neurobiologist at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>“Most of the earlier work has been done in the lab,” Vyas says. But there are limitations to that approach, especially for re-creating how animals experience the effects of the parasite in their natural environment. Such research has “become almost like studying whale swimming behavior in backyard pools; [it] does not work very well.”</p>



<p>Wolves’ enhanced boldness may even form a feedback loop, the team proposes. The researchers found that not only do cougars (<em>Puma concolor</em>) in the park carry the parasite, but wolves’ infection rates were highest when the animals’ ranges overlapped with the park’s densest aggregations of cougars. Infected wolf leaders may be more likely to bring pack members into riskier situations, including approaching cougar territories, making additional infections more likely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The feedback-loop idea is “very fascinating,” but more research is needed to confirm it, says Greg Milne, an epidemiologist at the Royal Veterinary College in London, who was not involved with the study. Such research may involve determining if infected wolves are more likely to migrate into an area with more cougars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think people are just starting to really appreciate that personality differences in animals are a major consideration in behavior,” says study coauthor Kira Cassidy, a wildlife biologist at the Yellowstone Wolf Project in Bozeman, Mont. “Now we add a parasite-impacting behavior to the list.”</p>



<p>Next, the team is interested in examining the long-term consequences of a <em>T. gondii</em> infection, and whether infected wolves make better leaders or dispersers than uninfected wolves.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It’s also not known how infection impacts survival and reproduction rates, Cassidy says. “Infection may very well be detrimental in some ways and advantageous in others.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780063097254" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pests</a><br><em>Bethany Brookshire</em><br><em>Ecco, $28.99</em></p>



<p>We spend so much time making sure wildlife stays away from us, whether that’s setting traps, building fences or putting out poisons. Sure, unwanted guests are annoying. But why do we consider some animals “pests”? It’s all about perspective, says science journalist Bethany Brookshire. “We can put poison out for rats and protest their use as laboratory animals. We can shoot deer in the fall and show their adorable offspring to our children in the spring,” she writes in her new book, <em>Pests: How Humans Create Animal Villains</em>.</p>





<p>Brookshire argues that we deem animals “pests” when we fear them (like snakes). Or when they thrive in a niche we unintentionally created for them (think rats in the New York subway). Or when they find a way to live in a habitat now dominated by humans (all those deer in the suburbs). Sometimes we demonize an animal if we feel like it’s threatening our ability to control the landscape (like coyotes that attack our livestock, pets and even children).</p>



<p>Through the lens of science, history, culture, religion, personal anecdotes and a big dose of humor, Brookshire breaks down how our perspective shapes our relationships with our animal neighbors. She also goes into the field — trailing rats, hunting pythons, taming feral cats, tracking drugged-up bears — to see firsthand how pests are treated.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Brookshire, a former staff writer for <em>Science News for Students</em> (now <em>Science News Explores</em>), about what we can learn from pests and how we can co­exist with them. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What inspired you to write this book?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> I wrote a news story that was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/how-house-mouse-tamed-itself">about mice living with humans</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/17</em>). [It was based on a study] showing that we’ve had house mice since we’ve had houses. I love the fact that humans have had these other animals taking advantage of the ecosystems that we create basically since we started living settled life. Every location that has humans has their “rat.” Sometimes that’s a rat, and sometimes it’s a pigeon or a cockatoo or a lizard or a horse. It’s not about what these animals are doing. Animals live in ecosystems that we create, and we hate animals that live too close.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What surprised you during your research?</strong></p>





<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> The reflexiveness of people’s responses [to pests]. People respond emotionally. When you make them pause and think about it, they go, “Oh wow, that doesn’t make any sense. I should not be caught trying to kill a raccoon with a sword.” But in the moment, you’re so wrapped up in the violation of what you see as your personal space.</p>



<p>The other thing is the extent to which our disdain of pests is wrapped up in social justice. A lot of times we see this hatred and disgust for animals that we see as “low class.” High-class people don’t have rats. And that’s really about social justice, about infrastructure and the ability of people to live in clean houses, store their food properly or even have a house at all.</p>



<p>Also, the way we deal with these animals often has vestiges of colonialism, as in the chapter on elephants. [In Kenya, European colonists] made people grow corn and sugarcane, which elephants love. Colonization created national park systems that assumed that humans had no place in wilderness, shoving out Indigenous pastoralists. Colonization created the market for poached ivory. And colonizing people assumed that Indigenous people did not like elephants or know their benefits. We are living with the consequences. Many modern efforts at elephant protection are spearheaded by Western people, and they assume the biggest issue with elephants is poaching and that Indigenous people don’t know what’s best for themselves or the elephants. In fact, human-elephant conflict [which includes elephant crop raids] is the far bigger problem, and Indigenous people have a long history of coexisting with elephants.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: In the book, you looked at many different cultures and included Indigenous voices.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> It’s important to realize there’s more than one way to look at the world. By learning from other cultures, it helps us understand our biases. It’s only when you get outside of your own beliefs that you realize that’s not just the way things are.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: That shows up when you write about the Karni Mata Temple in India, also known as the Temple of Rats. Temple rats are not treated as pests, but a rat in a house would be.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> That’s the result of context. And you see that in Western cultures all the time. People love squirrels. Well, they’re basically rats with better PR. Then you have people who have pet rats, who would probably scream if a sewer rat ran by.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Are there any animals that you consider a pest?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> No. The animal that I’ve probably come away with the most negative impression of is humans. It’s funny because we think we can extinct anything. And I love how these animals have gone: “Oh, poison? That’s cute.” “Oh, a trap? You’re funny.” We’ve tried to use electric fences on elephants [to stop them from eating crops]. And elephants are like, “Guess what? Ivory doesn’t conduct electricity.” Even if they don’t have tusks, elephants just pick up a log [to destroy the fence].</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Are you hoping to change people’s minds about pests? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Brookshire:</strong> I hope that they will ask why they respond to pests the way they do. Instead of just going, “This animal bothers me,” ask why, and does it make sense. I also hope it opens more curiosity about the animals around us. I learned from Indigenous groups just how much knowledge they have of the animals in their ecosystem. I hope more people learn. A world that you know a lot about is just a better world to live in.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/natural-gene-drive-invasive-rodents-extinction-island">A natural gene drive could steer invasive rodents on islands to extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the battle against the invasive house mouse on islands, scientists are using the rodent’s own genes against it.</p>



<p>With the right tweaks, introducing a few hundred genetically altered mice could <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2213308119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drive an island’s invasive mouse population to extinction</a> in about 25 years, researchers report in the Nov. 15 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The trick is adding the changes to a section of mouse DNA that gets inherited far more often than it should.</p>





<p>Scientists have been creating similar extra-inheritable genes — called gene drives — in the lab. The chunks are designed to get passed on to most or all of an animal’s offspring instead of the usual half, and make those offspring infertile in the bargain. Scientists have used gene drives to reduce populations of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-extermination-top-science-stories-2018-yir">mosquitoes</a> and fruit flies (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>).</p>



<p>But mammals are a different story. Scientists have previously synthesized a gene drive that gets passed on in mice about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-drive-mice-p">80 percent of the time</a> (<em>SN: 1/23/19</em>). But the drive isn’t strong enough to stop a population quickly.</p>



<p>Luckily, nature has it handled. A haplotype is a naturally occurring group of genes that gets passed on as a unit during replication. The genome of the house mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>) has a particular haplotype, called the <em>t </em>haplotype, that gets passed on to offspring more than 95 percent of the time, instead of the typical 50 percent.</p>



<p>This natural gene drive has benefits, says Anna Lindholm, a biologist at the University of Zurich who was not involved in the study. It “evolved naturally and continues to be present in the wild, and we have as yet not found resistance to it in wild populations,” she says. It’s also not found in species besides <em>M. musculus,</em> meaning it probably won’t spread to other noninvasive mice.</p>



<p>Molecular biologist Paul Thomas and his colleagues decided to target the <em>t</em> haplotype with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-inspires-new-tricks-edit-genes">the cut-and-paste molecular tool called CRISPR/Cas9</a> (<em>SN: 8/24/16</em>). They used CRISPR to insert the gene sequence for the CRISPR tool itself into the <em>t </em>haplotype. When a male mouse carrying the altered <em>t</em> haplotype mates with a female, the inserted genes for the CRISPR tool spring into action. It uses a special genetic guide to target and inactivate the gene for the hormone prolactin — rendering any baby female mice infertile.</p>



<p>The best part is that the natural <em>t </em>haplotype can also sterilize males, says Thomas, of the University of Adelaide in Australia. Males with two copies — homozygous males — won’t reproduce at all. </p>



<p>“If you could get a <em>t</em> to spread through a population, you could get homozygous males being sterile,” he says. “And with the addition of the CRISPR element on top of that, we get homozygous females that are also sterile.”</p>





<p>To find out how well the <em>t</em> haplotype mice do on an island where mice are wreaking havoc on biodiversity, the scientists used a computer simulation of an island with 200,000 mice. The team found that adding just 256 mice with the CRISPR-altered <em>t</em> haplotype could successfully drive the mouse population to zero in around 25 years. Even without CRISPR, adding mice with the normal <em>t </em>haplotype could tank the population in about 43 years.</p>



<p>But models aren’t mice. In a final test, Thomas and his colleagues made the model reality. The team altered the <em>t</em> haplotype in a small group of mice in the lab and used genetic tests to show that those mice would pass on their new genetics 95 percent of the time.</p>



<p>“This is a clever idea, to build on the <em>t</em> haplotype natural drive system and use CRISPR, not for spreading the construct, but for damaging genes necessary for female fertility,” Lindholm says. “This is a big advance in the development of new tools to control invasive mouse populations.”</p>



<p>The next step, Thomas says, will be to test the effects in real populations of mice in secure enclosures, to find out if the genetically tweaked <em>t </em>can stop mice from reproducing. The scientists also want to ensure that any engineered mice released into the wild have some safety mechanism in place, so other mice elsewhere remain unaffected. </p>



<p>The final version might target tiny mutations that only occur on one island where the pest population is isolated, Thomas suggests. If the mouse escaped onto the mainland, its altered genes would have no effect on the local mice. The scientists also want to consult with people living in the area, as officials did when genetically modified mosquitoes were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">released in Florida</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>Finally, he notes, 25 years is a long wait for some endangered island populations. “We would love to see CRISPR work faster,” he says. “It’s still a work in progress.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/12/escaideb-300x95-1-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>I attended during 24-26 November 2022 to the European Scientific Conference on Applied Infectious Disease Epidemiology (ESCAIDE), organized and hosted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm during 24 – 26 November 2022. The conference was conducted in a hybrid mode, where a total of 500 and 2,400 persons attended in-person and online, respectively.</p>
<p>Here I share my impressions from the conference:</p>
<p>The first important topic was about <strong>Ethics</strong>: Alena Buyx, president of the German Ethics Council discussed about ethical boundaries and reminded us of the importance of keeping ethics in mind for future pandemics. She referenced the famous Ethicist Ross Upshur who said “The lesson we have learned is that we do not like to learn lessons” as he described we had learned a lot from the previous outbreaks and pandemics. Also, we need to focus more on vulnerability and resilience (for example to protect elderly people early on). We need to be more tolerant of uncertainties: for epidemiologists, we deal with risks in different specialties, but the public does not know it; therefore we need to keep a sense of togetherness. In the future, we need to include ethics in the process of policymaking, and we need to have ethically responsible tools of preparedness while keeping the option for civil society to be involved in the response to pandemics, which was already shown in a study by Driesen et.al. in Germany [1].</p>
<p>The topic of the COVID-19 pandemic has complicated the responses to an already complex situation of the intersection between climate, conflicts and socioeconomic risks, in combination with rising food insecurity and displacement. Therefore the number of refugees is increasing and the funding to support them is decreasing. There is an emerging inequity in funding channeling to the global refugee situation. This will be a public health concern in the near future.</p>

<p>The topic of communication took a large part of the conference. The COVID19 pandemic moved very fast and therefore we need to invest more in communication with the public. The internet and social media made us realize that the so-called geographical borders are just political or “human-made” and the world has become as a single country. Also, we need to focus more on how we communicate scientific messages to the public. How do we make sure we are proactive in risk communication?, incidentally this topic was also reported by an international study by Cristea et.al. [2].</p>
<p>The topic of “One Health” was of importance as well, with emphasis on the power of working together as different disciplines. This will be a key element for the preparedness for the second pandemic and dealing with the consequences of climate change.</p>
<p>Finally, COVID19 has pushed different scientific methods to scale their work and to be innovative on how to work at a much faster pace. For example, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing and genome sequencing has increased by several folds post-COVID19.</p>
<p>Finally, I was lucky to interview Dr. Andrea Ammon, the director of ECDC who shared her take-home message from ESCAIDE to the world:</p>

                <p>An ancient hominid dubbed <em>Homo naledi</em> may have lit controlled fires in the pitch-dark chambers of an underground cave system, new discoveries hint.</p>



<p>Researchers have found <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/december-1-future-exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remnants of small fireplaces and sooty wall and ceiling smudges</a> in passages and chambers throughout South Africa’s Rising Star cave complex, paleoanthropologist Lee Berger announced in a December 1 lecture hosted by the Carnegie Institution of Science in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>“Signs of fire use are everywhere in this cave system,” said Berger, of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.</p>





<p><em>H. naledi</em> presumably lit the blazes in the caves since remains of no other hominids have turned up there, the team says. But the researchers have yet to date the age of the fire remains.&nbsp;And researchers outside Berger’s group have yet to evaluate the new finds.</p>



<p><em>H. naledi </em>fossils date to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans">between 335,000 and 236,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 5/9/17</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim">around the time<em> Homo sapiens</em> originated</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/17</em>). Many researchers suspect that regular use of fire by hominids for light, warmth and cooking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ashes-oldest-controlled-fire">began roughly 400,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 4/2/12</em>).</p>



<p>Such behavior has not been attributed to <em>H. naledi</em> before, largely because of its small brain. But it’s now clear that a brain roughly one-third the size of human brains today still enabled <em>H. naledi</em> to achieve control of fire, Berger contends.</p>



<p>Last August, Berger climbed down a narrow shaft and examined two underground chambers where <em>H. naledi</em> fossils had been found. He noticed stalactites and thin rock sheets that had partly grown over older ceiling surfaces. Those surfaces displayed blackened, burned areas and were also dotted by what appeared to be soot particles, Berger said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, expedition codirector and Wits paleoanthropologist Keneiloe Molopyane led excavations of a nearby cave chamber. There, the researchers uncovered two small fireplaces containing charred bits of wood, and burned bones of antelopes and other animals. Remains of a fireplace and nearby burned animal bones were then discovered in a more remote cave chamber where <em>H. naledi</em> fossils have been found, Berger said.</p>



<p>Still, the main challenge for investigators will be to date the burned wood and bones and other fire remains from the Rising Star chambers and demonstrate that the material comes from the same sediment layers as <em>H. naledi</em> fossils, says paleoanthropologist W. Andrew Barr of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>





<p>“That’s an absolutely critical first step before it will be possible to speculate about who may have made fires for what reason,” Barr says.</p>



<p>Bone, wood and charcoal from the South African site should also be examined with various techniques to determine whether darkened areas resulted from burning or mineral staining, says Harvard University archaeologist Sarah Hlubik, who wasn&#8217;t involved in the research. And a careful analysis of the layout of remains in the Rising Star chambers, she adds, will indicate whether Berger’s group discovered small fireplaces built by cave visitors, or only bones and other material that washed into the cave system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-evolution-supercomputer-animation-stars-galaxies">A new supercomputer simulation animates the evolution of the universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>The infant universe transforms from a featureless landscape to an intricate web in a new supercomputer simulation of the cosmos’s formative years.</p>



<p>An animation from the simulation shows our universe changing from a smooth, cold gas cloud to the lumpy scattering of galaxies and stars that we see today. It’s the most complete, detailed and accurate <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/516/3/3389/6675818?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reproduction of the universe’s evolution</a> yet produced, researchers report in the November <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>





<p>This virtual glimpse into the cosmos’s past is the result of CoDaIII, the third iteration of the Cosmic Dawn Project, which traces the history of the universe, beginning with the “cosmic dark ages” about 10 million years after the Big Bang. At that point, hot gas produced at the very beginning of time, about 13.8 billion years ago, had cooled to a featureless cloud devoid of light, says astronomer Paul Shapiro of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>

</div><figcaption>The universe was a cold, dark place 10 million years after the Big Bang. Hydrogen gas began to clump together 100 million years later, forming dense regions (white) that gave birth to the first stars and galaxies, as seen in this animation from a new simulation of the early universe. Light radiating from the stars (blue) heated the gas around the galaxies as matter collected in a weblike arrangement. The pink bursts are high-temperature regions that appeared as some stars exploded. The galaxies and stars we see today lie along the filaments that resulted from the complicated interplay between matter and starlight as the universe evolved.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Roughly 100 million years later, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/past-according-planck-cosmologists-got-lot-right">tiny ripples in the gas left over from the Big Bang</a> caused the gases to clump together (<em>SN: 2/19/15</em>). This led to long, threadlike strands that formed a web of matter where galaxies and stars were born.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;As radiation from the early galaxies illuminated the universe, it ripped electrons from atoms in the once-cold gas clouds during a period called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/faint-distant-galaxies-may-have-driven-early-universe-makeover">epoch of reionization</a>, which continued until about 700 million years after the Big Bang (<em>SN: 2/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>CoDaIII is the first simulation to fully account for the complicated interaction between radiation and the flow of matter in the universe, Shapiro says. It spans the time from the cosmic dark ages and through the next several billion years as the distribution of matter in the modern universe formed.</p>



<p>The animation from the simulation, Shapiro says, graphically shows how the structure of the early universe is “imprinted on the galaxies today, which remember their youth, or their birth or their ancestors from the epoch of reionization.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sale-t-rex-fossil-big-loss-science-dinosaur">Why the sale of a T. rex fossil could be a big loss for science</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> isn’t just a king to paleontologists — the dinosaur increasingly reigns over the world of art auctions. A nearly complete skeleton known as Stan the <em>T. rex</em> smashed records in October 2020 when a bidding war drove its price to $31.8 million, the highest ever paid for any fossil. Before that, Sue the <em>T. rex</em> held the top spot; it went for $8.3 million in 1997.</p>



<p>That kind of publicity — and cachet — means that <em>T. rex</em>’s value is sky-high, and the dinosaur continues to have its teeth firmly sunk into the auction world in 2022. In December, Maximus, a <em>T. rex</em> skull, will be the centerpiece of a Sotheby’s auction in New York City. It’s expected to sell for about $15 million.</p>



<p>Another <em>T. rex fossil </em>named Shen was anticipated to sell for between $15 million and $25 million at a Christie’s auction in Hong Kong in late November. However, the auction house pulled it over concerns about the number of replica bones used in the fossil.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-800x450.jpg" alt="A photo of T. rex skeleton in a running position on a black background" class="wp-image-3119478" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-1030x580.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat-1380x776.jpg 1380w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/111522_cg_private-dino-fossils_feat.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3119478">Shen (pictured) was slated to be the first <em>T. rex</em> fossil ever sold at auction in Asia, with an expected price of $15 million to $25 million. That auction was withdrawn due to questions over the number of replica bones in the fossil.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119478">Marcus Müller-Witte, M.A./Courtesy of Christie&#8217;s</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“These are astronomical sums of money, really surprising sums of money,” says Donna Yates, a criminologist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who studies high-value collectibles.</p>



<p>Stan’s final price “was completely unexpected,” Yates says. The fossil was originally appraised at about $6 million — still a very large sum, though nothing like the final tally, which was the result of a three-way bidding war.</p>





<p>But the staggering amounts of money <em>T. rex</em> fossils now fetch at auction can mean a big loss for science. At those prices, the public institutions that might try to claim these glimpses into the deep past are unable to compete with deep-pocketed private buyers, researchers say.</p>



<p>One reason for the sky-high prices may be that <em>T. rex</em> fossils are increasingly being treated more like rare works of art than bits of scientific evidence, Yates says. The bones might once have been bought and sold at dusty “cowboy fossil” dealerships. But nowadays these fossils are on display in shiny gallery spaces and are being appraised and marketed as rare objets d’art. That’s appealing to collectors, she adds: “If you’re a high-value buyer, you’re a person who wants the finest things.”</p>



<p>But fossils’ true value is the information they hold, says Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis. “They are our only means of understanding the biology and evolution of extinct animals.”</p>



<p>Keeping fossils of <em>T. rex </em>and other dinosaurs and animals in public repositories, such as museums, ensures that scientists have consistent access to study the objects, including being able to replicate or reevaluate previous findings. But a fossil sold into private or commercial hands is subject to the whim of its owner — which means anything could happen to it at any time, Carr says.</p>





<p>“It doesn’t matter if [a <em>T. rex</em> fossil] is bought by some oligarch in Russia who says scientists can come and study it,” he says. “You might as well take a sledgehammer to it and destroy it.”</p>



<h4>A desire for one’s own <em>T. rex</em></h4>



<p>There are only about 120 known specimens of <em>T. rex</em> in the world. At least half of them are owned privately and aren’t available to the public. That loss is “wreaking havoc on our dataset. If we don’t have a good sample size, we can’t claim to know anything about [<em>T. rex</em>],” Carr says.</p>



<p>For example, to be able to tell all the ways that <em>T. rex </em>males differed from females, researchers need between 70 and 100 good specimens for statistically significant analyses, an amount scientists don’t currently have.</p>



<p>Similarly, scientists know little about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/small-cousins-tyrannosaurus-rex-may-have-actually-been-growing-teenagers">how <em>T. rex</em> grew</a>, and studying fossils of youngsters could help (<em>SN: 1/6/20</em>). But only a handful of juvenile <em>T. rex</em> specimens are publicly available to researchers. That number would double if private specimens were included.</p>



<p>Museums and academic institutions typically don’t have the kind of money it takes to compete with private bidders in auctions or any such competitive sales. That’s why, in the month before Stan went up for auction in 2020, the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology, or SVP, <a href="https://vertpaleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SVP-letter-to-Christies-Auction-House.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a letter to Christie’s</a> asking the auction house to consider restricting bidding to public institutions. The hope was that this would give scientists a fighting chance to obtain the specimens.</p>



<p>But the request was ignored — and unfortunately may have only increased publicity for the sale, says Stuart Sumida, a paleontologist at California State University in San Bernardino and SVP’s current vice president. That’s why SVP didn’t issue a public statement this time ahead of the auctions for Shen and Maximus, Sumida says, though the organization continues to strongly condemn fossil sales — whether of large, dramatic specimens or less well-known creatures. “All fossils are data. Our position is that selling fossils is not scientific and it damages science.”</p>



<p>Sumida is particularly appalled at statements made by auction houses that suggest the skeletons “have already been studied,” an attempt to reassure researchers that the data contained in that fossil won’t be lost, regardless of who purchases it. That’s deeply misleading, he says, because of the need for reproducibility, as well as the always-improving development of new analysis techniques. “When they make public statements like that, they are undermining not only paleontology, but the scientific process as well.”</p>



<p>And the high prices earned by Stan and Sue are helping to drive the market skyward, not only for other <em>T. rex</em> fossils but also for less famous species. “It creates this ripple effect that is incredibly damaging to science in general,” Sumida says. Sotheby’s, for example, auctioned off a <em>Gorgosaurus</em>, a <em>T. rex</em> relative, in July for $6.1 million. In May, a <em>Deinonychus antirrhopus</em> — the inspiration for <em>Jurassic Park</em>’s velociraptor — was sold by Christie’s for $12.4 million.</p>



<h4>Protecting <em>T. rex</em> from collectors</h4>



<p>Compounding the problem is the fact that the United States has no protections in place for fossils unearthed from the backyards or dusty fields of private landowners. The U.S. is home to just about every <em>T. rex</em> skeleton ever found. Stan, Sue and Maximus hail from the Black Hills of South Dakota. Shen was found in Montana.</p>



<p>As of 2009, U.S. law prohibits collecting scientifically valuable fossils, particularly fossils of vertebrate species like <em>T. rex</em>, from public lands without permits. But fossils found on private lands are still considered the landowner’s personal property. And landowners can grant digging access to whomever they wish.</p>

<p>Before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-13-details-custody-battle-largest-t-rex">the discovery of Sue the <em>T. rex</em></a> (<em>SN: 9/6/14</em>), private owners often gave scientific institutions free access to hunt for fossils on their land, says Bridget Roddy, currently a researcher at the legal news company Bloomberg Law in Washington, D.C. But in the wake of Sue’s sale in 1997, researchers began to have to compete for digging access with commercial fossil hunters.</p>



<p>These hunters can afford to pay landowners large sums for the right to dig, or even a share of the profits from fossil sales. And many of these commercial dealers sell their finds at auction houses, where the fossils can earn far more than most museums are able to pay.</p>



<p>Lack of federal protections for paleontological resources found on private land — combined with the large available supply of fossils — is a situation unique to the United States, Roddy says. Fossil-rich countries such as China, Canada, Italy and France consider any such finds to be under government protection, part of a national legacy.</p>



<p>In the United States, seizing such materials from private landowners — under an eminent domain argument — would require the government to pay “just compensation” to the landowners. But using eminent domain to generally protect such fossils wouldn’t be financially sustainable for the government, Roddy says, not least because most fossils dug up aren’t of great scientific value anyway.</p>



<p>There may be other, more grassroots ways to at least better regulate fossil sales, she says. While still a law student at DePaul University in Chicago, Roddy <a href="https://scholarship.law.tamu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1200&amp;context=journal-of-property-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined some of those ideas</a> in an article published in <em>Texas A&amp;M Journal of Property Law</em> in May.</p>



<p>One option, she suggests, is for states to create a selective sales tax attached to fossil purchases, specifically for buyers who intend to keep their purchases in private collections that are not readily available to the public. It’s “similar to if you want to buy a pack of cigarettes, which is meant to offset the harm that buying cigarettes does to society in general,” Roddy says. That strategy could be particularly effective in states with large auction houses, like New York.</p>



<p>Another possibility is to model any new, expanded fossil preservation laws on existing U.S. antiquities laws, intended to preserve cultural heritage. After all, Roddy says, fossils aren’t just bones, but they’re also part of the human story. “Fossils have influenced our folklore; they’re a unifier of humanity and culture rather than a separate thing.”</p>



<p>Though fossils from private lands aren’t protected, many states do impose restrictions on searches for archaeological and cultural artifacts, by requiring those looking for antiquities to restore excavated land or by fining the excavation of certain antiquities without state permission. Expanding those restrictions to fossil hunting, perhaps by requiring state approval through permits, could also give states the opportunity to purchase any significant finds before they’re lost to private buyers.</p>



<h4>Preserving fossils for science and the public</h4>



<p>Such protections could be a huge boon to paleontologists, who may not even know what’s being lost. “The problem is, we’ll never know” all the fossils that are being sold, Sumida says. “They’re shutting scientists out of the conversation.”</p>



<p>And when it comes to dinosaurs, “so many of the species we know about are represented by a single fossil,” says Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. “If that fossil was never found, or disappeared into the vault of a collector, then we wouldn’t know about that dinosaur.”</p>



<p>Or, he says, sometimes a particularly complete or beautifully preserved dinosaur skeleton is found, and without it, “we wouldn’t be able to study what that dinosaur looked like, how it moved, what it ate, how it sensed its world, how it grew.”</p>



<p>The point isn’t to put restrictions on collecting fossils so much as making sure they remain in public view, Brusatte adds. “There’s nothing as magical as finding your own fossils, being the first person ever to see something that lived millions of years ago.” But, he says, unique and scientifically invaluable fossils such as dinosaur skeletons should be placed in museums “where they can be conserved and studied and inspire the public, rather than in the basements or yachts of the oligarch class.”</p>



<p>After its record-breaking sale, Stan vanished for a year and a half, its new owners a mystery. Then in March 2022, news surfaced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/arts/design/stan-t-rex-abu-dhabi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fossil had been bought by the United Arab Emirates</a>, which stated it intends to place Stan in a new natural history museum.</p>

<p>Sue, too, is on public view. The fossil is housed at <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/sue-t-rex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History</a>, thanks to the pooled financial resources of the Walt Disney Corporation, the McDonald Corporation, the California State University System and others. That’s the kind of money it took to get the highest bid on a <em>T. rex</em> 25 years ago.</p>



<p>And those prices only seem to be going up. Researchers got lucky with Sue, and possibly Stan.</p>



<p>As for Shen, the fossil’s fate remains in limbo: It was pulled from auction not due to outcry from paleontologists, but over concerns about intellectual property rights. The fossil, at 54 percent complete, may have been supplemented with a polyurethane cast of bones from Stan, according to representatives of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, S.D. That organization, which discovered Stan, retains a copyright over the skeleton.</p>



<p>In response to those concerns, Christie’s pulled the lot, and now says that it intends to loan the fossil to a museum. But this move doesn’t reassure paleontologists. “A lot of people are pleased that the sale didn’t go through,” Sumida says. “But it sort of just kicks the can down the road.… It doesn’t mean they’re not going to try and sell it in another form, somewhere down the road.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, scientists simply can’t count on every important fossil finding its way to the public, Carr says. “Those fossils belong in a museum; it’s right out of <em>Indiana Jones</em>,” he says. “It’s not like they’re made in a factory somewhere. Fossils are nonrenewable resources. Once Shen is gone, it’s gone.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-fossil-body-like-duck">This dinosaur may have had a body like a duck’s</a></h4>

              
                <p>A dinosaur unearthed in Mongolia is making a splash among paleontologists, as its sleek physique adds potential evidence to the idea that some dinos were suited for life in the water. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a><em>Natovenator polydontus</em></a> may be the first known nonbird dinosaur to have possessed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04119-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a streamlined body comparable to that of modern diving birds</a>, researchers report December 1 in <em>Communications Biology</em>. <em>Natovenator</em> and other closely related dinosaurs may have been swimming predators, the researchers say, challenging the popular notion that all dinos were landlubbers.</p>





<p><em>Natovenator</em> was small like a duck and probably used its forelimbs when swimming, says Yuong-Nam Lee, a vertebrate paleontologist at Seoul National University in South Korea. “We think that <em>Natovenator</em> lived in shallow water and ate small fish,” he says.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that researchers have suspected a nonbird dinosaur of having an aquatic lifestyle. For years, paleontologists have debated whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinosaurus-bones-dinosaur-swim-paleontology">spinosaurs were aquatic predators</a> (<em>SN: 3/23/22</em>). And in 2017, researchers reported that <em>Halszkaraptor </em>—a close relative of <em>Natovenator</em> — had features <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24679" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analogous to those of aquatic birds and reptiles</a>, though the scientists were unable to infer a body shape.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, Lee and colleagues analyzed a well-preserved skeleton from the Hermiin Tsav fossil formation in Mongolia, found in rocks from the Upper Cretaceous, which dates to about 100 million to 66 million years ago. The skull, teeth, neck and limbs of <em>Natovenator</em> are akin to those of <em>Halszkaraptor</em>, the team reports, suggesting the two probably had comparable lives.</p>



<p>What’s more, the orientation of <em>Natovenator</em>’s ribs indicates that it had a streamlined body like that of modern waterfowl, with a compressed and flattened rib cage akin to aquatic reptiles, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The close resemblance between <em>Natovenator</em> and a duck or cormorant is almost certainly an example of what’s known as convergent evolution, says Thomas Holtz Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved in the study. “Similar body plans evolve because of similar lifestyles.”</p>



<p>It remains unclear just how strong a swimmer <em>Natovenator</em> may have been. The dinosaur’s forelimbs appear short, and its hind limbs seem to lack attributes of kick-propelled swimmers like loons, Holtz says. But semiaquatic mammals like minks and some other successful modern swimming predators have skeletons that aren’t highly specialized for life in the water either, he says. “So <em>Natovenator</em>&nbsp;might be intermediate in swimming ability, between something like a mink and a loon.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artemis-mission-new-diverse-crew-astronauts-moon">Artemis missions will usher in a new, more diverse crew of astronauts</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">When astronaut Eugene Cernan stepped from the moon’s surface into his spacecraft in December 1972, he was aware it was the end of an era. His mission, Apollo 17, was the last of the Apollos.</p>



<p>“Take your final look at the valley of Taurus-­Littrow, except from orbit,” Cernan said of the view before the craft lifted off. “We’re on our way, Houston!”</p>



<p>And with that, the last person to walk on the moon returned to Earth. No other boots have touched lunar soil in the 50 years since then.</p>





<p>Now, NASA is preparing to go back, and China is on its way too. On November 16, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-artemis-launch-human-spaceflight-apollo-nasa-china">U.S. Artemis I mission launched</a> to bring the first crew-ready space capsule to the vicinity of the moon since Cernan and his two crewmates left half a century ago.</p>



<p>That spacecraft isn’t carrying any astronauts; the mission was designed to check technology and other systems that will eventually take people to the moon, on Artemis III, no sooner than 2025. This time, NASA says, the intention is to stay longer, to learn how to live on the moon and eventually send people to Mars.</p>



<p>The obvious next question is, who gets to go?</p>



<p>Thanks to social, political and scientific changes over the last 50 years, today’s astronauts are not like the astronauts of the past. They are more diverse in sex, race and field of expertise. The next set of people to walk on the moon will face different challenges and require different skills, temperaments and support systems than the Apollo crews.</p>



<p>And some groups are thinking about how to include people with disabilities in the spacefaring future. Preparing for a more permanent human presence in space will require rethinking the right stuff. Future lunar crews may reflect our lives on Earth more faithfully, making space for everyone.</p>



<h4>Becoming an astronaut</h4>





<p>NASA has declared that upcoming missions to the moon will include a woman and a person of color, setting two firsts for lunar astronauts.</p>



<p>The next visitors to the moon haven’t been selected yet. But there are only about 50 people to choose from. The 43 active astronauts and 10 astronaut candidates, who are still in training, come from a variety of backgrounds. The list includes medical doctors, military pilots, geologists, microbiologists, engineers and others. Of NASA’s active astronauts, about 37 percent are women.</p>



<p>“The astronaut corps is, of course, NASA’s most visible workforce,” says Lori Garver, who was NASA’s deputy administrator from 2009 to 2013. “Because of that, NASA has, I think, a responsibility to have an astronaut corps that reflects the nation.”</p>

Apollo 17’s crew was Harrison Schmitt (back left), Eugene Cernan (front) and Ronald Evans (back right). </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119638">NASA</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Modern astronauts are already different from those of Apollo. For its first class of astronauts in 1959, NASA recruited military fighter pilots shorter than 5 feet, 11 inches (because of the tight space in the Mercury space capsule). At the time, all military test pilots were white men, so all astronauts were too.</p>



<p>NASA recruited its first class of “scientist-­astronauts” in 1964. The move drew criticism from pilots. In an interview, Cernan — who shared his spot on Apollo 17 with the only geologist to walk on the moon, Harrison Schmitt — called science “a parasite” on the moon program. “Science is not the reason we learned to fly,” he griped. Cernan later referred to Schmitt as “Dr. Rock” and worried that he wouldn’t be able to get out of a tough spot on his own.</p>



<p>But according to NASA’s mission report, Apollo 17 was “the most productive and trouble-free manned mission.” It “demonstrated the practicality of training scientists to become qualified astronauts.”</p>



<p>Today, 42 percent of NASA’s active astronauts have a research science or medicine background, in fields ranging from oceanography to physics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="500" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2.jpg" alt="A photo of the 10 astronaut candidates for 2022 in their blue flightsuits" class="wp-image-3119639" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2-521x383.jpg 521w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2-612x450.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-2-253x186.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3119639">The most recent class of NASA astronaut candidates is more diverse.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119639">NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Counterintuitively, though, NASA’s definition of “astronaut” doesn’t require going to space. Once you’ve made it through the strenuous and selective application and training process, you’re a member of the astronaut corps, whether you leave Earth or not.</p>



<p>The first step in applying to be an astronaut is “unnervingly underwhelming,” says geobiologist Zena Cardman, who joined the astronaut corps in 2017 but has not yet been to space. “You submit a very short resume to USAJobs.gov, and then you wait for a long time,” she says. (Full disclosure: I applied to the astronaut program myself in 2012. I kept the rejection postcard for years.)</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/frequently-asked-questions-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimum requirements</a> for applying are being a U.S. citizen, having a master’s degree in engineering, biological science, physical science or math, and two years of professional experience, including teaching or graduate school. Pilots can substitute the two years of experience with 1,000 hours of jet-flying experience. Candidates who make it through that first round travel to Houston for a two-round interview process.</p>



<p>“What we’re looking for in these first few Artemis missions … first and foremost, is technical expertise,” astronaut Reid Wiseman, chief of NASA’s Astronaut Office, said in a news briefing on August 5. A lot of those desired skills revolve around acquiring resources to support long stays.</p>



<p>Artemis III plans to send people to the lunar south pole, which could be a reasonable place to put a long-term base. It has regions that will be in sunlight for the entire 6.5-day mission. The light will help generate energy from solar power. And it has regions in permanent shadow that host pockets of water ice, which could be used for water and fuel for human settlements.</p>



<p>The possibility of finding and using resources on the moon is part of why science backgrounds, especially in geology, are now more important for astronauts. But in the astronaut corps, everyone does everything, Cardman says. Her background is in geology and microbiology. She’s done fieldwork in Antarctica, the Arctic, underground caves and on ocean research vessels. Space “seemed like the ultimate fieldwork endeavor,” she says.</p>



<p>To round out her skills, she’s getting trained in engineering and aviation, and her test pilot colleagues are learning geoscience. “We will have roles, but we won’t be siloed,” she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Science expertise</h3>



<p>A science background is considered a necessity for today’s 43 active astronauts (top). Many are in the military, but also have degrees in medicine, geoscience or physics. The original Apollo astronauts (bottom) were mostly military pilots, some with engineering backgrounds.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skill, the next most important characteristic NASA looks for is: “Are you a team player?” Wiseman says. Working together was important on the Apollo missions. But those missions lasted 12 days at most, with three days tops on the lunar surface. Astronauts on a weeks-long Artemis mission to the moon or a years-long mission to Mars will need to survive in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rigors-mars-trip-make-teamwork-priority">stressful, challenging, isolated environments</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/14, p. 22</em>). Getting along becomes crucial to staying alive.</p>



<p>That explains why the interview process includes teamwork exercises and group dynamic activities to simulate the kinds of situations astronauts would find themselves in, Cardman says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1030" height="619" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030.jpg" alt="NASA engineers wear spacewalk backpacks with headlamps in a dark space" class="wp-image-3119644" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-637x383.jpg 637w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-749x450.jpg 749w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-309x186.jpg 309w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-768x462.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-7_1030-965x580.jpg 965w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3119644">NASA engineers wear spacewalk backpacks with headlamps to practice sample collection in New Mexico.

<p>The interview also involves medical screening. The details are not public, but “they really go quite in depth,” Cardman says. There’s no official requirement for any particular body type or standards for physical fitness, like running a mile in a certain time or doing a certain number of pull-ups. “It’s more functional,” she says. As long as you can meet the mental and physical demands of a spacewalk, it doesn’t matter how you get in shape. Cardman’s exercise of choice is powerlifting.</p>



<p>Ultimately, there are thousands more applicants than there are openings for astronaut jobs. “The final selection is somewhat subjective,” Garver says. “So I think it’s absolutely appropriate that you look at the demographic along with the qualifications.”</p>



<h4>Take it to the limit</h4>



<p>There’s one other medical requirement for the next people to walk on the moon: They can’t have already spent too much time in space.</p>



<p>Over time, exposure to the harmful charged particles that zip around space can increase a person’s risk of developing cancer. For <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronauts-mars-space-health-survival">astronauts’ safety</a>, NASA limits the amount of radiation an astronaut can absorb over their career. (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>From 1995 until 2021, those bounds were dependent on an astronaut’s age and sex. The limit was the amount of radiation that correlates with a 3 percent risk of dying from cancer caused by radiation exposure. But because women were considered to have higher risks of dying from radiation-­related cancers, that limit grounded female astronauts earlier than males. </p>



<p>Effectively, women were allowed about 150 millisieverts of radiation in their careers, while men were allowed closer to 800 millisieverts, says emergency medicine physician and aerospace engineer Erik Antonsen of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p>



<p>“It was a consequence of the way we were calculating risk that women were being limited much earlier in their career and could not fly as much as men,” Antonsen says. “We had to dive deep into that stuff, come back up for air and say, hey man, there’s not justification for this stuff. And it’s causing discrimination against females.” </p>



<p>Antonsen notes that no openly transgender astronauts have flown, but he can’t think of any medical issues that would hold them back.</p>



<p>In 2021, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/26155/chapter/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a report urging NASA to change the limit</a> to 600 millisieverts of radiation over a career for everyone, regardless of sex or age. That amounts to about 400 days in orbit around the moon or 680 days on the lunar surface, some of the time in a habitat, for an astronaut with no other spaceflight exposures.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="696" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-3.jpg" alt="A man and woman stand in a prototype of a new lunar landing spacesuit" class="wp-image-3119640" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-3-374x383.jpg 374w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-3-440x450.jpg 440w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-3-182x186.jpg 182w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/120322_spaceflight-prep_inline-3-567x580.jpg 567w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3119640">In a prototype space suit — the actual Artemis suit is not yet designed —

<p>NASA, the German Aerospace Center and the Israel Space Agency are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-artemis-moon-landing-test-launch">flying a pair of dummies on Artemis I</a> to test a radiation protection vest for female astronauts, which might help reduce radiation risks further if worn on future missions.</p>



<p>That could all be good news for Cardman. She and her cohort, who are beginning to fly missions to the International Space Station, are likely candidates for Artemis III. Cardman herself could be the first woman on the moon.</p>



<p>She’s modest about it. “I would be thrilled to go to the moon, of course,” she says. “Depending on the timeline, who knows. But it’s pretty exciting to know I work with the people who will be the first ones setting foot on the moon in half a century.”</p>



<h4>The new right stuff</h4>



<p>Even though there are no official astronaut health standards, NASA does end up selecting “the healthiest damn people to fly,” Antonsen says.</p>



<p>Commercial spaceflight is expanding the pool of people who get to go to space. Companies like SpaceX, which is building the moon lander for Artemis III, and Blue Origin are already sending paying customers on space joyrides. These companies have different goals, incentives and risk tolerances than NASA does.</p>



<p>“The beautiful thing about this is, the goal is eventually to send just people,” Antonsen says. “It’s changing. And it should change.”</p>



<p>SpaceX would not comment on how it chooses who it sends to space. But Antonsen speculates that some companies’ only criteria for their customers will be “making sure they can walk up the stairs to get to the vehicle.”</p>



<p>And even that might not be the final barrier for long. Some organizations are investigating how disabled people can live and work in space.</p>



<p>“Disability inclusion affects how we design our spacecraft,” says AJ Link, communications director of the nonprofit advocacy group AstroAccess. “If we can make space accessible, we can make any space accessible.”</p>



<p>By organizing flights for disabled people on zero gravity aircraft, AstroAccess aims to show that disabled people have strengths that could be useful in space. In October 2021, 12 people with various disabilities took a parabolic flight, in which the plane took a repeating upward and downward trajectory to give the passengers inside a few minutes of weightlessness.</p>

Linguist Sheri Wells-Jensen (back row, second from left), who is blind, was surprised that her usual instincts worked differently in zero G.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119641">ASTROACCESS/ZERO G CORPORATION</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“My personal, emotional conclusion was, it was wicked fun,” says Sheri Wells-Jensen, a linguist at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Wells-­Jensen, who is blind, was one of the people on that flight. She plans to try it again in December, on the anniversary of Apollo 17’s departure from the moon, despite describing herself as a “big chicken.”</p>



<p>“I’m not a thrill seeker. I don’t even like roller coasters,” she says. But in zero g, she was “surprised by how not terrified” she was.</p>



<p>She was also surprised at how useless her normal instincts were. In simulated lunar gravity, a tiny hop sent her flying to conk her head on the ceiling. The plane was so noisy that her normal ways of orienting by sound didn’t work. She felt like there was no up or down. “I’m damn well oriented on Earth, but boy, there were several moments there where I had nothing,” she says.</p>



<p>Learning how disabled people behave on spaceflights will help all astronauts in the future, regardless of disability, Wells-Jensen says.</p>

<p>“Space is a profoundly disabling environment. It’s always trying to kill you,” Wells-Jensen says. What happens if an astronaut loses their vision, whether temporarily or permanently, on the way to Mars? Or if the spacecraft lights go off, or smoke makes it hard to see? Designing a spacecraft to be used by blind people, she says, will help all astronauts navigate those situations.</p>



<p>Similarly, if an astronaut loses use of their legs, knowing how people with amputations or limb deficiencies navigate a spacecraft will give them options. “For able-bodied people who acquire a disability in space, we’re not just going to send them home,” Wells-Jensen says. “How do we make sure they’re safe and can still do their jobs?”</p>



<p>Wells-Jensen hopes that sending disabled people on zero-g flights will raise awareness of how capable they are as well. “A disabled person could take a suborbital flight tomorrow,” she says. “I think at this point, the limiting factor is cultural, rather than technological.”</p>



<p>The European Space Agency is also recruiting disabled astronauts, with physical characteristics such as limb deficiencies or short stature that would normally disqualify them. These &#8220;parastronauts&#8221; will help study the kinds of adaptations needed for disabled people to fly in space. In November, <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Astronauts/John_McFall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESA named its first parastronaut</a>: John McFall, a British paralympic sprinter and orthopedist, whose right leg was amputated after a motorcycle accident when he was 19.</p>



<p>Both ESA and AstroAccess argue that now is the time to consider accessibility in space, before the spacefaring vehicles of the future are finalized.</p>



<p>“Retrofitting is hard,” Wells-Jensen says. “Building things the way you want them is much easier.”</p>



<p>That could be especially important for private companies like SpaceX that are designing moon vehicles. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees <a href="https://www.faa.gov/space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial space transportation</a>, has a legal moratorium on setting regulations about the safety of participants in private spaceflights until October 2023 to give the industry time to get established and collect data. AstroAccess, for one, wants to help guide those regulations.</p>



<p>“We want to fundamentally change the way humanity goes to space,” Wells-Jensen says. “We can’t become a spacefaring species if only some of us can go.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hawaii-mauna-loa-volcano-erupting-what-you-need-to-know">Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano is erupting. Here’s what you need to know</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mauna Loa, Earth’s largest active volcano, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/mauna-loa/mauna-loa-eruption-webpage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abruptly woke up on November 27</a> after an almost 40-year nap. The volcano shot fountains of lava as high as 50 meters into the air, while rivers of molten rock streamed down the volcano’s flanks toward Saddle Road, the main highway on Hawaii’s Big Island.</p>



<p>Mauna Loa stands shoulder to shoulder with four other volcanoes, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kilauea-volcano-pyrotechnics-lava-no-signs-stopping">explosively dramatic Kilauea</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/18</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mauna-kea-volcano-dormant-tiny-earthquakes-gas-magma">quietly grumbling Mauna Kea</a> (<em>SN: 5/14/20</em>). Kilauea has grabbed headlines in recent years with its pyrotechnics while Mauna Loa has slumbered. But the sleeping giant hasn’t been so quiet in the past, says Ingrid Johanson, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in Hilo.</p>





<p>Historically, she says, Mauna Loa would awaken every seven years or so on average. This last stretch between eruptions “is quite a big gap.”</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> talked with Johanson about how Mauna Loa tends to wake up, what’s in the path of the lava and what sort of neighbors Kilauea and Mauna Loa are.</p>



<h4>Were there warning signs that Mauna Loa was about to erupt?</h4>



<p>“It depends on what you mean by warning,” Johanson says. “In a manner of speaking, we’ve known that Mauna Loa was showing signs of unrest since 2015.” At that time, she says, there was an uptick in the rate of local earthquakes, as well as in GPS observations of land deformation — a bulging upward of the land surface that indicates magma is on the move below ground. </p>



<p>Those signs tapered off a bit and then increased again over the last six months, suggesting “that the situation was evolving,” Johanson says. But when the volcano would actually erupt wasn’t possible to determine. “Fundamentally, we had about an hour and a half of warning,” she says. That was the time span between when researchers noted a sudden swarm of earthquakes pointing to an imminent eruption and the emergence of lava.</p>



<p>That short notice is “true to form” for Mauna Loa, she adds. Its “other eruptions have evolved very quickly in the same way.”</p>



<h4>How is the monitoring of Mauna Loa different than it was before the last eruption in 1984?</h4>





<p>“One of the big differences between 1984 and now is the technology,” Johanson says.</p>



<p>“We can see more earthquakes [and] detect a wider range of frequencies in the seismic waves. And we have GPS and electronic tiltmeters to measure deformation continuously.” That technology allowed scientists to detect not only that there was land deformation recently, but also how it was changing over time, giving just a bit of extra warning time.</p>



<p>That wasn’t possible 40 years ago. Back then, researchers measured deformation by hand, hiking up to the volcano’s summit every few weeks or so. “There was a technique called EDM, for electronic distance measuring, which was essentially shining a laser into a reflector, so you could get very precise distance measurements,” Johanson says. Subtle shifts in the reflector’s location, installed on the volcano, helped reveal the deformation.</p>



<h4>Does the current eruption pose a threat to people?</h4>



<p>“It’s a little early to tell — it’s not yet clear how much volume we can expect out of this eruption,” Johanson says. “I don’t think it’s a given that this will be a more momentous eruption than past ones, but there is a sense of maybe coming back to business as usual for the volcano.”</p>

<p>The good news is that the lava flows don’t currently pose a threat to communities on the Big Island. However, Saddle Road connects the island’s eastern and western sides, Johanson notes. “If the lava were to cross the highway, it would really impact the island.”</p>



<p>But the eruption has interrupted data collection for one of climate science’s most iconic charts: the Keeling Curve, a nearly unbroken 60-year record of atmospheric carbon dioxide that shows a steady rise in levels of the gas.</p>



<p>The carbon dioxide data are collected from instruments at the Mauna Loa Observatory. &nbsp;<a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/2022/11/29/historic-keeling-curve-observation-interrupted-by-volcanic-eruption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The eruption cut off power to the observatory</a> on November 28. As of November 30, the power had not yet been restored, and lava flows had cut off access to the site. For now, it’s unclear if the interruption will have a lasting impact on data collection.</p>



<h4>Kilauea has been erupting more or less continuously for decades. How are Kilauea and Mauna Loa connected?</h4>



<p>They are two separate volcanoes with geochemically distinct lavas, suggesting their plumbing systems — the networks of tunnels and channels through which magma moves — are separate. That plumbing separation probably occurs below the crust and in the mantle, Johanson says, though ultimately the volcanoes tap into the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-hot-spots-shallow-heat-source-tectonic-plates-mantle">same mantle hot spot</a> (<em>SN: 1/6/22</em>). </p>



<p>That said, Kilauea and Mauna Loa are uneasy neighbors, communicating through changes in pressure and stress underground, she says. Pressure changes in the plumbing beneath one volcano can subtly affect the other, for example, altering how easy it is for one volcano to expand, making way for more magma to move in. “They do kind of elbow each other a little bit.”</p>

<p>Following severe population decline and local extinction due to habitat loss and persecution, the European wildcat has recently reappeared in several human-dominated regions in Germany. In <em>BMC Genomics</em>, scientists from the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Center in Germany research the consequences of human disturbance on the genetic structure of this elusive species.</p>
<p>The researchers sequenced and analysed the genomes of 47 wildcats and 16 domestic cats and found that the main population divergence between wildcats in eastern and central Germany occurred within the past 200 years. The authors speculate this change in genomic structure is likely the result of isolated populations due to human-driven habitat fragmentation rather than ancient historical events.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the group found that highly differentiated genes between wild cat populations were involved in producing the neuromodulator serotonin. Serotonin plays a role in stress susceptibility and tolerance. Therefore, this finding points toward the potential adaptation of wildcat populations to human-dominated environments.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Understanding footballers&#8217; long-term health can help clinicians make good decisions about player health during and after their career. In </span><em>BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation</em>, researchers evaluate <span data-preserver-spaces="true">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the effect of football on the lumbar spine and discern clinically significant pathology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The researchers analysed MRI scans of the lumbar spines of 18 elite male adolescent footballers exhibiting no symptoms and found that pathology was common (15 of 18 players presented ≤1 abnormality). However, the authors observed that lumbar spine pathology does not appear as prevalent among footballers compared to elite athletes from other sports, which place greater demands on the spine, such as tennis. The researchers stress that clinicians should interpret signs of spinal pathology with caution, as they may not correlate to clinical presentation given that the population studied was asymptomatic.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This study also supports using MRI 3D VIBE sequencing as an alternative to Computerised Tomography (CT) to diagnose and assess the healing of stress fractures to the spine in elite footballers. Such volumetric MRI could negate the requirement for CT and its accompanying radiation exposure. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unsafe abortion is a leading – but preventable – cause of maternal deaths and morbidities. According to the World Health Organisation, around 45% of all abortions are unsafe, of which 97% occur in developing countries. In <em>BMC Women&#8217;s Health</em>, researchers perform a systematic review to investigate the factors which influence decision-making on abortion in legally restricted settings in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After analysing 46 articles that met the review&#8217;s inclusions criteria, the authors indentified four primary themes that influenced women&#8217;s abortion-related decision-making processes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the role of knowledge (including of laws, methods and sources)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the role of safety (including medical, legal and social safety)</span></li>

</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The study demonstrates that women&#8217;s choices after deciding to terminate a pregnancy are shaped by myriad factors &#8211; particularly when abortion is legally restricted. Therefore, to reduce the likelihood of harm and meet women&#8217;s abortion needs to the full limit of the law, a better understanding of how these factors work in concert is needed.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammoths-extinct-earlier-edna-evidence">Mammoths may have gone extinct much earlier than DNA suggests</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some ancient DNA may be leading paleontologists astray in attempts to date when woolly mammoths and woolly rhinos went extinct.</p>



<p>In 2021, an analysis of plant and animal DNA from sediment samples from the Arctic, spanning about the last 50,000 years, suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clovis-hunter-stone-points-mammoth-kill-north-america">mammoths survived</a> in north-central Siberia as late as about 3,900 years ago (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>). That’s much later than when the youngest mammoth fossil found in continental Eurasia suggests the animals died out; it dates to about 10,700 years ago. Only on Wrangel Island off the coast of Siberia and the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea were mammoths known to have survived later.</p>





<p>The finding was one of several in recent years using ancient DNA found in sediment and other environmental material to suggest new insights into animal extinctions. Genetic evidence from woolly rhinos in Eurasia and horses in Alaska have also indicated that these animals remained thousands of years longer in some areas than was thought.</p>



<p>But thousands of years is also how long the animals’ large bones can linger on the ground in the frigid north, slowly weathering and shedding tiny bits of DNA, two researchers write November 30 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>That means that the youngest ancient DNA in sediment samples may have come from such bones, not living mammoths, woolly rhinos and other megafauna. Studies that rely on this genetic evidence could <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05416-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skew estimates of when these animals went extinct by thousands of years</a> toward the present, say paleontologists Joshua Miller of the University of Cincinnati and Carl Simpson of the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>



<p>When, and why, mammoths and some other Ice Age creatures died out is a lingering mystery. Dating when these animals went extinct could help reveal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-mammoths-competed-other-animals-and-lost">what drove them to their demise</a> — humans, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/woolly-rhinos-extinction-climate-change">a warming climate</a>, some combination of the two or something else entirely (<em>SN: 11/13/18; SN: 8/13/20</em>).<br><br>But getting a good sense of when a species disappeared from its range, or from the planet, is not straightforward. For long-gone animals, fossils can help, but it would be a huge coincidence if the youngest fossil ever found of an extinct species was also the last individual to live.</p>



<p>Where fossils give out, DNA has started to take over. For the last two decades, environmental DNA, or eDNA, has become a go-to technique to find out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-dna-air-scientist-vacuum-first-time-zoo">what organisms are living</a>, or used to live, in a certain place (<em>SN: 1/18/22</em>).<br><br>Paleontologists generally focus on a variant of eDNA that gloms onto minerals and other material and gets buried over time. That “sedimentary ancient DNA,” or sedaDNA, is what evolutionary geneticist Yucheng Wang of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues analyzed in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04016-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2021 study on mammoths</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The DNA can come from a living animal, but it can also come from poop, from bones,&#8221; Miller says. &#8220;In our case, we&#8217;re focusing on bones.&#8221;</p>



<p>In warmer climates, a bone lasts long enough to spread DNA for at most a few decades, which usually is not important for getting a general date of extinction, he says. “But up in these cold settings, you would expect a much, much larger, even millennial-scale gap.&#8221;</p>





<p>Miller and Simpson base their estimates of how long the bones of dead mammoths can shed DNA into the environment on radiocarbon dating of the bones of large animals found on the Earth’s surface in cold places today. Caribou antlers as old as 2,000 years have been found on the islands of Svalbard in Norway and Ellesmere Island in Canada, and 5,000-year-old remains of elephant seals near the coastline of Antarctica.<br><br>Wang and his colleagues disagree that the mammoth eDNA in their sample could be partly from cold, old bones weathering down. In a reply in the same issue of <em>Nature, </em>they point out, for instance, that the very youngest mammoth eDNA they found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05417-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows low genetic diversity</a>, precisely what you&#8217;d expect if the DNA actually came from a declining population at the end of the mammoth&#8217;s time on Earth, instead of from a thriving population earlier on.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think Miller and Simpson bring up a valid point for further testing and analysis,” says evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar, a pioneer of eDNA research who wasn’t involved in the 2021 mammoth study. “But I don’t think that their analysis is nearly sufficient to combat the multiple avenues of evidence which suggest late persisting megafauna,&#8221; says Poinar, of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. He points out, for example, that in Wang’s study the DNA evidence tracks the plants of the time period. This suggests woolly mammoths in north-central Siberia could persist thanks to the steppe-tundra, which was their natural habitat, holding on there.<br><br>For Miller, the time span between the youngest known mammoth skeletal remains from north-central Siberia and the youngest mammoth eDNA reported by Wang and his colleagues is just too suspicious.</p>



<p>&#8220;That paper gives us scientific permission to really expect bones to be out there that are much younger than we have seen. There should be dozens, or hundreds of [such relatively recent] dead mammoths somewhere,” he says. “People have been looking for them…. And you just don&#8217;t find anything younger.&#8221;</p>

<p>“The way that divers describe it,” says fluid mechanics researcher Elizabeth Gregorio of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., “is that they want to pull the splash in with them.” The goal is a nearly splashless rip entry that Gregorio says makes a sound resembling tearing paper.</p>





<p>To study the move, Gregorio duplicated it with hinged models that bend in the middle, much as a diver bends at the hips. She plunged the models into water to simulate divers in action. </p>



<p>Angles cut into the model re-created the shape of a diver’s head and arms. The shape meant the model folded in the middle, just as the angle of a diver’s arms and head after entering the water helps the athlete bend at the hips to execute a submerged turn.</p>



<p>The folded model pulled air behind it to create a large, air-filled cavity under the water. It’s the same thing that happens when a diver turns underwater following a dive. </p>

The resulting bubble explains how elite divers can achieve low-splash, high-scoring rip entries.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3119593">E. Gregorio/George Washington University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The effect, Gregorio says, “reduces the jets that would come up after you enter the water,” leading to a score-boosting rip entry. Instead of “pulling the splash in,” the air-filled cavity prevents the splash from forming in the first place.</p>



<p>The research isn’t all about divers’ technique. Gregorio wonders if rip entries reduce the forces divers experience on impact. If so, the studies could help with splashdowns for returning space missions. She also imagines stealthy drones that slip into water without leaving attention-grabbing splashes behind.</p>

<p><strong>A get-sober pill? </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 18, 1972</p>



<p>Researchers at the Tucson Veterans Administration Hospital have been able to reduce intoxication time in rats by administrating harmless chemicals…. Injections of vitamin B3, and vitamin B5 with cystine, were successful&#8230; Glyceraldehyde, however, was effective when ingested and sodium acetate (still untested orally) is expected to be even more effective.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Inebriation and the dreaded hangover that follows still don’t have cures — but scientists haven’t stopped searching. A compound in the seeds of Japanese raisin trees appeared to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drug-gives-rats-booze-guzzling-superpowers">fend off drunkenness in rats</a> and sober them up (<em>SN: 1/4/12</em>), but follow-up research found <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33656905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no effect</a>. Remedies that <em>have</em> worked in rodents have not yet led to treatments for people. </p>



<p>In July, an antihangover supplement became available in the United Kingdom and may soon appear in U.S. stores. The Swedish company that makes this probiotic pill, Myrkle (pronounced &#8220;miracle&#8221;), claims that it can break down <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/11786388221108919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 percent of the alcohol</a> in a person’s system in one hour. But the claim is based on a single study conducted by the company. &nbsp;</p>
