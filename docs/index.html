<p>A journal says it will retract a 2019 paper on an Alzheimer&#8217;s treatment after an institutional investigation found research misconduct, according to emails seen by Retraction Watch. The move comes four years after another investigation by the same university uncovered image duplication in a different paper by a similar group of authors.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(19)31323-X/fulltext">The paper</a>, published in <em>Biological Psychiatry</em>,<em> </em>describes the potential of an apoE antagonist for treatment in Alzheimer’s disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://hscweb3.hsc.usf.edu/blog/2019/06/11/researchers-discover-potential-new-therapeutic-target-for-alzheimers-disease/">2019 news release </a>by the University of South Florida, home to several of the researchers involved in the study, called the work “promising.” Lead author <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3599-6859">Darrell Sawmiller</a>, an assistant professor at USF, said the study represented “the first time … we have direct evidence” apoE “acts as an essential molecule” in the mechanisms leading to Alzheimer’s. </p>



<span id="more-133134"></span>



<p>The paper has been cited 32 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. Jun Tan, the corresponding author on the paper, is no longer with USF but was formerly the Robert A. Silver Chair in Developmental Neurobiology at the university. His <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X25002352">most recent publication</a> lists dual affiliations with institutions in China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have asked the university for the investigation but have not received a reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tan was one of several dozen researchers who study Alzheimer’s disease whose papers had been questioned on PubPeer and described in investigative journalist Charles Piller’s recent book, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/04/undisclosed-conflicts-lightning-fast-peer-review-one-alzheimers-journals-role-in-a-failed-drug/"><em>Doctored</em></a><em>. </em>According to the book, Tan “did not respond to queries about apparent image doctoring in fifteen studies — many concerning amyloid-beta in animal testing.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jun_tan_usf.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="400" height="500" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jun_tan_usf.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-133136" style="width:200px" srcset="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jun_tan_usf.jpg 400w, https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jun_tan_usf-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jun Tan<br><em>USF</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The<em> </em>article marks the second retraction for Sawmiller, Tan, and several other common authors. The first was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2017279">a 2017 paper</a> in <em>Cell Death and Disease</em>. <em>&nbsp;</em>A USF investigation into that work found “inappropriately duplicated images” and that the “text associated with them are not scientifically defensible,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-021-04444-7">the December 2021 notice</a> says. The paper, which describes lithium’s potential as a treatment for Alzheimer’s, has been cited 21 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sleuth Kevin Patrick raised concerns about the <em>Biological Psychiatry</em> paper on PubPeer in October 2021. One of the images in the paper “seems to be duplicated … although the brightness is slightly different, suggesting that this isn’t merely due to an error during figure assembly,” <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/71220E3664E86C95C8B075ACB9F30D">Patrick wrote</a> under his known pseudonym “Actinopolyspora biskrensis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick sent the PubPeer comment to the journal that same month. Editor Rhiannon Bugno told Patrick in January of this year the journal had “continued to regularly follow up with the institution.” Bugno also wrote the university told her the “investigation itself was concluded,” but USF “has yet to share any information/findings from the investigation with us.” She followed up in a later email saying the journal was “considering whether to take any action in the interim.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 16, Bugno told Patrick in an email USF “has informed us that research misconduct was identified. Therefore, we are retracting the paper.” Bugno did not reply to our email asking when the journal plans to issue the retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Tan’s tenure at USF, he was the principal investigator on <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NIH-funding-for-Jun-Tan-@-Univ.-of-South-Fla-NIH-RePORT.pdf">over $6 million in grants</a> from the National Institutes of Health, according to NIH RePORTER.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity, resolutions, at Springer Nature, told us the investigation into the <em>Cell Death and Disease</em> paper was initiated by comments on PubPeer, but USF reached out while the investigation was in progress to recommend retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick had also flagged that paper on PubPeer, noting <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/683702B169AF039424CA02666BE720">in a 2019 comment</a> two parts of a figure which “appear to include multiple areas of overlap.” In 2021, after the article was retracted, Patrick wrote on PubPeer the concerning images “seem to originate from the <a href="https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8875&amp;context=etd">Ph.D. thesis of the first author</a>,” <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9496-3681">Ahsan Habib</a>. Habib earned his doctorate from USF in 2018 and is an author on both the <em>Cell Death and Disease</em> and <em>Biological Psychiatry</em> papers. His <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahsan-habib-ph-d-61713886/">LinkedIn profile</a> says he is currently a lab tech at food company HP Hood LLC and was formerly a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Aging. </p>



<p>Habib did not respond to our request for comment to his professional and personal emails. We also reached out to Takashi Mori, another common coauthor currently a researcher at Gifu University in Japan, who did not respond to our request for comment. Both disagreed with the retraction in <em>Cell Death and Disease</em>, according to the notice<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sawmiller also did not respond to our request for comment.</p>



<p>Sawmiller, Tan, and Habib, as well as other shared authors on the two papers, received two expressions of concern from Sage’s <em>Cell Transplantation</em> in 2022. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09636897221112706">One, on a paper published in 2015</a>, was issued after Patrick’s <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/78696B4DD54298EFCD2117D06ADCC6#1">PubPeer comment</a> pointed out “unexpected” image duplication. A coauthor on that paper was Paul Sanberg, who, as we <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/08/companys-alzheimers-treatment-study-earns-a-flag/">reported at the time</a>, was co-editor-in-chief of <em>Cell Transplantation</em> and had financial ties to the work, neither of which were disclosed in the conflict of interest section.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://health.usf.edu/medicine/mpp/faculty/psanberg">Sanberg</a>, executive director of USF’s Center of Excellence for Aging, is also a coauthor on the soon-to-be-retracted paper in <em>Biological Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09636897221120609">second expression of concern</a> in <em>Cell Transplantation</em>, for a paper published in 2018, came shortly after the first and followed <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/BA0604B56429507F1DB4AD20975827">Patrick’s PubPeer comments</a> pointing out a splice in one of the figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tan was the corresponding author for all four of the papers and, according to all the notices, didn’t respond to the journals’ inquiries. The <em>Cell Transplantation</em> notices state the “remaining authors noted that the corresponding author has access to all of the data underlying the findings.” Tan did not respond to our multiple requests for comment to several email addresses under his current affiliations.</p>



<p>Several of Tan’s other papers have been <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authors%3A%22Jun+Tan%22">flagged on PubPeer </a>for image issues, including a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/38AB1DF61EB47CF31AD3CEAC3D14AF">second paper</a> from <em>Cell Death and Disease</em>,<em> </em>which Springer Nature has confirmed they are now investigating.&nbsp;</p>

                FAST is the infamous acronym that can help us to recognise the signs of a stroke.  Face. Arms. Speech. Time. Within minutes, a stroke can cause permanent  damage, or even become fatal. Strokes are more common in women and risk increases with age - this could be due to a longer life expectancy than men, but emerging research suggests that there are sex-specific differences relating, not just to the risk of incidence, but to progression and outcomes. So, what are these differences?

<p>To earn their degrees, graduate students at the <a href="https://uotechnology.edu.iq/en/">University of Technology in Baghdad</a> not only must publish research in indexed journals. They also are required to cite articles in their school’s own publications, a document obtained by Retraction Watch shows.</p>



<p>Experts who reviewed the document called the citation requirement “deceptive and despicable” and said it could carry a steep price for the journals involved, one of which is indexed in Scopus.</p>



<p>Coercive citation<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733323000380"> is widespread</a> in academia and can help boost the rankings of<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/08/31/publisher-offers-cash-for-citations/"> publications</a>,<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/did-nasty-publishing-scheme-help-indian-dental-school-win-high-rankings"> institutions</a> and<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02639-9"> individual researchers</a>. The practice is<a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/discussion-document/citation-manipulation"> considered unethical</a> and may<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/06/27/seventeen-journals-lose-impact-factors-for-suspected-citation-manip"> trigger heavy penalties</a>.</p>



<span id="more-133114"></span>



<p>The document we obtained shows the University of Technology has made coercive citation official policy. In an<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf"> order</a> sent July 7 to all of the school’s colleges, the university,<a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-technology-iraq"> one of Iraq’s largest</a> public institutions, set out a number of graduation requirements for its students.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of Requirements for Master and PhD Iraq_Redacted."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-22d88367-97f3-4753-9376-a28d327a2c93" href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Requirements-for-Master-and-PhD-Iraq_Redacted.pdf">Requirements for Master and PhD Iraq_Redacted</a></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Master’s students must publish one research paper in a journal indexed in Elsevier’s Scopus or Clarivate’s Web of Science, two influential databases, or two papers in conference proceedings Scopus has indexed, according to the document. Doctoral students must publish two or more works in indexed journals as well as one paper in one of<a href="https://uotechnology.edu.iq/en/journals/"> the school’s six titles</a> or a “partner journal.”</p>



<p>For these articles to be approved by the school, both master’s and Ph.D. students must cite three research papers published in the university’s journals.</p>



<p>The order came on the heels of a meeting in the spring during which the school’s leadership discussed ways to get its journals indexed in Scopus or Web of Science. One suggestion was to “<a href="https://uotechnology.edu.iq/en/university-president-meets-with-editors-in-chief-of-scientific-journals/">increase citations of published research</a>,” according to a news report on the institution’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, only one of its publications, the<a href="https://iqjap.uotechnology.edu.iq/"> <em>Iraqi Journal of Architecture and Planning</em></a>, is indexed in Scopus.</p>



<p>Professor<a href="https://as.uotechnology.edu.iq/en/khawla-salah-khashan/?__cf_chl_tk=uBNx5zed48UW4kuoJyKbIo32a2NXOaa2tRG7wvsbsBA-1760459569-1.0.1.1-ZZDaXLOvv7xtg54JnzqLY7JLxAji07lE9FiW9UarrvU"> Khawla Salah Khashan</a>, assistant president for scientific affairs at the school, who signed the order and was also present at the spring meeting, did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did the school.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘Deceptive and despicable’ </h3>



<p><a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/john-ioannidis">John Ioannidis</a>, a bibliometrics expert at Stanford University, called the citation requirement “a horrible idea” likely aimed at boosting the rankings of the university journals.</p>



<p>“I cannot see any scientific justification,” Ioannidis told us. ”If these journals are indexed in databases that produce Impact Factor or related metrics, this alone may be good reason to remove them.”</p>



<p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stratford-school-of-interaction-design-and-business/people-profiles/lennart-nacke-phd">Lennart E. Nacke</a>, a professor of human-computer interaction and associate director of graduate studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who has<a href="https://lennartnacke.com/the-silent-threat-of-citation-hacking-to-academic-integrity/"> written about citation manipulation</a> and<a href="https://lennartnacke.com/content/files/2025/03/Citation-Hacking-Defence-Cheat-Sheet.pdf"> how to fight it</a>, echoed Ioannidis’s concerns.</p>



<p>”Requiring students to include three citations to papers from university-owned journals is a predatory practice and hits the most vulnerable academic population: Students, who have yet to complete their graduate degrees,” he told us. ”It sets a wrong precedent and is deceptive and despicable.”</p>



<p>An Iraqi academic told us that, to their knowledge, at least one other public institution in the country formally requires students to cite school publications to graduate. More broadly, asking students and faculty members for citations is ”common practice” in Iraq and helps journals ”elevate citations and be indexed in Scopus,” according to the source.</p>



<p>The academic, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, highlighted two recent Facebook posts illustrating such citation shenanigans. In one, the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251015135554/https:/rjes.iq/index.php/rjes/Editorialborad"> editor-in-chief of a university engineering journal</a> openly<a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=9650687878327839&amp;id=100001601686903&amp;rdid=3movBqQLSb3R4AnR"> promised an appreciation letter</a> from the institution’s dean to researchers who cited the publication’s papers in Scopus-indexed journals.</p>



<p>In the other, a <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iraq_citation_reqt_screenshot_facebook.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshot</a> shows what<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1701925596714117/permalink/4123618357878150/?rdid=V1D0MfdzHtlwvv2z"> appears to be a sloppily redacted email from Alaa H. Al-Charrakh</a>,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251015132117/https:/journals.lww.com/mjby/pages/editorialboard.aspx"> chief editorial adviser</a> at the Scopus-indexed <em>Medical Journal of Babylon</em> and a<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6533-6395"> professor at the University of Babylon</a>, to a researcher who submitted a paper to the journal. In the correspondence, Al-Charrakh requested the addition of three references to papers previously published in the journal, apparently as a condition for accepting the manuscript. </p>



<p>Al-Charrakh told us more than 3,000 papers had been submitted to the journal over the past two years and said he did “not remember writing a letter with this content.”</p>



<p>“In general,” he said, “the journal&#8217;s editorial board does not compel researchers to cite research previously published in the journal but rather asks them (optionally) to make a citation if the research topic is repeated in the journal, as follows: ‘It is preferred to make citations for at least 2 references to the <em>Medical Journal of Babylon</em> relevant to your study (if any).’”</p>



<p>In addition to citation manipulation, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/09/deputy-minister-in-iraq-losing-papers-with-signs-of-paper-mill-involvement/">Iraqi scholars say</a> fake authorship and research fraud are common in the Middle Eastern nation, which has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/iraq-corruption.html">massive problem with corruption</a> at all levels of society. Part of the reason is a lack of funding that leaves students with few options to comply with their institutions’ demands for publications (Iraq spends<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=IQ"> just 0.04%</a> of its gross domestic product on research and development, according to the World Bank). Faculty members <a href="https://doi.org/10.3167/latiss.2024.170106">are in a similar bind</a>: To be <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ministerial-order_faculty-performance-scores.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allowed to teach</a>, the Iraqi government requires them to achieve <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fK2nteQsQQq09iPlzqUzXz8gSRfDWJs0/view?usp=sharing">annual performance scores</a> that depend heavily on research published in indexed journals.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, we wrote about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-hayder-abed-dhahad-5511b4200/">Hayder Abed Dhahad</a>, Iraq’s<a href="https://mohesr.gov.iq/en/navbar/agents"> deputy minister for scientific research affairs</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-hayder-abed-dhahad-5511b4200/"> </a>who<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/10/09/deputy-minister-in-iraq-losing-papers-with-signs-of-paper-mill-involvement/"> has lost six papers</a> with signs of paper mill involvement. In an interview for that story, Dhahad, who also<a href="https://me.uotechnology.edu.iq/en/hayder-abed-dhahad/"> is a professor and vice president for scientific affairs and higher education studies</a> at the University of Technology, denied wrongdoing and stressed his ministry’s commitment to research integrity. He did not reply to a request for comment on his school’s citation requirements.</p>

<p>After more than 20 years of criticism and calls for retraction, a journal has placed an expression of concern on a study of the antidepressant Paxil in teens that critics say has led to unwarranted and potentially harmful prescribing of the drug to youth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(09)60309-9/abstract">2001 paper</a>, published in the<em> Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</em> (<em>JAACAP</em>), reported findings from a randomized trial known as “Study 329,” which concluded the antidepressant Paxil was safe and effective in kids ages 12 to 18.&nbsp; </p>



<p>In 2012, Paxil maker GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay $3 billion to settle civil and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/glaxosmithkline-plead-guilty-and-pay-3-billion-resolve-fraud-allegations-and-failure-report">criminal charges</a> that included “unlawful promotion” of the drug for adolescents, for whom the product was never approved, and allegations the company “participated in preparing, publishing and distributing a misleading medical journal article” — the <em>JAACAP </em>paper.&nbsp; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/09/16/re-analysis-of-controversial-paxil-study-shows-drug-ineffective-and-unsafe-for-teens/">A reanalysis</a> in 2015 found the drug was “ineffective and unsafe” for the age group studied.</p>



<span id="more-133106"></span>



<p>Despite these actions and other calls for retraction, the paper received its first mark this September, shortly after <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/08/25/antidepressant-paxil-gsk-medical-journal-children-adolescents-depression-ghostwriting-retraction/">a lawsuit was filed against the journal’s owner</a>, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Elsevier, which publishes the title.</p>



<p>JAACAP “is publishing this expression of concern in order to alert readers to concerns that have been raised about the article,” the <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(25)02107-0/fulltext">September 30 notice</a> reads. “Further review is underway, and an expression of concern will continue to be associated with the article until an outcome is reached.”</p>



<p><em>JAACAP </em>would not comment on why it issued the expression of concern now,&nbsp; referring us to the AACAP. Rob Grant, director of communications for the group, said the academy&nbsp; “cannot comment on the details of an ongoing review process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“AACAP and its journals take the responsibility to investigate concerns very seriously,” Grant wrote in an email to us. The expression of concern “is an interim measure while the evaluation process continues,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email, a spokesperson for Elsevier said the publisher had no additional comment about the expression of concern, and that Elsevier does not comment on legal proceedings.</p>



<p><a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mkeller">Martin B. Keller</a>, first author on the original paper and a professor emeritus of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, did not return messages seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Critics of Study 329 called the expression of concern a long time coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s great that there&#8217;s an expression of concern. It&#8217;s the first step forward after 20 years of intermittent but frequent complaining,” said Jon Jureidini, a researcher at the University of Adelaide in South Australia and a coauthor of the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4320">2015 reanalysis</a> of Study 329.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jureidini said he and others have worked for years to get <em>JAACAP </em>to retract the paper to no avail, including devoting <a href="https://study329.org/">a website</a> to the movement. The paper has been cited 451 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science, including by researchers citing the work in a positive light, Jureidini said.</p>



<p>Jureidini said he thinks the expression of concern was likely triggered by a recent lawsuit against AACAP and Elsevier. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-CAB-005368.pdf">In a complaint</a> filed September 8 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, attorney George W. Murgatroyd III argued the journal is violating the <a href="https://code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/code/titles/28/chapters/39/">D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act</a> by continuing to “publish, distribute, and sell a fraudulent scientific article that contains material facts” that mislead the public and endanger adolescent mental health and safety. AACAP and Elsevier are profiting from the article by charging readers $41.50 on the <em>JAACAP </em>website and $33.39 on Elsevier’s ScienceDirect website to buy access to the paper, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Murgatroyd, who previously represented families whose children died by suicide after taking Paxil, is suing AACAP “in his capacity as a private attorney general acting on behalf of the general public,” according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complaint contains other allegations about the paper, including that the article was ghostwritten (a charge the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Response-to-BMJ-Article-9-15-15.pdf">authors have denied</a>), that many of its authors didn’t disclose “extensive conflicts of interest,” and that at least 10 of the 22 authors made no substantial contribution to the work, a claim put forth in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989620802194384">a 2008 article</a> by Jureidini.</p>



<p>The suit seeks relief in the form of a “retraction of the Keller article along with corrective notice and reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and costs.”</p>



<p>Murgatroyd said he, too, believes the expression of concern is a response to pressure from the pending lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The mechanism of self-correction isn’t working,” he told us. “When they don’t self-correct, somebody&#8217;s got to step in and say, either you do it or the court is going to make you do it.’ There is nothing good about that article. It&#8217;s evil. It promoted drugs to kids who killed themselves. There&#8217;s nothing worse than that. You can&#8217;t allow something like that to stand.”</p>



<p>Peter Doshi, a senior editor for <em>The BMJ</em> who has been critical of Study 329 for at least a decade, called the expression of concern “devoid of detail.” The stated rationale for the notice is &#8220;to alert readers to concerns that have been raised about the article,” but it omits any mention of what those concerns are, Doshi said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doshi founded Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials (RIAT), <a href="https://restoringtrials.org/about-us/">an initiative</a> that aims to address bias in clinical trials by reporting unpublished results and re-publishing misreported trials. He and colleagues with RIAT identified Study 329 as “a misreported trial in need of restoration,” which led to the 2015 reanalysis. Doshi <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4629.full">wrote an editorial</a> in <em>The BMJ </em>that accompanied it<em>.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doshi said many unanswered questions remain about the journal’s review into the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What I’d like to know: How is this new review being carried out, by whom — the editor? the ethics committee? someone else? ” Doshi said. “What is its scope? Will its findings be published, and when can we expect conclusions?”</p>

<p>A sleuth who has identified several hundred articles describing clinical women’s health research with untrustworthy data, leading to nearly 300 retractions, has now lost one of his own papers for duplicate publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.monash.edu/medicine/scs/researchers/ben-mol">Ben Mol</a>, who leads the Evidence-based Women’s Health Care Research Group in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Monash University in Australia, has worked to <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/08/06/biologically-implausible-distributions-and-self-plagiarism-result-in-10-retractions-for-ob-gyn/">raise awareness</a> of <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data/">problematic</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">data</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/06/12/data-sleuth-flags-30-randomized-clinical-trials-from-researcher-in-egypt/">informing</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/04/03/high-profile-ob-gyn-accused-of-duplicating-data-threatens-to-sue-critic/">medical</a> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/01/18/ob-gyn-who-called-criticism-racist-and-hate-speech-earns-retraction-several-expressions-of-concern/">recommendations</a> for women’s health care, and to <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.18100">cleanse the literature</a> of unreliable studies, with <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research">major media outlets</a> covering his work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol told Retraction Watch about 50 of his papers have been investigated since 2020, usually after anonymous complaints. “It is clear that somebody had been screening my papers … in a systematic way to find any wrongdoing,” he said. His only other retraction came after he and colleagues found an error in their own work and requested the action.</p>



<span id="more-133099"></span>



<p>Mol apologized to his collaborators around the world whose work has been questioned “because of having me as a co-author.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol had begun looking for unreliable trials in the literature in 2017, according to a <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.18100">summary</a> of publishers’ responses to his team’s work. We first <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/12/researchers-face-disciplinary-action-as-dozens-of-their-studies-fall-under-scrutiny/">covered</a> his findings in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/2019/03000/pessary_compared_with_vaginal_progesterone_for_the.8.aspx">retracted paper</a> originally appeared in the journal <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em> in March 2019. The article described a randomized controlled trial at a hospital in Vietnam testing methods of preventing preterm birth for women pregnant with twins. The group, with Mol as the senior author, had presented the results at a <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(17)32447-X/fulltext">meeting</a> in February 2018, and published the <a href="https://vjog.vn/journal/article/view/693">same study</a> in the <em>Vietnamese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em> in 2018, in the Vietnamese language. They had also submitted the paper to two other major journals and been rejected, Mol said.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ben-mol.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="151" height="227" src="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ben-mol.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-122833"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ben Mol</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Mol was not aware of the Vietnamese publication, he told us, but takes “full responsibility” for the paper. “My colleagues published the Vietnamese version in ignorance, and, while it is formally not according to the rules, I have no major problem with that,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em> published a <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/citation/2019/08000/pessary_compared_with_vaginal_progesterone_for_the.34.aspx">letter</a> critiquing the paper in August 2019, which raised “several concerns with methodologic issues that compromise the internal and external validity of the study.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal received further “anonymous accusations” in 2021, Mol said, and the authors shared their data with the publication. In an email he <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F006A3F6D238BEA427E0B26F60BD4A#6">posted on PubPeer</a>, a representative from the journal wrote the editors and statistician discussed the concerns “and found no reason to think that the data are fabricated, or that the integrity of the reported study is compromised.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2023, Ahmed Mohamed Maged posted a <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F006A3F6D238BEA427E0B26F60BD4A#2">long comment</a> on PubPeer about the study. Maged, an ob-gyn at Cairo University in Egypt, has had 10 papers retracted and nine more marked with expressions of concern after Mol and colleagues <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0041-1727280">examined 22 trials</a> Maged published and found “potential data integrity issues” in some of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do not think any of his comments are substantial,” Mol told us. Maged has left comments on PubPeer about several of Mol’s other papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol said the journal contacted the authors in June about the earlier publication. The retraction <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/citation/2025/10000/notice_of_retraction___pessary_compared_with.18.aspx">notice</a> appeared in the journal’s October issue, citing “duplicate publication” as the reason for retraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The authors have stated that the duplication was not intentional,” the notice states. It also states the first author had said Mol and another author were not aware of the initial publication, but the journal “is unable to independently verify this assertion.”</p>



<p>The <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology </em>article has been cited 34 times, according to Clarivate&#8217;s Web of Science. </p>



<p>“Formally the retraction is correct and according to the rules,” Mol told us, although he questioned whether it was “that bad” to have the prior publication in Vietnamese and in a journal not indexed in PubMed. The authors suggested adding a sentence to the retraction notice stating they agreed with the retraction, he said, but the journal did not do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F006A3F6D238BEA427E0B26F60BD4A#3">August</a> and <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F006A3F6D238BEA427E0B26F60BD4A#4">September</a>, anonymous users commented on the paper asserting there were “discrepancies” between the two versions. Mol <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/F006A3F6D238BEA427E0B26F60BD4A#6">replied</a>, explaining the two papers had used a different clinical cut-off value, and one of the commenters had incorrectly extracted data from the papers for a comparison table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol pointed us to <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/2003/05000/oral_misoprostol_for_the_third_stage_of_labor__a.17.aspx">another article</a> in <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em>&nbsp; for which Mol and a colleague <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DB633A8DA5B58568DF223D9F33175E">had</a> <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/B00304F9FDC5554D9A9F5FCB406888#1">identified</a> similarities in the data&nbsp; to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937802002934">previously published trial</a> by some of the same authors, but <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em> editors responded they would not pursue any action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We reached out to Jason D. Wright, the journal’s editor-in-chief, for comment on the retraction of Mol’s paper or the other case he raised. We received a response from Stephanie Casway, the journal’s managing editor, with a formal statement from the journal:&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journal adheres to the guidelines established by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). In keeping with our policies, we do not comment on ongoing or completed investigations. We approach retractions with care, ensuring they are issued deliberately, responsibly, and in accordance with ethical standards.</p>



<p>The retraction is Mol’s second. In 2021, he and the same group of colleagues <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(20)31403-4/fulltext">retracted</a> a paper after they found “a data analysis error resulting in a different conclusion,” according to the notice. They later republished a <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aogs.14545">corrected version</a>. One other paper of Mol’s with a different group of collaborators has received an <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(24)00189-4/fulltext">erratum</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mol told us he expected such retractions of his papers after he started whistleblowing on problematic articles, and he expects “some more of these unintended errors will come up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The big problem is that almost everyone in the academic and clinical community is looking away” from the problem of untrustworthy trials in women’s health, he said. He estimates “at least 30%” of the literature in the field may be unreliable. A relatively small group of authors and institutions “contributes to this large volume of problematic papers,” he said, and “peer review has not been picking this up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not many in the field speak out about the problem, he said.</p>



<p>As a result, the ones who do receive “the full monty,” he said. “Still, for me, it is worth it in view of the 275 retracted papers and 100 expressions of concern” for unreliable papers he has flagged, “and more important, the awareness that has been raised and the system changes that we have already seen with many journals and publishers.”</p>

                Low- and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCSs), such as aspartame and saccharin, have become part of daily life for millions of people. Found in diet sodas, protein powders and sugar-free snacks, these sweeteners deliver sweetness without calories or spiking blood sugar levels, making them marketable for people trying to cut back on sugar or manage conditions such as type 2 diabetes. New research, however, sheds light on the possible effects of LNCSs on cognitive function, finding that their...

<p>A dean and professor at a public university in Iraq has lost another paper just weeks after we reported he was<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/09/05/yasser-fakri-mustafa-iraq-mosul-university-dean-paper-mills-retractions/"> up to 16 retractions</a> for authorship manipulation, fake peer review and other problems.</p>



<p>Yasser Fakri Mustafa of the University of Mosul was a coauthor of the newly<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17434440.2022"> retracted article</a>, a review of how aerosol boxes affected intubation during the COVID‐19 pandemic. He denied wrongdoing.</p>



<p>As stated in the<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17434440.2025.2563428"> retraction notice</a>, online September 23, the article’s title matched an authorship ad posted on social media on March 9, 2022, eight months before <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17434440.2022.2132149">the paper</a> appeared in Taylor &amp; Francis’ <em>Expert Review of Medical Devices</em>.</p>



<span id="more-133094"></span>



<p>The advertised work and the published paper also had “significant overlap” in abstracts and keywords,<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/18/nick-wise-sleuth-publisher-taylor-francis/"> then-sleuth Nick Wise</a> pointed out in<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/2041987DC33ED805E38BF27745CBF8?utm_source=Firefox&amp;utm_medium=BrowserExtension&amp;utm_campaign=Firefox"> a PubPeer post</a> from August 2023 that included a screenshot of the Facebook authorship ad.</p>



<p>In August of this year, Wise, by then a research integrity manager at Taylor &amp; Francis, contacted the authors of the offending article, according to an email we have seen.</p>



<p>“When contacted for an explanation, the corresponding author confirmed the article had been obtained from a concerning source and requested that the article was retracted,” the retraction notice states.</p>



<p>The corresponding author is<a href="https://scholar.unair.ac.id/en/persons/trias-mahmudiono-3"> Trias Mahmudiono</a> of Universitas Airlangga in Surabaya, Indonesia, who has earned<a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dTrias%2bMahmudiono"> two retractions</a> for violation of authorship policies. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>



<p>Mustafa, who appears last in the author list, shared his correspondence with the publisher, which shows he did not reply to Wise’s email from August until the day after the retraction notice appeared. In his belated reply, he disagreed with Taylor &amp; Francis’ move.</p>



<p>Mustafa told us he would like to see a link to the original Facebook post Wise had found, “rather than a screenshot, which can easily be fabricated.” He added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Even if we hypothetically assume the PubPeer allegation to be accurate, the purportedly “offered” positions correspond to the second and fourth authors, whereas my position is the eleventh. This clearly indicates that I did not purchase authorship but contributed within the legitimate writing and review process. Since the corresponding author consented to the retraction, it remains plausible that he might have offered those authorship positions without informing the remaining co-authors.</p>
